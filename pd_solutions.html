<p>Question 1 <br/>Answer: 4 <br/>Option (4) is correct because a latent defect is a defect which is not immediately discoverable upon a reasonable <br/>inspection of the property. Option (1) is incorrect because a defect immediately visible to the eye is a patent <br/>defect. Option (2) is incorrect because a latent defect is required to be disclosed by the seller not the buyer. <br/>Option (3) is incorrect because a latent defect is the responsibility of the seller to disclose. <br/></p>
<p>Question 2 <br/>Answer: 3  <br/>Option (3) is correct because the immobility of land renders real property more subject real property to the <br/>effects of externalities than most assets. An owner cannot move his or her real property to a more desirable <br/>location with beneficial externalities. Similarly, an owner cannot move his or her property away from a location <br/>subject or negative externalities. This characteristic of land has the greatest effect on the value of a real property <br/>asset. Options (1), (2), and (4) are therefore incorrect. <br/></p>
<p>Question 3 <br/>Answer: 1 <br/>Option (1) is correct because construction of a building is not a real estate service under the Real Estate Services <br/>Act. Option (2) is incorrect because collecting rents from tenants is defined as &#8220;rental property management <br/>services&#8221; which fall under &#8220;real estate services&#8221; in the Real Estate Services Act. Options (3) and (4) are incorrect <br/>because selling or assisting in the sale of properties is defined as &#8220;trading services&#8221; which fall under &#8220;real estate <br/>services&#8221; in the Real Estate Services Act.  <br/></p>
<p>Question 4 <br/>Answer: 4 <br/>Option (4) is correct; corporations are subject to income tax as a separate legal entity. Options (1) and (2) are <br/>incorrect because both sole proprietors and partners need to report their business income on their personal <br/>income tax returns. Option (3) is incorrect because corporations have different tax liability from proprietors <br/>and partners in that corporations are taxed as a separate legal entity. <br/></p>
<p>Question 5 <br/>Answer: 2  <br/>Option (2) is correct because a real estate agency relationship depends on mutual consent, and therefore either <br/>party can terminate the relationship at will. An agent&#8217;s authority can be revoked orally or by conduct, and an <br/>act of the principal that is inconsistent with the continuation of authority terminates the relationship. Options <br/>(1) and (4) are incorrect because these scenarios do not terminate the agency relationship. They relate to the <br/>principal&#8217;s duty to pay real estate commission to the agent. Option (3) is incorrect because an agent&#8217;s offer to <br/>personally purchase the principal&#8217;s property is a conflict of interest. While such conflicts should be avoided, <br/>they do not terminate the agency relationship.   </p>


<p>Question 6 <br/>Answer: 4 <br/>Find the payments, rounded up to the nearest dollar, based on the terms of the mortgage contract that is given <br/>in the question. <br/> <br/>Press Display <br/>7 &#61568; NOM% 7 <br/>1 &#61568; P/YR 1 <br/>&#61568; EFF% 7 <br/>12 &#61568; P/YR 12 <br/>&#61568; NOM%  6.784974 <br/>170000 PV 170,000 <br/>0 FV 0 <br/>240 N 240 <br/>PMT  &#61473;1,296.15607 <br/></p>
<p>Question 7 <br/>Answer: 4 <br/>Option (4) is correct because a municipal council will hold a public hearing before adopting, amending or <br/>repealing a bylaw. Options (1) and (2) are incorrect because the power to zone has been delegated to the <br/>municipality by the Province, and the Province has not retained the right to decide zoning matters. Option (3) is <br/>incorrect because a municipal council typically issues notice of a public hearing to neighbouring properties, <br/>but no specified written notice is required. <br/></p>
<p>Question 8 <br/>Answer: 1 <br/>Option (1) is correct because the subject of a real property appraisal is the particular rights of ownership vested <br/>in a certain piece of real estate. Air space rights are a legal interest in real property. Options (2), (3), and (4) are <br/>incorrect because these do not describe legal interests in real property.  <br/></p>
<p>Question 9 <br/>Answer: 3 <br/>Option (3) is correct because the plaintiff may originate an action either in the jurisdiction where the <br/>circumstances giving rise to the claim arose, or in the jurisdiction where the defendant resides or carries on <br/>business. Options (1), (2), and (4) are incorrect for this reason. <br/></p>
<p>Question 10 <br/>Answer: 4 <br/>Option (4) is correct and (1), (2), and (3) are incorrect because the principle of indefeasibility means that if a <br/>person is named on a certificate of title as the owner of the fee simple estate in land, then that is conclusive <br/>proof, as far as the world is concerned, that he or she is entitled to that fee simple estate. </p>


<p>Question 11 <br/>Answer: 3 <br/>Option (3) is correct because if the landlord notifies the tenant of entry to re-let the premises, he will not lose his <br/>rights against the tenant. Option (1) is incorrect because the doctrine of frustration only applies when events <br/>outside of the control of the parties fundamentally change the subject matter of the contract. In this case, an <br/>abandonment of commercial premises would not frustrate the contract. Option (2) is incorrect because even if <br/>the landlord did not provide notice, the tenant would not have grounds for an action in trespass, as the <br/>landlord has a right to enter incidental to the right to levy a distress. Option (4) is incorrect because the <br/>covenant of quiet enjoyment protects the tenant&#8217;s right to the premises. Here, the tenant has abandoned the <br/>premises and the landlord would not be breaching the covenant by entering the premises. <br/></p>
<p>Question 12 <br/>Answer: 4 <br/>Option (4) is correct because the amount of property insurance does not affect the risk to the lender, and <br/>therefore will not be considered in determining the appropriate rate. Options (1) and (2) are incorrect because <br/>the borrower&#8217;s credit rating and the type of property affect the risk of the loan to the lender. Option (3) is <br/>incorrect because a lender will set an appropriate rate of return based on the risk of lending, as well as the <br/>amount of administrative work required.  <br/></p>
<p>Question 13 <br/>Answer: 1 <br/>Option (1) is correct because a commercial lease for a fixed term terminates at the end of the term, on the <br/>specified end date. Options (2), (3), and (4) are incorrect for this reason. <br/></p>
<p>Question 14 <br/>Answer: 3  <br/>Option (3) is the correct answer because it is not a possible meaning of the term &#8220;common law&#8221;. The body of <br/>laws created by the Federal government (i.e., by the federal legislature) is referred to as statute law. Option (1) is <br/>incorrect because the term &#8220;common law&#8221; often broadly refers to the law created by the courts, based in either <br/>common-law or equitable principles. Option (2) is incorrect because another possible meaning of &#8220;common <br/>law&#8221; is the original set of court-developed principles, which evolved separately from equitable principles, before <br/>these two courts merged. Option (4) is incorrect because the doctrine of stare decisis underlies the binding <br/>nature of precedent within the common law.  <br/></p>
<p>Question 15 <br/>Answer: 2  <br/>Option (2) is the correct answer because it is false. Separate consideration needs to be given to create an option <br/>agreement and keep the offer open. Option (1) is incorrect because it is true &#8211; revocation of an offer can happen <br/>at any time prior to the expiration of the offer. Option (3) is incorrect because any changes that Harvey makes to <br/>the offer would be considered a counter-offer. A counter-offer must be accepted by Mary, so it effectively <br/>terminates her original offer. Option (4) is incorrect because revocation must actually be communicated to <br/>Harvey. There is no &#8220;postal acceptance rule&#8221; with regards to revocation. </p>


<p>Question 16 <br/>Answer: 2 <br/>Find the new PV, given that the payments remain at $1,413, but the market value of the mortgage changes <br/>because the new rates are 12% per annum, compounded semi-annually. This rate is higher than the contract <br/>rate; therefore, we would expect the PV of the loan to be lower. Also, we only have 8 years, or 96 N, left on the <br/>mortgage.  <br/>  <br/>Press Display <br/>12 &#61568; NOM%  12 <br/>2 &#61568; P/YR 2 <br/>&#61568; EFF%  12.36 <br/>12 &#61568; P/YR 12 <br/>&#61568; NOM%  11.710553 <br/>96 N 96 <br/>1413 +/- PMT &#61473;1,413 <br/>0 FV 0 <br/>PV  87,795.457654 (market value of mortgage) <br/>+ 50000 =  137,795.457654 (market value of the offer) <br/> <br/>The market value of the offer is $137,795.  <br/></p>
<p>Question 17 <br/>Answer: 4  <br/>Option (4) is correct because an omnibus clause allows the mortgagee to pay monies to be paid by the <br/>mortgagor (e.g., property taxes or strata charges) if unpaid and such amounts are added to the principal <br/>secured. Options (1), (2), and (3) are incorrect as these clauses are not applicable in such a situation. <br/></p>
<p>Question 18 <br/>Answer: 2 <br/>Option (2) is the correct answer because the form is compatible across mobile devices, therefore it is not an <br/>example of a technological capability issue. Options (1), (3), and (4) are all examples of technological <br/>compatibility issues and are therefore incorrect.  <br/></p>
<p>Question 19 <br/>Answer: 2 <br/>Option (2) is correct because there is a seven day rescission right whereby the purchaser can serve written <br/>notice of rescission seven days after giving a written statement that they have read the disclosure statement. <br/>Options (1), (3), and (4) are incorrect for this reason. <br/></p>
<p>Question 20 <br/>Answer: 4 <br/>Option (4) is true because the ceiling price of a buyer is subjective and could be any value; for example, far <br/>above the appraised value. Option (1) is incorrect as there are no licensing requirements for real estate <br/>appraisers. Option (2) is incorrect because the recognized margin of error for an appraisal of an usual property <br/>or a market with few participants will likely be much higher than 5% to 10%. Option (3) is incorrect as there is <br/>no legal requirement for a specific appraisal license or designation that would prevent a qualified licensed real <br/>estate representative from performing an appraisal. </p>


<p>Question 21 <br/>Answer: 1 <br/>Option (1) is correct because Peter has ratified the contract, which means he has consented to the unauthorized <br/>acts of the agent. Therefore, Peter is bound by the contract just as if Alan had been authorized to make it in the <br/>first place. He cannot sue for breach of warranty of authority. Option (2) is incorrect because revocation refers to <br/>terminating authority, not creating it. Option (3) is incorrect because apparent authority arises from agency by <br/>estoppel. Agency by estoppel is not present here, as there was no representation made by Peter, reliance by a <br/>third party and an alteration of the third party&#8217;s position based on that reliance. Option (4) is incorrect because <br/>Option (1) is true. <br/></p>
<p>Question 22 <br/>Answer: 3 <br/>Option (3) is correct because a positive adjustment of $6,700 for bathrooms indicates that the comparable has <br/>one less bathroom than the subject property (3 bathrooms), and a positive adjustment of $5,500 for the air <br/>conditioner indicates that the comparable does not have an air conditioner. Options (1), (2), and (4) are <br/>incorrect for this reason. <br/></p>
<p>Question 23 <br/>Answer: 1 <br/>Option (1) is correct because an appeal from small claims court is to the British Columbia Supreme Court. <br/>Options (2), (3), and (4) are incorrect for this reason. <br/></p>
<p>Question 24 <br/>Answer: 4 <br/>The maximum loan granted will be the lower amount of the loan-to-value constraint and the DCR constraint. <br/> <br/>Using the DCR constraint, calculate the maximum allowable payments.  <br/></p>

<p>Question 25 <br/>Answer: 3 <br/>Option (3) is relevant and therefore correct because although Herb offered a case of wine as present <br/>consideration, the cleaning of the gutters was past consideration. Since past consideration is no consideration, <br/>no contract formed between Herb and Zelda. Option (1) is incorrect because an invitation to treat is typically an <br/>advertisement or other statement from one party inviting another party to make a legal offer. No invitation to <br/>treat appears in this scenario. Option (2) is incorrect because there is no voidable contract to be repudiated on <br/>the facts. Option (4) is not relevant because the issue is whether there was consideration to give rise to a valid <br/>contract in the first place. <br/></p>
<p>Question 26 <br/>Answer: 4 <br/>Option (4) is correct because the cost principle states that a company must record the value of an asset as the <br/>price paid at the time of acquisition. Option (1) is incorrect because the objectivity principle states that all <br/>values must be objective and verifiable. Option (2) is incorrect because the consistency principle states that once <br/>a company adopts a certain accounting policy, they should continue to use that same policy. Option (3) is <br/>incorrect because the revenue recognition principle states that revenue must be recorded when it is earned, not <br/>when cash is received. <br/></p>
<p>Question 27 <br/>Answer: 1 <br/>Option (1) is correct because a contractual relationship does not need to exist between the parties when a <br/>negligent misrepresentation is made. For example, a licensee acting for a seller could be held liable for <br/>negligent misrepresentation for a statement made to a buyer despite having no contractual relationship with <br/>the buyer. Option (2) is incorrect because the statement made may be fact or opinion as the representative is a <br/>skilled person and the other party may reasonably rely on it. Option (3) is incorrect because there is a <br/>requirement of reliance on the statement and resulting damage from that reliance to establish a claim of <br/>negligent misrepresentation. Option (4) is incorrect because a representative can make a clear disclaimer that <br/>they will not be liable for the accuracy of the statement.  <br/></p>
<p>Question 28 <br/>Answer: 2 <br/>Option (2) is the correct answer as it is the only option listed that does not affect the legal rights of ownership of <br/>the property. Options (1), (3), and (4) represent legal interests or charges that will affect the appraiser&#8217;s estimate <br/>of market value. <br/></p>
<p>Question 29 <br/>Answer: 1 <br/>Option (1) is correct because the book value of an asset is calculated as the purchase price of the asset, less all of <br/>the accumulated depreciation to date. Options (2) and (3) are incorrect as they both refer to the market value of <br/>the asset, and Option (4) is incorrect as it refers to the appraised value of an asset. <br/></p>
<p>Question 30 <br/>Answer: 1 <br/>Option (1) is correct because the duty to mitigate damages means that the innocent party must try to reduce the <br/>loss suffered as a result of the breach. In this case, reducing the loss of income from the rent would occur by <br/>re-renting the premises as soon as possible. Options (2), (3), and (4) are incorrect as they refer to other legal <br/>principles.  </p>


<p>Question 31 <br/>Answer: 3 <br/>Option (3) is correct because cryptomizing information protects it by encrypting it into an unreadable format. <br/>Only those with a secret key or code can decipher the information. Options (1), (2), and (4) are incorrect for this <br/>reason. <br/></p>
<p>Question 32 <br/>Answer: 2 <br/>Option (2) is correct as it describes a mortgage. Options (1) and (4) are incorrect because a mortgage does not <br/>necessarily need to be registered to be effective between the parties. This principle is embodied in section 20(1) <br/>of the Land Title Act. Option (3) is incorrect because a mortgage is not a loan. It is an interest in land created by <br/>contract as security for a loan made by a lender to the borrower.  <br/></p>
<p>Question 33 <br/>Answer: 1 <br/>Option (1) is false and therefore correct, because the allowable margin of error is 10%, and the $3,000 error falls <br/>within this margin. Options (2), (3), and (4) are incorrect because these statements are all true. <br/></p>
<p>Question 34 <br/>Answer: 2 <br/>Option (2) is correct. Land is not considered to be a depreciable asset and thus, depreciation expense is never <br/>taken on land. Depreciation expense is only taken on the building. <br/></p>
<p>Book Value = Cost &#61473; Accumulated Depreciation  <br/>Book Value = $1,700,000 &#61473; ($50,000 &#61512; 10) = $1,200,000 <br/></p>
<p>Question 35 <br/>Answer: 4 <br/>Option (4) is correct because a licensee is required to provide a Disclosure of Interest in Trade form when there <br/>is an offer by the licensee to directly or indirectly acquire real estate. An offer by Chad&#8217;s friend is neither of <br/>these. Option (1) is incorrect because an offer by a corporation in which Chad owns over 5% of the shares is an <br/>offer to indirectly acquire real estate. Option (2) is incorrect because an offer by Chad&#8217;s wife is also an offer to <br/>indirectly acquire real estate. Option (3) is incorrect because it is a direct offer to acquire real estate. In these <br/>three situations, Chad must provide a Disclosure of Interest in Trade form. <br/></p>

<p>Question 37 <br/>Answer: 2 <br/>Option (2) is correct and Options (1), (3), and (4) are incorrect because a revocation of an offer is only effective <br/>when it is communicated to the offeree. <br/></p>
<p>Question 38 <br/>Answer: 3 <br/>Option (3) is correct because &#8220;public law&#8221; deals with the Constitution and matters between private individuals <br/>and the state. Options (1) and (2) are incorrect because these fall under the category of &#8220;private law&#8221;.  <br/></p>
<p>Question 39 <br/>Answer: 3 <br/>Option (3) is correct because the occupation of the parties is not required in a notice of the end of the tenancy <br/>agreement by a tenant. Options (1), (2), and (4) are incorrect they are all required in a notice of the end of the <br/>tenancy agreement.  <br/></p>
<p>Question 40 <br/>Answer: 4 <br/>Option (4) is the correct answer as the depreciation approach is not a method of appraisal. Options (1), (2), and <br/>(3) all represent valid appraisal approaches and are therefore incorrect. <br/></p>
<p>Question 41 <br/>Answer: 3 <br/>Option (3) is correct because there is a duty on the real estate licensee to tell his or her client everything relevant <br/>to the transaction within the agent&#8217;s knowledge. In this case, because the licensee has a personal interest in the <br/>transaction, he must disclose it to the client, but the transaction is not automatically prohibited. Options (1), (2), <br/>and (4) are therefore incorrect. <br/></p>
<p>Question 42 <br/>Answer: 1 <br/>Option (1) is correct because First Nation reserve land constitutes an exclusively federal undertaking under the <br/>Constitution Act, 1867, and therefore, provincial legislation such as the Strata Property Act (&#8220;SPA&#8221;) generally <br/>does not apply on such lands, subject to the leasehold landlord provisions in the SPA. Option (2) is incorrect <br/>because while the owners may apply to the Civil Resolution Tribunal (CRT) to make binding decisions when a <br/>dispute arises, the CRT&#8217;s role does not involve proactive efforts such as random audits to ensure compliance. <br/>Option (3) is incorrect because all strata corporations are required to hold annual general meetings to comply <br/>with the SPA, regardless of their size. There are, however, options for strata corporations to waive the <br/>requirement to hold an annual general meeting. Option (4) is incorrect because the same fundamental legal <br/>principles apply to all strata developments, and commercial and industrial strata developments are not subject <br/>to enhanced compliance requirements under the SPA. <br/></p>
<p>Question 43 <br/>Answer: 2 <br/>A property possesses latent value if its current state does not represent its highest and best use. Option (2) <br/>possesses latent value as the property would have more value if the single-family home was removed and a <br/>commercial use building was developed. Options (1), (3), and (4) are incorrect, as these properties are currently <br/>being utilized at their highest and best use.  </p>


<p>Question 44 <br/>Answer: 3 <br/>Option (3) is false and therefore correct, because the representations covered by section 52 can be by &#8220;any <br/>means whatsoever&#8221; and can include oral representations. They are not limited to just print and digital <br/>representations. Options (1), (2), and (4) are true statements and are therefore incorrect. <br/></p>
<p>Question 45 <br/>Answer: 4 <br/>Option (4) is correct as it describes the term &#8220;unit entitlement&#8221;. Options (1), (2), and (3) are false because unit <br/>entitlement refers to determining each owner&#8217;s proportionate, undivided ownership share of the common <br/>property in the strata plan. It is used to determine the share of the strata corporation&#8217;s expenses and liabilities <br/>for which each strata lot owner is responsible.  <br/></p>
<p>Question 46 <br/>Answer: 2 <br/>LTV = 80% <br/>Lending Value = $270,000 <br/> Maximum loan under lender&#8217;s LTV criteria = 0.80 &#61512; $270,000 = $216,000 <br/></p>
<p>Question 47 <br/>Answer: 3 <br/>Find the minimum borrower&#8217;s income necessary given the monthly payments of $1,120 and annual property <br/>taxes of $2,500. <br/>  <br/></p>
<p>Minimum income = PIT &#247; GDSR  <br/>= [($1,120 &#61512; 12) + $2,500] &#247; 0.32 <br/>= $15,940 &#247; 0.32 <br/>= $49,812.50 <br/></p>
<p>Question 48 <br/>Answer: 2 <br/>Option (2) is correct because the BC Financial Services Authority (BCFSA) may only use funds from <br/>administrative penalties for educational purposes, and specifically, to educate the public, licensees, and other <br/>participants in the real estate industry about the operation and regulation of the industry and issues related to <br/>real estate and real estate services. The remaining options are incorrect because BCFSA has authority to <br/>exercise those powers. <br/></p>
<p>Question 49 <br/>Answer: 4 <br/>Option (4) is correct because it is an example of an inefficient use in heating. Large windows and doors facing <br/>south are desirable to make a home as energy efficient as possible. Options (1), (2), and (3) represent <br/>characteristics of an energy efficient home and are therefore incorrect. </p>


<p>Question 50 <br/>Answer: 2 <br/>Option (2) is correct because it describes a mortgage. A mortgage is not a loan itself; it is an interest in land that <br/>provides security for the loan. Option (1) is incorrect because the first registered mortgage provides the lender <br/>with a legal (rather than an equitable) right of redemption. This is subject to the borrower&#8217;s equity of <br/>redemption, which allows the borrower to repay the mortgage after the contractual date for payment. Option (3) <br/>is incorrect because a mortgage lender can lose its priority over certain charges even though the mortgage was <br/>registered first. Examples of these include builders liens, Strata Property Act judgments, property tax liens, <br/>wage claim certificates and workers compensation claims. Option (4) is incorrect because retaining the <br/>mortgagor&#8217;s duplicate certificate of title to the land creates an equitable mortgage. The lender cannot register <br/>this equitable mortgage as a charge at the land title office. <br/></p>
<p>Question 51 <br/>Answer: 1  <br/>Option (1) is correct. The first registered mortgage is a legal mortgage, while any subsequent registered <br/>mortgage will be an equitable mortgage charging the borrower&#8217;s equity of redemption. Option (2) is therefore <br/>incorrect. Option (3) is incorrect because an assignment of a first mortgage is done by the lender to a third <br/>party, who is then entitled to enforce the lender&#8217;s rights directly against the borrower. Option (4) is incorrect <br/>because a vendor take-back mortgage occurs only where a purchaser of property grants a mortgage interest to <br/>the vendor of that property.  <br/></p>
<p>Question 52 <br/>Answer: 3  <br/>Option (3) is correct because originally, the word &#8220;fee&#8221; meant that the estate could be inherited, and the word <br/>&#8220;simple&#8221; meant that there was no qualification on the type of heir that could inherit. Option (1) is incorrect <br/>because a fee simple estate is a greater interest in land than a leasehold estate, which time-limited. Option (2) is <br/>incorrect because if the owner of the estate in fee simple does not dispose of a property by will, the owner&#8217;s heirs <br/>will inherit the estate in fee simple. Option (4) is incorrect because the concept of fee simple was created before <br/>the Torrens system of registration. <br/></p>
<p>Question 53 <br/>Answer: 4 <br/>Option (4) is correct. The form the subject matter of a grant, the easement must be capable of reasonably exact <br/>definition, and the party who grants and whose land benefits from the easement must have the necessary <br/>capacity to be grantor and grantee. Option (1) is incorrect because an easement can be either positive or <br/>negative in nature (in comparison to a restrictive covenant, which must be negative in nature). Option (2) is <br/>incorrect because the easement must accommodate the dominant tenement, not the servient tenement. Option <br/>(3) is incorrect because one party can own both the dominant and servient tenement provided that they are two <br/>different parcels of land. <br/></p>
<p>Question 54 <br/>Answer: 3 <br/>Option (3) is correct because mortgage lenders may pre-approve a potential borrower for a mortgage based on <br/>his or her current financial situation and a satisfactory credit review. Options (1), (2) and (4) are incorrect. <br/></p>
<p>Question 55 <br/>Answer: 4 <br/>Option (4) is correct because a pulp mill in Squamish is likely very unique without any comparable properties, <br/>so the cost approach must be used. Options (1), (2), and (3) are incorrect because these are likely inappropriate <br/>methods to appraise such a property, given its unique character.  </p>


<p>Question 56 <br/>Answer: 3 <br/>Option (3) is correct because the overriding principle of specific performance is that it will not be exercised <br/>when damages are an adequate remedy. Options (1), (2), and (4) are incorrect because they are irrelevant to the <br/>determination of an award of specific performance. <br/></p>
<p>Question 57 <br/>Answer: 2 <br/>Option (2) is correct because the act of test driving the car and having it inspected is necessary in order to <br/>enable Tim to carry out the express authority and is incidental to that authority. It is therefore an example of <br/>implied authority. Option (1) is incorrect because it is an example of express authority. Option (3) and (4) are <br/>incorrect because they are examples of acts that Tim does not have actual or apparent authority to do. <br/>Therefore, authority cannot be implied for these acts.  <br/></p>
<p>Question 58 <br/>Answer: 4 <br/>Option (4) is the correct answer because consumers should clearly be able to differentiate a licensee&#8217;s own <br/>listings from other available properties. Option (1) is incorrect because the name of the brokerage must appear <br/>in a prominent and easily readable form on all internet and social media advertising vehicles. Option (2) is <br/>incorrect because licensees should NOT advertise other licensees&#8217; listings directly on their own website without <br/>the approval of the listing licensee. Option (3) is incorrect because if a licensee is a member of a team, the team <br/>name has to be included in social media advertising as well as on the licensee&#8217;s website. <br/></p>
<p>Question 59 <br/>Answer: 4 <br/>Option (4) is correct because section 1 of the Strata Property Act defines common property as any property not <br/>designated as strata lots on a strata plan. Options (1), (2), and (3) are incorrect because common property is <br/>owned by the members of the strata corporation, each in the proportion set out in the Schedule of Unit <br/>Entitlement.  <br/></p>
<p>Question 60 <br/>Answer: 4 <br/>Option (4) is the correct answer; Options (1), (2), and (3) are all included in the residential borrower <br/>qualification process. Lenders engage in many types of analysis to qualify a borrower to reduce the risk of <br/>lending. <br/></p>
<p>Question 61 <br/>Answer: 4 <br/>Option (4) is correct because none of the other statements accurately describe the requirement of writing. <br/>Option (1) is incorrect because an unwritten contract or disposition of land can be enforced against a party who <br/>has done or acquiesced in an act that indicates that contract or disposition has been made. It can also be <br/>enforced if the person alleging the contract or disposition has changed his position in reliance on such an act <br/>and it would be inequitable not to enforce the contract or disposition. Given this, Option (2) is also incorrect. <br/>Option (3) is incorrect because there is no requirement that a contract for the sale of land be contained in one <br/>written document. </p>


<p>Question 62 <br/>Answer: 2 <br/>Option (2) is correct. Option (1) is false as the date on which adjustments are made between the parties for <br/>property taxes, interest, rent and other appropriate items is known as the adjustment date. Option (3) is false <br/>because the possession date is not always the same date as the completion date. Registration (performed on the <br/>completion date) takes some time to effect, so to set the possession date on the same date as the completion date <br/>may not be ideal. Option (4) is false because the buyer assumes responsibility for risk of loss or damage to the <br/>property on the completion date, when the buyer is registered on title at the Land Title Office. <br/></p>
<p>Question 63 <br/>Answer: 2 <br/>Option (2) is correct because the term of a mortgage is the contractual period for which a borrower will make <br/>constant payments to the lender. Option (1) is incorrect because a partially amortized mortgage would not <br/>require payment of an outstanding balance at the end of the term. This is only required in the instance where a <br/>mortgage is fully amortized and the term length equals the amortization period. Option (3) is incorrect because <br/>incorrect because the term length of a partially amortized mortgage would be less than the amortization period. <br/>Option (4) is incorrect because the term length of a fully amortized mortgage would be equal to the <br/>amortization period. <br/></p>
<p>Question 64 <br/>Answer: 2 <br/>Option (2) is correct because a building scheme is defined in the Land Title Act as a set of restrictive covenants <br/>imposed on two or more lots within a particular subdivision, generally used to maintain uniformity of the lots <br/>to protect their value. Option (1) is incorrect because building schemes are used to impose restrictions on all <br/>owners of the affected properties, while easements are granted to confer rights to the dominant tenement. <br/>Option (3) is incorrect because the restrictive covenants in a building scheme will disallow the buyer from <br/>building to their own tastes if these contravene the covenants. Option (4) is incorrect because a building scheme <br/>is registered by a Declaration of Creation of a Building Scheme which is separate from any required disclosure <br/>statement. <br/></p>
<p>Question 65 <br/>Answer: 4 <br/>Calculate the required payments according to the loan contract, then calculate the cost of funds advanced using <br/>a present value that is net of commission, appraisal, survey, and legal fees. <br/> <br/>Press Display <br/>8 &#61568; NOM% 8 <br/>2 &#61568; P/YR 2 <br/>&#61568; EFF% 8.16 <br/>12 &#61568; P/YR 12 <br/>&#61568; NOM% 7.869836 <br/>240000 PV 240,000 <br/>180 N 180 <br/>0 FV 0 <br/>PMT  &#61473;2,275.567074 <br/>2275.57 +/&#61473; PMT &#61473;2,275.57 <br/>228400 PV 228,400 ($240,000 &#61473; $8,000 &#61473; $2,000 &#61473; $600 &#61473; $1,000)  <br/>I/YR 8.696795 (j12) <br/>&#61568; EFF% 9.051965 (j1) </p>


<p>Question 66 <br/>Answer: 4 <br/>Option (4) is correct and Options (1), (2), and (3) are incorrect because the three requirements for a statutory <br/>assignment are that it is in writing, it is absolute and unconditional, and notice of the assignment is given to the <br/>original promissor.  <br/></p>
<p>Question 67 <br/>Answer: 2 <br/>Option (2) is correct because in the comparable property has 1 fewer bedroom and 1 fewer bathroom. <br/>Therefore, in relation to the subject property, this comparable will need an adjustment of +$3,200 for 1 <br/>bedroom and +$5,700 for 1 bathroom. Options (1), (3), and (4) are incorrect for this reason. <br/></p>
<p>Question 68 <br/>Answer: 3  <br/>Press  Display <br/>6 I/YR  6 <br/>12 &#61568; P/YR  12 <br/>75000 PV  75,000 <br/>75000 +/&#61473;FV  &#61473;75,000 <br/>1 N  1 <br/>PMT  &#61473;375 <br/> <br/>Alternative Solution <br/>Press  Display  <br/>6 &#247; 12 =  0.5 <br/>%  0.005 <br/>&#61512; 75000 =  375 <br/></p>
<p> <br/>With an interest only loan, all periodic payments until the end of the term of the loan are interest payments and <br/>are identical. Ally will make monthly interest only payments of $375.  <br/></p>
<p>Question 69 <br/>Answer: 1 <br/>Option (1) is correct because the salesperson likely has a duty of care towards Kim when coming onto her <br/>property and demonstrating something to her. He may be found to have breached the standard of care by <br/>failing to take reasonable precautions not to damage her property. Option (2) is incorrect because the <br/>salesperson is not an occupier, and the Occupiers Liability Act deals only with liability to an occupier. Option <br/>(3) is incorrect because the fact that the salesperson is a trespasser does not bar Kim from recovering damages <br/>stemming from his conduct on her property. Option (4) is incorrect because the salesperson&#8217;s actions are more <br/>akin to trespass than private nuisance. The fact that the salesperson entered onto Kim&#8217;s land and placed <br/>something upon it and that it was an isolated occurrence point towards trespass rather than private nuisance.  <br/></p>
<p>Question 70 <br/>Answer: 2 <br/>Find the property&#8217;s loan-to-value ratio using the value of the mortgage and the property&#8217;s lending value. <br/> <br/></p>
<p>$84,000 =70%<br/>$120,000<br/></p>
<p>  </p>


<p>Question 71 <br/>Answer: 4 <br/>Option (4) is correct and Options (1), (2), and (3) are incorrect because each strata lot, together with the strata lot <br/>owner&#8217;s share in the common property, is deemed to be a separate parcel of land and is assessed and taxed <br/>individually. <br/></p>

<p>Question 73 <br/>Answer: 1 <br/>Option (1) is correct because product positioning refers to the position a product or service holds within the <br/>minds of its consumers. Options (2), (3), and (4) are incorrect for this reason. <br/></p>
<p>Question 74 <br/>Answer: 2 <br/>Find the market value using the cost method of appraisal. <br/> <br/>Site Value: $900,000 <br/>+ Cost of Improvements = $48 &#61512; 50,000 = $2,400,000 <br/>&#61473; Depreciation $2,400,000 &#61512; 0.10 = $240,000 <br/>  <br/>Market value = $900,000 + $2,400,000 &#61473; $240,000 = $3,060,000 <br/></p>
<p>Question 75 <br/>Answer: 1 <br/>Option (1) is correct because depreciation expense cannot be deducted from taxable income. Instead, the <br/>Income Tax Act permits a capital cost allowance deduction from taxable income. Option (2) is therefore <br/>incorrect. Option (3) is incorrect because taxable income is used to calculate income taxes payable. Option (4) is <br/>incorrect because any declared dividends are important for taxation, as corporations receive special tax <br/>treatment for declaring and paying cash dividends. </p>


<p>Question 76 <br/>Answer: 4 <br/>Option (4) is correct because the owners of Green Acres, as &#8220;occupiers&#8221;, owe a duty to take reasonable care to <br/>ensure that persons entering their property will be reasonably safe. Despite being away on vacation, the owners <br/>of Green Acres are &#8220;occupiers&#8221; for the purposes of the Occupiers Liability Act because they maintain <br/>responsibility for, and control over, their property even while physically absent. Ensuring the safety of persons <br/>entering onto their property may have required the owners of Green Acres to take steps to address the hazard <br/>posed by the old, overhanging tree branch. If this is the case, the owners will be liable to Gheeta for her injury. <br/>Option (1) is incorrect because the risk of the tree hurting someone who comes onto the property only needs to <br/>be reasonably foreseeable, not known by the owners of Green Acres. Option (2) is incorrect because it is <br/>irrelevant whether the owners of Green Acres were home or not at the time of the injury. Option (3) is incorrect <br/>because Gheeta was injured on Green Acres and those who fall under the definition of an &#8220;occupier&#8221; of Green <br/>Acres under the Occupiers Liability Act, such as the owners of Green Acres, may also be liable to Gheeta for <br/>damages. <br/></p>
<p>Question 77 <br/>Answer: 2 <br/>Option (2) is correct because if a bidder&#8217;s ceiling price is $30,500, then this is the highest he will bid &#8212; he&#8217;s hit <br/>the ceiling. If an owner&#8217;s floor price is $32,500, then this is the lowest the owner will go. Therefore, a sale cannot <br/>take place because there is no price the bidder is willing pay that the owner will accept. Option (1) is incorrect <br/>because the ceiling and floor prices are the highest and lowest that the parties will go, respectively. A sale price <br/>cannot be negotiated outside of each party&#8217;s price range. Option (3) is incorrect for this reason. Option (4) is <br/>incorrect because there is no indication that the parties are behaving unreasonably.   <br/></p>
<p>Question 78 <br/>Answer: 4 <br/>Option (4) is correct because a misrepresentation is not required to be in writing. Options (1), (2), and (3) are <br/>incorrect because the requirements to establish misrepresentation in contract law are that it must be an <br/>assertion of fact, it must be false, and it must have been material to the formation of the contract (i.e., it must <br/>have reasonably induced the other party to enter into the contract). <br/></p>
<p>Question 79 <br/>Answer: 2 <br/>Option (2) is correct because a website that is not compatible with mobile devices may be penalized in search <br/>engine results that originate from mobile devices. Option (1) is incorrect because SEO refers to how easily a <br/>website can be found in unpaid (NOT paid) search results. Option (3) is incorrect because SEO stands for Search <br/>Engine Optimization. Since Options (1) and (3) are false, Option (4) is incorrect. <br/></p>
<p>Question 80 <br/>Answer: 4 <br/>Option (4) is correct because Avon would not be liable in any of the previous scenarios. Option (1) is incorrect <br/>because it is an example of ameliorating waste. Avon is not liable for ameliorating waste because his life <br/>tenancy has been granted &#8220;without impeachment for waste.&#8221; Option (2) is also incorrect for this reason, as it is <br/>an example of permissive waste. Option (3) is incorrect because it is an example of voluntary waste. </p>


<p>Question 81 <br/>Answer: 2 <br/>Option (2) is correct because the principal of substitution in the comparative approach of appraisal states that a <br/>property&#8217;s value should not exceed the cost of purchasing an alternate property that can provide similar utility. <br/>Therefore, similar properties that have recently sold are comparable. Option (1) is incorrect because the value <br/>to owner is highly subjective and likely differs from market value. Option (3) is incorrect because it is <br/>impossible to find identical properties; however, it is usually possible to find lots with enough common <br/>characteristics to regard them as similar for the purpose of appraisal. Option (4) is incorrect because it describes <br/>the cost approach, not the comparative approach of appraisal.  <br/></p>
<p>Question 82 <br/>Answer: 1 <br/>Option (1) is correct because each strata lot gets one vote. If two or more persons share one vote because they <br/>own the strata lot together, only one of them may vote on a given matter. Option (2) is incorrect because votes <br/>are allocated one per strata lot, not by unit entitlement. Option (3) is incorrect because votes are allocated one <br/>per strata lot, not by individual owner. Option (4) is incorrect because the strata lot is entitled to one vote, <br/>regardless of the type of resolution being made. <br/></p>
<p>Question 83 <br/>Answer: 1 <br/>Option (1) is correct because it is an example of frustration, rather than a breach of contract. Option (2) is <br/>incorrect because it is an example of a breach of contract. After the contract was agreed to, Quin did not fulfil <br/>his promise under the contract. Option (3) is incorrect because after the contract was agreed to, Fred did not <br/>fulfil his promise under the contract. Option (4) is incorrect because after the contract was agreed to, Adrian did <br/>not fulfil his promise under the contract. <br/></p>
<p>Question 84 <br/>Answer: 2 <br/>Option (2) is correct because interest paid on a mortgage is not considered an operating expense. Options (1), <br/>(3), and (4) are incorrect because these are all included in operating expenses, which are paid by the landlord.  <br/></p>
<p>Question 85 <br/>Answer: 3 <br/>Option (3) is correct because a fixed term tenancy cannot be terminated by the landlord before the end of the <br/>fixed term (i.e., December 31). The earliest that Bing can require Diana to leave is December 31, by serving <br/>Diana with a Two Month Notice to End Tenancy for Landlord&#8217;s Use of Property on October 31. Options (1), (2), <br/>and (4) are incorrect for this reason.  <br/></p>
<p>Question 86 <br/>Answer: 3 <br/>Option (3) is correct because an appraiser will not be able to obtain the buyer&#8217;s expected rent and expense <br/>forecasts, as this is not publicly-accessible data. Options (1), (2), and (4) are incorrect because an appraiser <br/>valuing a commercial property can obtain documents, filings, and market data outlining things such as current <br/>lease conditions at the time of sale of the property, the amount of any registered mortgages, and the physical <br/>characteristics of the building. </p>


<p>Question 87 <br/>Answer: 3 <br/>Option (3) is correct because a board of variance is a local government board that determines whether a zoning <br/>bylaw creates undue hardships on property owners. It can grant a minor variance, provided it does not conflict <br/>with the local government&#8217;s policies. Option (1) is incorrect because a board of variance is not a provincial <br/>board. Option (2) is incorrect because a board of variance does not have the power to amend property <br/>assessments. Option (4) is incorrect because while a board of variance may grant minor variances to zoning <br/>bylaws, it does not settle property line disputes between private parties.  <br/></p>
<p>Question 88 <br/>Answer: 3 <br/>Find his monthly principal and interest payment given Jeff&#8217;s income, taxes, and his gross debt service ratio of <br/>30%. <br/></p>
<p>P + I + $200 = 0.30<br/>$3,000<br/></p>
<p>  <br/></p>
<p>P + I = ($3,000&#215;0.30)-$200 = $700   <br/></p>
<p>Question 89 <br/>Answer: 2 <br/>Option (2) is correct because real estate as a product is generally unique and complex, requiring expert skills <br/>and knowledge for an accurate appraisal. Option (1) is incorrect because no license is required to conduct an <br/>appraisal. Option (3) is incorrect because real estate is unique, and therefore cannot be classified as a <br/>homogenous commodity. Option (4) is incorrect because the low turnover of real estate makes it difficult to <br/>collect information regarding recent sales. <br/></p>
<p>Question 90 <br/>Answer: 4 <br/>Option (4) is false and is therefore the correct answer. The unity of interest requires that all joint tenants have <br/>the same estate or interest in land; the extent, nature, and duration must be identical. Option (1) is incorrect in <br/>certain scenarios, a joint tenancy can be severed by one of the joint tenants even if the other joint tenant(s) is <br/>unaware of the action of the joint tenant severing the joint tenancy. Option (2) is incorrect because in a joint <br/>tenancy, the co-owners each have an undivided share in the property. By definition, joint tenants are co-owners <br/>of the same interest, whatever that interest may be. Finally, Option (3) is incorrect because a defining feature of <br/>joint tenancy is the right of survivorship. This means that when one joint tenant dies, that joint tenant&#8217;s estate <br/>automatically vests in the surviving joint tenant(s). <br/></p>
<p>Question 91 <br/>Answer: 3 <br/>Option (3) is correct because central, gas-fired, forced air heating systems require ductwork under the floor, <br/>which makes it difficult and expensive to install after the house is already built. Options (1) and (2) are incorrect <br/>because these types of heating systems are advantageous in that they also provide air filtration and have a fast <br/>response time to temperature changes. Option (4) is incorrect because these types of heating systems transmit <br/>heat through convection. </p>


<p>Question 92 <br/>Answer: 2 <br/>Option (2) is correct because it is true. Option (1) is false because a listing contract is a specialized form of <br/>agency contract. It is a contract between the seller and a real estate brokerage. The brokerage promises to try to <br/>find a buyer and the seller promises to pay a stated amount of commission if the brokerage is successful. Option <br/>(2) is true. Designated Agency eliminates the conflict that previously arose when two licensees in the same <br/>brokerage represented both the seller and the buyer in a transaction. Option (3) is false because real estate <br/>brokerages can work on behalf of a seller or a buyer on a real estate transaction. Option (4) is false because an <br/>agent&#8217;s authority to bind his or her principal can arise: (1) expressly; (2) by implication; (3) as a result of the <br/>doctrine of estoppel; or, (4) by ratification by the principal of the agent&#8217;s acts done on the principal&#8217;s behalf. <br/></p>
<p>Question 93 <br/>Answer: 1 <br/>Option (1) is correct and Option (2) is incorrect because under section 59 of the Law and Equity Act, a contract <br/>for the sale of land must generally be in writing and signed by all parties to the contract. Option (3) is incorrect <br/>because an amendment to a contract of purchase and sale will state that it does not terminate the existing <br/>contract. Option (4) is incorrect because if a change is made to the contract of purchase and sale before the <br/>buyer&#8217;s offer is accepted, then there is no contract of purchase and sale. It is simply an amendment to the offer <br/>(i.e., a counter-offer). <br/></p>
<p>Question 94 <br/>Answer: 4 <br/>Option 4 is correct. $175,000 is the face value, the amount that the contract is written for. However, there are <br/>legal fees, commissions, and appraisal fees that are deducted; therefore, the actual amount that is applied to the <br/>loan is $171,000 (present value). <br/> <br/>Press Display <br/>12 &#61568; P/YR  12 <br/>171000 PV 171,000 <br/>1103.21 +/&#61473; PMT &#61473;1,103.21 <br/>240 N  240 <br/>0 FV  0 <br/>I/YR  4.73037 <br/>&#61568; EFF%  4.834288 <br/></p>
<p>Question 95 <br/>Answer: 2  <br/>Option (2) is correct because the lender&#8217;s knowledge that the property has been sold will not relieve the <br/>borrower from liability on his or her personal covenant. Options (1), (3), and (4) are incorrect because these <br/>events will relieve the borrower from this liability. <br/></p>
<p>Question 96 <br/>Answer: 4  <br/>Option (4) is correct because when taxes are previously paid by the seller, the buyer should reimburse the seller <br/>for the portion of the year from the adjustment date onward. The reimbursement will appear as a credit on the <br/>seller&#8217;s statement and a debit on the buyer&#8217;s statement. Patty&#8217;s share of the year&#8217;s property taxes (Nov. 14 B Dec. <br/>31 = 48 days) is calculated in the following manner: 48/365 &#215; $896 = $117.83. Options (1), (2), and (3) are <br/>therefore incorrect. </p>


<p>Question 97 <br/>Answer: 3  <br/>Option (3) is correct because when a new loan is received by the buyer from a mortgage company or third party, <br/>the amount appears only as a credit on the buyer&#8217;s statement of adjustments, as a new loan does not affect the <br/>seller&#8217;s cash proceeds of sale. The $65,000 loan will only appear on Pedro&#8217;s statement, as a credit. Options (1), <br/>(2), and (4) are therefore incorrect.  <br/></p>
<p>Question 98 <br/>Answer: 1 <br/> <b>Buyer&#8217;s Statement of Adjustments (Pamela)</b> <br/><b>ITEM   DEBIT  CREDIT <br/></b>Purchase Price 75,900.00  <br/>Deposit to Lawyer*   <b>2,000.00</b> <br/>Ring   7,500.00 <br/>1st Mortgage  65,000.00 <br/>Buyer's Share of Taxes**     <b>117.83</b>  <br/>Lawyer's Fee   600.00  <br/>Property Transfer Tax   759.00  <br/>Balance Due to Complete*** ________ <b> 2,876.83</b> <br/> 77,376.83 77,376.83 <br/>* Since the deposit is being paid to the lawyer in trust, the amount will not appear on the Seller's statement of adjustments. <br/>** (Nov. 14-Dec. 31 = 48 days) 48/365 &#61512; $896 = $117.83  <br/>***  Because the total Debits and Credits must balance, in order to find the Balance Due to Complete, you must first calculate the <br/> total Debits ($77,376.83) and then subtract the known Credits. The result is the balance due from the buyer to complete the <br/>transaction. <br/></p>
<p>Question 99 <br/>Answer: 2  <br/>Option (2) is correct because the real estate commission is payable by Valerie and would appear as a debit only <br/>on her statement. Options (1), (3), and (4) are incorrect as it does not affect Phil&#8217;s balance due to complete. <br/></p>
<p>Question 100 <br/>Answer: 2 <br/>Option (2) is correct and Options (1), (3), and (4) are incorrect because the only way a victim of a fraudulent <br/>conveyance of his or her land will lose the right to have the transfer set aside is when the title to the property <br/>has been transferred to a good faith purchaser for valuable consideration. <br/></p>
<p>Question 101 <br/>Answer: 4 <br/>Option (4) is correct because it is true. Option (1) is incorrect because the turnover rate for real property is low, <br/>meaning there are limited data sources and information available upon which to base an opinion of an value. <br/>Option (2) is incorrect because every parcel of real property is distinct, unique, and heterogenous, meaning <br/>property values cannot be easily standardized or generalized. Option (3) is incorrect because real property is <br/>durable and long-lasting, meaning it may not be quick to respond to market pressures. </p>


<p>Question 102 <br/>Answer: 2 <br/>Option (2) is correct because these powers have been assigned to the provincial government under the <br/>Constitution Act, 1867. Options (1), (3), and (4) are incorrect because these have been assigned to the federal <br/>government under the Constitution Act, 1867. <br/></p>
<p>Question 103 <br/>Answer: 3 <br/>Option (3) is correct because the British Columbia Financial Services Authority (&#8220;BCFSA&#8221;) cannot suspend the <br/>licensee from participation in the Multiple Listing Service (MLS) following a disciplinary hearing. Only a local <br/>real estate board can suspend a licensee from participation in the MLS. Options (1), (2), and (4) are all examples <br/>of actions that BCFSA can take following a disciplinary hearing, under section 43 of the Real Estate Services Act. <br/></p>
<p>Question 104 <br/>Answer: 2 <br/>Option (2) is correct because in order to qualify for a managing broker&#8217;s licence in British Columbia, an <br/>applicant must have been providing real estate services as a licensee for at least two years during the five years <br/>before the date of the application in British Columbia, or in an equivalent jurisdiction. Option (1) is incorrect <br/>because to qualify for a managing broker&#8217;s licence, a person is not required to submit personal financial <br/>statements of each licensee they intend to hire. Option (3) is incorrect because to qualify for a managing <br/>broker&#8217;s licence in British Columbia, a person is required to have at least two years&#8217; experience in a Canadian <br/>province or Yukon. Option (4) is incorrect because a minimum of 19 years of age is required. <br/></p>

<p>Question 106 <br/>Answer: 1 <br/>Option (1) is correct because a builders lien must be filed within 45 days after the project is substantially <br/>completed, ended, or abandoned. Option (2) is incorrect because liens may still be filed after ownership of a </p>


<p>property is transferred, and the buyer may potentially be liable for any builders liens that are filed even after <br/>the completion of their purchase. Option (3) is incorrect because both general contractors, and subcontractors <br/>who were not paid by a general contractor, may file builders liens. Option (4) is incorrect because the Builders <br/>Lien Act requires owners to hold back 10% of the price they are required to pay under the contract. The 7% <br/>holdback applies only when individuals are purchasing strata lots from an owner developer, and where <br/>applicable, the 7% applies to the gross purchase price.    <br/></p>
<p>Question 107 <br/>Answer: 4 <br/>Option (4) is correct because all of the options are examples of trespass. Trespass consists of wrongfully <br/>entering, remaining on, or placing something on another&#8217;s land. Trespass requires both a voluntary and a <br/>direct action. Option (1) is an example of trespass because even though entering the other property was a <br/>mistake, it was still intentional since the person had control over where they were walking. Option (2) is an <br/>example of trespass because deliberately crossing another person&#8217;s property is both voluntary and direct. <br/>Option (3) is an example of trespass because even though the person did not personally step on another <br/>person&#8217;s land, they intentionally threw the item. The item ended up on the other person&#8217;s property as a result of <br/>the direct act of the trespasser. <br/></p>
<p>Question 108 <br/>Answer: 1 <br/>Option (1) is correct because a lease is an estate in land, while a license is a contractual right that contains no <br/>estate in land. Option (2) is incorrect because a contract for a license may be in writing. Option (3) is incorrect <br/>because the terminology is not the most significant difference between a lease and a license, since they contain <br/>different rights. Option (4) is incorrect because leases provide exclusive possession, while licenses give the <br/>rights described in the license agreement. <br/></p>

<p>Question 110 <br/>Answer: 4 <br/>Option (4) is correct because a corporation is a type of organization that is considered a separate legal and <br/>taxable entity. Options (1), (2), and (3) are incorrect because sole proprietors and all types of partners must <br/>include their business income on their personal income tax returns. </p>


<p>Question 111  <br/>Answer: 4 <br/>Option (4) is correct because prescribing the maximum lot area per dwelling is not a method of measuring <br/>density. Rather, prescribing the minimum lot area per dwelling is a method of measuring density. Options (1), <br/>(2), and (3) are incorrect because total floor area of the building in relation to the size of the lot, floor area ratio, <br/>and number of dwelling units per hectare are all methods of measuring density. <br/></p>
<p>Question 112  <br/>Answer: 2 <br/>Option (2) is correct because the offer can be revoked without warning, as long as the offer has not been <br/>accepted. Option (1) is incorrect because if an offer has a specified time for expiry, it can be revoked prior to the <br/>date of expiry (unless consideration has been given to keep the offer open). Option (3) is incorrect because <br/>revocation cannot be made after the offer has been accepted. Option (4) is incorrect because the method of <br/>revocation does not need to be the same as the method used in the offer. The postal acceptance rule does not <br/>apply to revocation. <br/></p>
<p>Question 113  <br/>Answer: 3 <br/>Option (3) is correct because, if properly drafted, a contract of purchase and sale is a binding contract. Option <br/>(1) is incorrect because a contract of purchase and sale is not a contract to make a contract. Option (2) is <br/>incorrect because a contract of purchase and sale, if properly drafted, is enforceable. Option (4) is incorrect <br/>because a contract of purchase and sale is a contract, not an invitation to treat. <br/></p>
<p>Question 114  <br/>Answer: 4 <br/>Option (4) is correct because the rate of commission payable is not required in a contract of purchase and sale; <br/>rather, it is included in a listing contract. Options (1), (2), and (3) are incorrect because parties, property and <br/>price must be included in a contract of purchase and sale. <br/></p>
<p>Question 115  <br/>Answer: 4 <br/>Option (4) is correct because it is false. An agent can be held liable to a third party for fraudulent statements, <br/>regardless of whether their principal knew or authorized the actions. Option (1) is incorrect because a principal <br/>is liable both for the actions taken by his or her agent and when they expressly authorize a fraudulent act. <br/>Option (2) is incorrect because an agent is personally liable to a third party when the agent has knowingly made <br/>false representations. Option (3) is incorrect because an agent cannot escape personal liability for fraud on the <br/>basis that the agent was authorized by the principal to commit it. <br/></p>
<p>Question 116  <br/>Answer: 3 <br/>Option (3) is correct because assumed authority is not one of the forms of authority that allows an agent to enter <br/>into a contract on behalf of their principal. Option (1), (2), and (4) are incorrect because implied authority, <br/>apparent authority, and express authority all allow the agent to enter into a contract.  <br/></p>
<p>Question 117 <br/>Answer: 2 <br/>Option (2) is correct because mortgages require a high degree of initial administrative work such as writing <br/>contracts and registering a charge on the property, as well as subsequent administration of payments, <br/>outstanding balance, and refinancing. Option (1) is incorrect because each mortgage is a unique investment <br/>and is difficult to trade. Option (3) is incorrect because mortgage investments require a large capital outlay. </p>


<p>Option (4) is incorrect because mortgages typically have long repayment terms, which make it difficult for the <br/>investor to reinvest the periodic payments at a good rate. <br/></p>

<p>Question 121 <br/>Answer: 3 <br/>Option (3) is correct because a mortgagor (i.e., a borrower) who grants a mortgage of real property to a lender <br/>retains an interest described as &#8220;the equity of redemption&#8221;. The equity of redemption protects the borrower&#8217;s <br/>right to redeem the property upon payment of the mortgage. Option (1) is incorrect because a right of <br/>foreclosure arises in favour of a lender where the borrower defaults on the mortgage. Option (2) is incorrect <br/>because a mortgage at common law was a conveyance of both title to land and the possession of the land to a <br/>lender, not a right retained by the borrower. Option (4) is incorrect because an equitable mortgage refers to a <br/>mortgage which is not (and perhaps cannot be) registered on title as a legal mortgage. </p>


<p>Question 122 <br/>Answer: 2 <br/>Option (2) is correct because a mortgage that is granted, but for procedural reasons is not registrable, is <br/>recognized as an equitable mortgage. Option (1) is ncorrect because this type of mortgage is an equitable <br/>mortgage, and is enforceable.  Option (3) is incorrect because while a lender should file a caveat to protect its <br/>position until the mortgage is in proper registrable form and registered on title, a caveat is not the only <br/>protection for an equitable mortgage.  An equitable mortgage can also be protected by handing over to the <br/>lender the duplicate certificate of title as security for the loan.  Option (4) is incorrect because this is an <br/>equitable mortgage, not a legal mortgage. <br/></p>
<p>Question 123 <br/>Answer: 4 <br/>Find the payment and outstanding balance according to the loan contract, then value these amounts at the <br/>market rate. Add the cash down payment to obtain the market value of the offer.

<p>Question 125 <br/>Answer: 4 <br/>Option (4) is correct because the federal government has exclusive jurisdiction with respect to the development <br/>and operation of airports. Options (1), (2), and (3) are incorrect because land use zoning, subdivision regulation, <br/>and building regulations are all regulated by local government.  <br/></p>
<p>Question 126 <br/>Answer: 3 <br/>Option (3) is correct because an assessment notice is a notice informing a property owner of the value of the <br/>property as of July 1 of the previous year. Option (1) is incorrect because a separate statement called a &#8220;tax <br/>notice&#8221; is sent to property owners requesting payment of taxes. Option (2) is incorrect because notice is not <br/>issued prior to an appraisal. Option (4) is incorrect because an assessment notice does not deal with costs of <br/>local improvement projects to property owners. <br/></p>
<p>Question 127 <br/>Answer: 2 <br/>Option (2) is correct because zinc strips discourage moss growth on a roof. When it rains, the rain carries tiny <br/>amounts of zinc down the slope of the roof, which prevents moss from growing in this otherwise damp location. <br/>Options (1), (3), and (4) are incorrect as they do not describe the purpose of a zinc strip. </p>


<p>Question 128 <br/>Answer: 4 <br/>Option (4) is correct because it is false. The appraiser must understand the client&#8217;s intended use in order to <br/>make the appropriate scope of work decision. Option (1) is incorrect because appraisers do not rely on the <br/>client; they use their experience and judgment to establish the information necessary to identify and resolve the <br/>problem. Option (2) is incorrect because the appraiser determines the scope of work and level of information <br/>necessary to produce a credible appraisal. Option (3) is incorrect because limited detail may be acceptable if it <br/>falls within the requested scope of work and limitations are indicated in the report.  <br/></p>
<p>Question 129 <br/>Answer: 2 <br/>Option (2) is correct because the comparative approach is based on the principle of substitution, which asserts <br/>that a property&#8217;s value should be no more than the cost of purchasing a substitute property that provides <br/>similar utility. Options (1), (3), and (4) are incorrect as they do not form the basis of the comparative approach of <br/>appraisal. <br/></p>
<p>Question 130 <br/>Answer: 3 <br/>Option (3) is correct because when using a rating grid, the subject property is the standard of comparison and <br/>each comparable sale is adjusted to it. The subject property is not adjusted to the comparables nor are the <br/>comparables adjusted to each other. Option (1) is incorrect because the correct approach is to determine which <br/>comparable is most like the subject property and use that as main evidence for the final market value, not to <br/>average the value of the comparable sale prices. Option (2) is incorrect because the comparable properties need <br/>not have the same lot size as the subject property. Option (4) is incorrect because the comparable properties do <br/>not require the same cost of improvements as the subject property.  <br/></p>
<p>Question 131 <br/>Answer: 2 <br/>Option (2) is correct because a wood burning furnace as a property&#8217;s primary heating system is an example of <br/>functional curable depreciation, which is an outdated feature that can be corrected economically. Options (1), <br/>(3), and (4) are incorrect for this reason.  <br/></p>

<p>Question 133 <br/>Answer: 3 <br/>Option (3) is correct because legal Fees for conveyance are classified under the &#8220;debit&#8221; of the purchaser, and <br/>legal Fees to discharge an existing mortgage on title is under &#8220;debit&#8221; of the vendor. Options (1), (2), and (4) are <br/>incorrect for this reason. </p>


<p>Question 134 <br/>Answer: 4 <br/>Option (4) is correct because the marketing mix consists of product, place, price, and promotion. Options (1), <br/>(2), and (3) are incorrect for this reason. <br/></p>
<p>Question 135 <br/>Answer: 2 <br/>Option (2) is correct because an owner developer creates a strata development by filing a strata plan with the <br/>land title office. On the strata plan, the entirety of the building is divided between strata lots and common <br/>property. Option (1) is incorrect because a strata plan does not contain the developer&#8217;s goals nor does it form <br/>part of the disclosure statement. Option (3) is incorrect because cooperative owners possess shares in a <br/>non-profit corporation, which in turn holds title to the land. Therefore, there is no need to file a strata plan to <br/>divide the property into individual units. Option (4) is incorrect because a strata plan must be filed for any <br/>strata development regardless of the number of lots being created. <br/></p>
<p>Question 136 <br/>Answer: 4 <br/>Option (4) is correct because Options (1), (2), and (3) all describe situations in which a lender who is foreclosing <br/>may ask the court to appoint a receiver. If a mortgaged property has been abandoned (as described in Option <br/>(3)) or contains a commercial operation (as described in Options (1) and (2)), the lender may request that the <br/>court appoint a receiver to collect the rents, pay the bills, and generally keep the business going.  <br/></p>
<p>Question 137 <br/>Answer: 4 <br/>Option (4) is correct because an appraisal values the legal rights of ownership vested in a particular piece of real <br/>estate. Options (1), (2), and (3) are incorrect as they do not describe the subject of an appraisal.  <br/></p>
<p>Question 138 <br/>Answer: 3 <br/>Option (3) is correct because a private nuisance occurs when an owner or occupier of land unreasonably and <br/>substantially interferes with the reasonable use and enjoyment of a neighbouring property. Option (1) is <br/>incorrect because private nuisance is concerned with the use and enjoyment of property, not the safety or <br/>comfort of the public at large. Option (2) is incorrect because an act constituting private nuisance need not <br/>involve a trespass (e.g., the wrongful disturbance of an easement may constitute a private nuisance). Option (4) <br/>is incorrect because Option (3) is correct. <br/></p>
<p>Question 139 <br/>Answer: 4 <br/>Option (4) is correct because it is not mandatory to consider the potential increase in real property tax revenue <br/>to convert a rental building to a condominium. Options (1), (2), and (3) are all factors the approving authority <br/>must consider when deciding whether to approve the conversion. <br/></p>
<p>Question 140 <br/>Answer: 1 <br/>Option (1) is correct because the immobility of land does not affect how a purchase is financed. Options (2), (3), <br/>and (4) are incorrect as they result from the immobility of land. </p>


<p>Question 141 <br/>Answer: 3 <br/>Option (3) is correct because a vaulted ceiling is an architectural variation, not a structural method used in <br/>housing construction. Options (1), (2), and (4) are incorrect because they describe types of structural methods <br/>used in housing construction. <br/></p>
<p>Question 142 <br/>Answer: 4 <br/>Option (4) is correct because the monthly payment on a straight line principal reduction loan declines over <br/>time. Options (2) and (3) are incorrect because each monthly payment includes a constant amount of the <br/>principal, plus the interest that has accrued for the month. Options (1) is incorrect because as the outstanding <br/>balance declines over time, the amount of monthly interest declines; therefore, the total payment declines.  <br/></p>

<p>Question 148 <br/>Answer: 4 <br/>Option (4) is correct because the age of the decision does not determine which decision should govern the <br/>subsequent decision. Options (1), (2), and (3) each describe a component of the doctrine of stare decisis. <br/></p>
<p>Question 149 <br/>Answer: 3 <br/>Option (3) is correct because it is true. Option (1) is incorrect because the net operating income represents a <br/>return on the entire value of the property; it is not a return only on the equity portion of the property&#8217;s value. <br/>Option (2) is incorrect because items specific to an owner or investor are NOT included in the calculation of net <br/>operating income. Option (4) is incorrect because the income approach can be used in appraising most types of <br/>property, although it is more appropriate for properties that produce rental income, e.g., apartment buildings, <br/>office buildings, industrial space. </p>


<p>Question 150 <br/>Answer: 1 <br/>Option (1) is correct. Karen may have a claim for private nuisance against Jack, as the interference was <br/>continuous, the act was done on his land but affected Karen&#8217;s land, and it interfered with Karen&#8217;s use and <br/>enjoyment of her land. An injunction is a possible remedy available under a successful action in private <br/>nuisance. Option (2) is false because, if Karen chooses to sue Jack for negligence, she must prove that he has <br/>breached the standard of care owed to her by a reasonable person in Jack&#8217;s situation, not that he breached the <br/>duty of care. Option (3) is false because the interference with airspace rights of a fee simple owner would likely <br/>be an action in trespass, and in this case, Jack did not trespass, as the act was done on his land. Option (4) is false <br/>because although trespass is actionable per se, Jack did not trespass onto Karen&#8217;s property. Trespass requires <br/>the direct physical invasion of land by a person or tangible object.  <br/></p>
<p>Question 151  <br/>Answer: 4 <br/>Option (4) is correct because the agent has a duty to avoid conflicts of interest with his or her principal, but the <br/>principal does not owe this duty to his or her agent. Options (1), (2), and (3) are incorrect because they are duties <br/>that are owed by a principal to his or her agent. <br/></p>
<p>Question 152 <br/>Answer: 2 <br/>Option (2) is correct because in British Columbia the statutory liability to pay real property taxes is on the <br/>owner of the property. This applies even in the context of long term-leases where the lessor is not a tax exempt <br/>organization or public body. That said, a lease contract can impose on a lessor a contractual liability to pay <br/>property taxes. Option (1), (3), and (4) are incorrect because each of these entities would be statutorily liable for <br/>property taxes. <br/></p>
<p>Question 153 <br/>Answer: 3 <br/>Option (3) is correct because Larry may be able to enforce the lease agreement under section 59 of the Law and <br/>Equity Act since he has spent $10,000 on a new barn. Generally, contracts respecting land in British Columbia <br/>must be in writing to be enforceable, pursuant to section 59 of the Law and Equity Act. However, section 59 <br/>allows an exception to this writing requirement in situations where the person seeking to enforce an unwritten <br/>contract has changed his or her position such that it would be unfair not to enforce the contract. Option (1) is <br/>incorrect because there are exceptions to the writing requirement imposed by section 59. Option (2) is incorrect <br/>because section 59 applies to lease agreements for more than 3 years. Option (4) is incorrect because a lease <br/>agreement is not automatically void if not in writing (e.g., section 59 does not apply to lease agreements for <br/>terms of 3 years or less). <br/></p>
<p>Question 154 <br/>Answer: 2 <br/>Option (2) is correct because a principal will be bound to a third party by the acts of their agent provided those <br/>acts were within the agent&#8217;s authority. This means that a principal could be liable to a third party under a <br/>contract entered into by their agent where the agent failed to disclose their status as an agent, as long as the <br/>agent was acting within their authority. That said, where an agent does not disclose to a third party that he or <br/>she is acting as an agent, the agent may also be held liable as a principal. Options (1), (3), and (4) are incorrect <br/>because each statement is true of the common law of agency. </p>


<p>Question 155 <br/>Answer: 3  <br/>Option (3) is the correct answer as the cost approach is most likely to result in an appraisal value that is <br/>significantly different from the price a property might sell for. The reason for this is because the replacement <br/>cost of a property may not be representative of the value in the market. Options (1), (2), and (4) are incorrect <br/>because these factors would likely be accounted for in the appraised value.  <br/></p>

<p> <br/>Next, calculate the maximum loan by determining the present value of the mortgage based on the above <br/>maximum allowable payments: <br/> <br/>Press Display <br/>5 &#61568; NOM% 5 <br/>2 &#61568; P/YR 2 <br/>&#61568; EFF%  5.0625 <br/>12 &#61568; P/YR 12 <br/>&#61568; NOM%  4.948699 <br/>1566.67 +/&#61473; PMT &#61473;1,566.67 <br/>300 N 300 <br/>0 FV 0 <br/>PV  269,370.11207 <br/>The maximum loan under the GDSR constraint of $269,370.11 is less than the maximum loan of $272,000 <br/>under the loan-to-value constraint; therefore, the maximum allowable loan is the lesser of the two, $269,370, <br/>rounded to the nearest dollar. <br/></p>
<p>Question 158 <br/>Answer: 4 <br/>Option (4) is correct because a multiple listing agreement is a type of exclusive listing contract which requires <br/>that the listing be distributed to all members of the listing licensee&#8217;s real estate board. Option (1) is incorrect <br/>because the term &#8220;multiple&#8221; in &#8220;multiple listing agreement&#8221; does not refer to the number of properties the <br/>brokerage lists for the same seller. Options (2) and (3) are incorrect because a multiple listing contract is always <br/>an exclusive right to sell, meaning that the property is listed with only one brokerage and the seller pays one <br/>commission to that brokerage.  </p>


<p>Question 159 <br/>Answer: 3 <br/>Option (3) is correct because the matching principle states that expenses must be recorded when they are <br/>incurred, not when they are paid. Option (1) is incorrect because the cost principle states that assets must be <br/>recorded for the purchase price on the date of acquisition. Option (2) is incorrect because the recognition <br/>principle is not an accounting principle, although the revenue recognition principle states that revenues must <br/>be recorded when they are earned, not when money is received. Option (4) is incorrect because the <br/>conservation principle is not a generally accepted accounting principle. <br/></p>
<p>Question 160 <br/>Answer: 4 <br/>Option (4) is incorrect because a longer amortization period will mean that repayment is spread out over a <br/>longer period of time, and payments will be smaller. Options (1) is incorrect for this reason. Option (2) is <br/>incorrect because the size of the required payment will be smaller. Option (3) is incorrect because extending the <br/>loan amortization period does not affect its classification. <br/></p>
<p>Question 161 <br/>Answer: 1 <br/>Option (1) is correct because digital signatures are codes that are used to authenticate the individual sending <br/>the message so as to ensure the integrity of the data. To be effective, digital/e-signatures, such as those used in <br/>credit cards, must be unforgeable. Options (2), (3), and (4) are incorrect as they do not describe digital <br/>signatures. <br/></p>
<p>Question 162 <br/>Answer: 2 <br/>Find the loan-to-value ratio based on the property&#8217;s lending value and the amount of the mortgage. <br/> <br/>$84,000 &#247; $120,000 = 70% <br/></p>
<p>Question 163 <br/>Answer: 3 <br/>Option (3) is correct because the commission is paid by the seller only. Therefore, it appears as a debit on the <br/>seller&#8217;s statement of adjustments and does not appear on the buyer&#8217;s statement. Options (1), (2), and (4) are <br/>incorrect for the same reason. <br/></p>
<p>Question 164 <br/>Answer: 4 <br/>Option (4) is correct because tax law falls within the sphere of public law, and is therefore a false statement. <br/>Option (1) is incorrect because the doctrine of stare decisis provides uniformity to the common law system by <br/>requiring courts to adhere to principles that prior courts have established. Option (2) is incorrect because the <br/>Supreme Court of Canada can decide not to hear an appeal. Option (3) is incorrect because courts in Canada <br/>can apply both common law and equitable principles in deciding a matter. <br/></p>
<p>Question 165 <br/>Answer: 1 <br/>Option (1) is correct because a property possesses latent value if its current state does not represent its highest <br/>and best use. Given this, the latent value of the property may be realized through a change of use. Option (2) is <br/>incorrect because a renovation for continued similar use would not realize the property&#8217;s latent value. Option <br/>(3) is incorrect because a property may possess latent value given its current zoning. Further, rezoning may not <br/>be possible. Option (4) is incorrect because a property may be sold at a higher price if it possesses latent value.  </p>

<p>Question 167 <br/>Answer: 4 <br/>Option (4) is correct because rectification is not a remedy for breach of contract. Options (1), (2), and (3) are <br/>incorrect because these are all remedies for breach of contract.  <br/></p>
<p>Question 168 <br/>Answer: 1 <br/>Option (1) is correct because a dormer is a roof extension that provides extra floor area and windows for the <br/>upper level of a home. Options (2), (3), and (4) are incorrect for this reason. <br/></p>
<p>Question 169 <br/>Answer: 3 <br/>Option (3) is correct and Options (1), (2), and (4) are incorrect because the right of survivorship means that <br/>when one joint tenant dies, the entire estate automatically vests in the surviving joint tenants. <br/></p>
<p>Question 170 <br/>Answer: 3 <br/>Option (3) is correct because an unreasonable and substantial interference with property is required to <br/>establish a claim in nuisance. Trifling and inconsequential damages is insufficient. Option (1) is incorrect <br/>because it is no defence to say that the act complained of is beneficial to the public. Option (2) is incorrect <br/>because the fact that the activity creating the nuisance has not been performed in a negligent way is no defence <br/>to an action in nuisance. Option (4) is incorrect because the mere fact that the activity is authorized by statute <br/>does not mean the activity is not a nuisance. </p>

<p> <br/>With an interest only loan, all periodic payments until the end of the term of the loan are interest payments and <br/>are identical. Brad will make monthly interest only payments of $666.67. <br/></p>
<p>Question 172 <br/>Answer: 3 <br/>Option (3) is correct: this password is longer than 8 characters, includes a variety of character types, is not a <br/>dictionary word (or combination of dictionary words), and does not include a combination of consecutive <br/>keyboard keys. Option (1) is incorrect because it is a sequence of consecutive keyboard combinations. Option (2) <br/>incorrect because it is too short. Option (4) is incorrect because it is a combination of dictionary words with an <br/>obvious symbol to replace a letter, which can easily be cracked. <br/></p>
<p>Question 173 <br/>Answer: 2  <br/>Option (2) is correct because individual borrowers have the right, under the terms of the Interest Act, to prepay <br/>all of the outstanding debt (with additional three months&#8217; interest as a penalty in lieu of notice) at any time after <br/>five years from the initiation date of the mortgage. In some instances, mortgage contracts allow for partial or <br/>complete prepayment to occur at any point in the contractual term. Options (1), (3), and (4) are incorrect <br/>because they do not describe prepayment in a mortgage. <br/></p>
<p>Question 174 <br/>Answer: 2 <br/>Option (2) is correct. An appraiser who is asked to find the market value of a newly-constructed church would <br/>not be able to use the comparative or investment approaches due to the lack of data and would be justified in <br/>relying upon the cost approach. In addition, the appraiser can effectively determine the cost of constructing the <br/>improvements since the church is newly constructed and has not experienced any depreciation. Option (1) is <br/>incorrect because a 40-year old bungalow should be appraised using the direct comparison approach, Option <br/>(3) is incorrect because a vacant lot with latent value should be appraised using the residual method. Option (4) <br/>is incorrect because a high rise office tower in an outer suburb should be appraised using the income approach.  </p>


<p>Question 175 <br/>Answer: 2 <br/>Option (2) is correct because a profit &#224; prendre is a right to enter onto the land of another person and to take <br/>some profit from the land, such as profits from fishing. Options (1) and (3) are incorrect because unlike <br/>easements, profits &#224; prendre need not accompany a dominant tenement. They also need not be granted for an <br/>indefinite period of time. Option (4) is incorrect because an owner who wishes to impose restrictions consistent <br/>with a general scheme of development would likely charge the land with a building scheme. <br/></p>
<p>Question 176 <br/>Answer: 3 <br/>Option (3) is correct because a periodic tenancy automatically renews itself on the last day of the term for a <br/>further term of the same duration until terminated by either party. Options (1), (2), and (4) are incorrect because <br/>these statements do not describe features of periodic tenancies. <br/></p>
<p>Question 177 <br/>Answer: 3 <br/>Option (3) is correct because oil left in the storage tank is an item usually settled between the parties outside of <br/>the statements of adjustments. Options (1), (2), and (4) are incorrect for the same reason. <br/></p>
<p>Question 178 <br/>Answer: 1 <br/>Option (1) is correct because rationing mortgage funds means to reduce the amount given out to mortgage <br/>loans. By reducing the gross debt service ratio (PIT/Gross Income), the lender decreases the amount of the loan <br/>for a given gross income. Option (2) is incorrect because decreasing their interest rates doesn&#8217;t decrease the <br/>amount lent out; it just creates a greater demand for loans. Option (3) is incorrect because increasing the <br/>maximum loan to-value ratio means for a given market value of the property, the lender is willing to advance a <br/>greater amount of a loan. Option (4) is incorrect because increasing the maximum amortization period, all <br/>other factors constant, means the present value of the loans will decrease, since borrowers are given more time <br/>to pay off the loan. <br/></p>
<p>Question 179 <br/>Answer: 1 <br/>Option (1) is correct because if the payment is rounded up to the next higher cent, the final payment of a fully <br/>amortized mortgage will be smaller than regular payments, because the borrower is &#8220;overpaying&#8221; a slight <br/>amount each period. Options (2), (3), and (4) are incorrect for this reason. <br/></p>
<p>Question 180 <br/>Answer: 4  <br/>Option (4) is correct because a brokerage is not permitted to withdraw money from the trust account to pay <br/>business expenses. Options (1), (2), and (3) are incorrect because the Real Estate Services Act allows a brokerage <br/>to withdraw money from the trust account in those circumstances. <br/></p>
<p>Question 181 <br/>Answer: 1 <br/>Option (1) is correct because in relation to the subject property, this comparable has three bathrooms (one less <br/>bathroom) and 2,800 square feet. The square footage adjustment is -$10,000; therefore, since the square footage <br/>adjustment is $5,000 per 100 square feet, there is a 200 square foot difference between the comparable and the <br/>subject. Since the adjustment is negative, the comparable property is larger (by 200 square feet) than the subject <br/>(2,600 + 200). Options (2), (3), and (4) are therefore incorrect. </p>


<p>Question 182 <br/>Answer: 2 <br/>Option (2) is correct and Options (1), (3), and (4) are incorrect because an option to purchase the property <br/>provided by the borrower to the lender is considered a clog on the equity of redemption, and is void. <br/></p>

Option (3) is incorrect because an equitable charging <br/>order is not an option for petitioners to apply for after the respondent borrower fails to pay the amount due as <br/>required by an order nisi. <br/></p>
<p>Question 185 <br/>Answer: 3 <br/>Option (3) is correct because limiting the power of land developers is not a rationale for government regulation <br/>of land use. Options (1), (2), and (4) are correct because they are all rationales for government regulation of land <br/>use. </p>

<p>Question 187 <br/>Answer: 4 <br/>Option (4) is correct because section 8.2 of the Real Estate Services Act requires licensees to include the standard <br/>assignment terms in the contract of purchase and sale (unless they have been advised otherwise by their client). <br/>If the requirements of section 8.2 are met, assignments are permissible provided that they do not prejudice the <br/>rights of the seller and the contract does not prohibit assignment. Option (1) is incorrect because contracts of <br/>purchase and sale can only be assigned if certain conditions are met. Option (2) is incorrect because contracts of <br/>purchase and sale can be assigned in some circumstances. Option (3) is incorrect because under the standard <br/>assignment terms, contracts of purchase and sale can be assigned with the written consent of the seller, not the <br/>buyer.  <br/></p>
<p>Question 188 <br/>Answer: 4 <br/>Option (4) is correct because it is false. With an insured mortgage loan, the lender has not only the borrower&#8217;s <br/>personal covenant, but also the insurance as fallback security in the case the borrower defaults on payments. <br/>Options (1), (2), and (3) are true statements and are therefore incorrect. </p>

<p>Question 190 <br/>Answer: 2 <br/>Option (2) is correct because the principal is the person for whom an agent has contracted to act for, and for <br/>whose benefit the agent is required to perform and make decisions. Options (1) and (4) are incorrect because <br/>while an agent may represent a buyer or seller, the question is asking for the general term for the person that an <br/>agent represents, regardless of the side of the transaction. Option (3) is incorrect because &#8220;client&#8221; is not the legal <br/>term for the person whom an agent represents.  <br/></p>
<p>Question 191 <br/>Answer: 4 <br/>Option (4) is correct because depreciation is excluded in net operating income calculations because the life of a <br/>building depends on its economic durability, not its physical durability. The economic life of many buildings is <br/>so long that the amount of depreciation taken each year is not an important element in the estimation of value. <br/>Option (1), (2), and (3) are incorrect because they do not describe reasons for excluding depreciation from net <br/>operating income.  <br/></p>
<p>Question 192 <br/>Answer: 1 <br/>Option (1) is the correct answer. A Property Assessment Review Panel is the first level of appeal from a property <br/>assessment. Option (2) is incorrect because the Board of Variance deals with exceptions to zoning bylaws. <br/>Option (3) is incorrect because the Municipal Finance Authority levies property tax, but does not deal with <br/>assessments. Option (4) is incorrect because the Property Assessment Appeal Board is the second level of appeal <br/>(i.e., it hears appeals from the Property Assessment Review Panel). <br/></p>
<p>Question 193 <br/>Answer: 1 <br/>Option (1) is correct because a restrictive covenant must be negative, not positive.

<p>Question 194 <br/>Answer: 3 <br/>Option (3) is correct because if payments are rounded up to the next higher dollar, the final payment will likely <br/>be smaller because the borrower is &#8220;overpaying&#8221; a small amount each period. Options (1) and (2) are incorrect <br/>because rounding will not increase the cost to the borrower or the yield to the lender. Option (4) is incorrect <br/>because the number of payments will remain the same.  <br/></p>
<p>Question 195 <br/>Answer: 1 <br/>Option (1) is correct because surrender of a commercial lease can arise by operation of law where the landlord <br/>does some act which is inconsistent with the continuation of the tenancy.

Option (2) is incorrect because assets may increase or decrease <br/>depending on the company&#8217;s cash flow and asset purchase/sale activity. Option (3) is incorrect because cash <br/>may increase or decrease depending on the company&#8217;s cash flow activities. Option (4) is incorrect because <br/>liabilities may increase or decrease depending on the company&#8217;s borrowing and repayment activities. <br/></p>
<p>Question 199 <br/>Answer: 3 <br/>Option (3) is correct because assuming John and Mary intend to enter into a legal relationship, the other <br/>essentials of a contract are met &#8211; offer, acceptance, and consideration. There is no evidence that one of the <br/>parties lacks capacity or is lacking genuine consent. Option (1) is incorrect because $500 is valid consideration. <br/>Option (2) is incorrect because the promise to pay is future consideration, not past, as Mary does not yet have <br/>the money. Option (4) is incorrect because the contract is not required to be in writing. </p>


<p>Question 200 <br/>Answer: 3 <br/>Option (3) is correct because a mortgage lender may attract liability for remediation of a contaminated site if <br/>they become the registered owner of the property, for example, as the result of foreclosure. Options (1), (2), and <br/>(4) are incorrect because the Environmental Management Act specifically provides that a lender is not liable if <br/>they participate only in financial matters, impose requirements that will not cause or increase contamination, <br/>or appoint a person to investigate the site. <br/></p>
<p>Question 201 <br/>Answer: 3 <br/>Option (3) is correct because if a contract is executed under seal, the contract will be binding even if no <br/>consideration has been given. Option (1) is incorrect because the contract must also be accepted. Option (2) is <br/>incorrect because the contract may still need to be signed. Option (4) is incorrect because the seal itself does not <br/>show intention, as it is possible that the parties may not know of the legal effects of a seal. <br/></p>
<p>Question 202 <br/>Answer: 1 <br/>Option (1) is correct because increased advertising on a particular property will result in more potential buyers <br/>that may result in a higher sale price. Option (2) is incorrect because Mr. Fisher is providing beneficial <br/>below-market financing that should increase the value of the property and mortgage for sale. Option (3) is <br/>incorrect because Ms. Brown&#8217;s motivation to sell her home quickly would be more likely to result in a quick sale <br/>for a lower price. Option (4) is incorrect because Options (2) and (3) are incorrect. <br/></p>
<p>Question 203 <br/>Answer: 4 <br/>Option (4) is correct because chartered banks accounted for approximately 75% of all resident mortgage credit <br/>outstanding. Options (1), (2), and (3) represent other institutions that are lesser investors in mortgage funds. <br/></p>

Options (1), (2), and (3) are incorrect as they do not describe all of the impacted <br/>lenders. <br/></p>
<p>Question 205 <br/>Answer: 2 <br/>Option (2) is correct because a voidable contract is one which one of the parties has the option to rescind <br/>(meaning cancel) the contract. Option (1) is incorrect because this definition describes a void contract. Option <br/>(3) is incorrect because a voidable contract can still be enforceable. If the party with the option to cancel chooses <br/>not to cancel the contract, they can enforce it against the other party. Option (4) is incorrect because a deed is a <br/>document used to transfer an interest in land, not a contract. </p>

<p>Question 212 <br/>Answer: 2 <br/>Option (2) is correct because both sole proprietors and partners need to report their business income on their <br/>personal income tax returns. Option (1) is incorrect because it excludes partners from this requirement. Option <br/>(3) is incorrect because corporations have different tax liability from proprietors and partners in that <br/>corporations are taxed as separate legal entities. Option (4) is incorrect because a sole proprietorship is a <br/>business enterprise owned by a single individual. <br/></p>
<p>Question 213 <br/>Answer: 4 <br/>Option (4) is correct.

<p>Question 216 <br/>Answer: 3 <br/>Option (3) is correct because section 23 of the Land Title Act contains 10 exceptions to the principle of <br/>indefeasibility. Option (1) is incorrect because neither legal nor equitable charges are guaranteed by the <br/>principle of indefeasibility. Option (2) is incorrect because the principle of indefeasibility only provides that a <br/>good-faith purchaser can rely completely on the ownership shown on the certificate of title, and can acquire <br/>good title upon registration, even though there are defects in the vendor&#8217;s registered title. Option (4) is incorrect <br/>because the principle of indefeasibility overrules the common law doctrine of the void deed. <br/></p>
<p>Question 217 <br/>Answer: 3 <br/>Option (3) is correct because section 7(2) of the Residential Tenancy Act imposes a duty on residential landlords <br/>to mitigate their damages that results from the tenant&#8217;s breach of the tenancy agreement. For example, if a <br/>tenant wrongfully vacates the premises prior to the expiry of a fixed term residential tenancy agreement (as <br/>occurred with Lisa in this question), the landlord must still attempt to re-rent the premises at a reasonably <br/>economic rent. Option (1) is incorrect because section 26(3) of the Residential Tenancy Act effectively abolishes <br/>the remedy of distress in residential tenancies. Option (2) is incorrect because the Residential Tenancy Act does <br/>not limit claims for arrears of rent. The amount claimed for arrears of rent is only limited by the duty to <br/>mitigate damages required of the landlord. Option (4) is incorrect because the Residential Tenancy Act does not <br/>require the landlord to sue the tenant. <br/></p>
<p>Question 218 <br/>Answer: 1 <br/>Option (1) is correct because having references from currently licensed brokers is not a requirement for <br/>obtaining a license under the Real Estate Services Act (RESA).

<p>Question 219 <br/>Answer: 1 <br/>Option (1) is correct because the seller has already paid all of the taxes for the current year and needs to be <br/>refunded the amount proportional to the time that the seller is no longer living in the property. Option (2) is <br/>incorrect because the seller is responsible for the full amount of any penalty. It is not adjusted because only the <br/>seller is liable to pay the taxes and failed to do so in a timely manner. Option (3) is incorrect because the seller <br/>must pay the buyer, in advance of the tax payment, for the portion of the year prior to the adjustment date. <br/></p>
<p>Question 220 <br/>Answer: 3 <br/>Option (3) is correct because current liabilities are only listed on the balance sheet. They would not show up on <br/>the statement of profit and loss, which is also known as the income statement. Options (1), (2), and (4) are <br/>incorrect because the income statement shows revenues and expenses, such as depreciation, rental revenue, <br/>and interest expense on a mortgage.  <br/></p>
<p>Question 221 <br/>Answer: 4 <br/>Option (4) is correct because the final value on a proprietor&#8217;s income statement is the net income. Option (1) is <br/>incorrect because retained earnings is an equity account on a corporation&#8217;s balance sheet. Option (2) is <br/>incorrect because the net income is equal to taxable income, plus depreciation expense, less capital cost <br/>allowance. Option (3) is incorrect because net income is the difference between revenue and expenses for the <br/>year, not revenue and liabilities. </p>


<p>Question 222 <br/>Answer: 4 <br/>Option (4) is correct because an income statement is not always determined on an annual basis. Many large <br/>companies will generate quarterly reports, and sometimes generate reports covering other time periods. <br/>Options (1), (2), and (3) are all true and are therefore incorrect. <br/></p>
<p>Question 223 <br/>Answer: 3 <br/>Option (3) is correct and Options (1), (2), and (4) are incorrect because a notice of civil claim is served to a <br/>defendant who must respond by filing a response to civil claim. <br/></p>

<p>Question 225 <br/>Answer: 2 <br/>Option (2) is correct because the required threshold to submit a Suspicious Transaction Report (STR) to <br/>FINTRAC is reasonable grounds to suspect. Option (1) is incorrect because reasonable grounds to believe means <br/>that there are verified facts supporting a probability that an offence has occurred, and is a higher threshold <br/>than reasonable grounds to suspect. Option (3) is incorrect because it is the standard that needs to be met to <br/>secure a criminal conviction, and it is higher than reasonable grounds to suspect. Option (4) is incorrect <br/>because simple suspicion, described as a &#8220;hunch&#8221; or intuition with little more explanation, is not enough to <br/>meet the threshold requirement for filing an STR. </p>


<p>Question 226 <br/>Answer: 2 <br/>Option (2) is correct and Options (1), (3), (4) are incorrect because each strata lot, together with the strata lot <br/>owner&#8217;s share in the common property, is deemed to be a separate parcel of land and is assessed and taxed <br/>individually. Note that a strata lot owner owns their lot in fee simple and their share of the common property as <br/>a tenant in common with the other owners. <br/></p>

<p>Question 228 <br/>Answer: 1 <br/>Option (1) is correct because the marketing concept involves focusing on the client&#8217;s needs and using need <br/>satisfaction as the starting point for the development of a marketing program. Option (2) is incorrect because <br/>personal selling involves face-to-face communication with a potential customer. Option (3) is incorrect because <br/>the promotional mix refers to the proper blending of components to satisfy the needs of the target market and <br/>to accomplish the desired promotional objectives. Option (4) is incorrect because differentiated marketing <br/>refers to similar products being marketed to different market segments using different marketing techniques. <br/></p>
<p>Question 229 <br/>Answer: 1 <br/>Option (1) is correct because in British Columbia, an infant may act as an agent.

<p>Question 230 <br/>Answer: 4 <br/>Option (4) is correct: if the audience across all social media platforms is the same, then Burris should avoid <br/>posting the exact same message to each different platform. Option (1) is incorrect because there is no precise <br/>number of social media platforms that Burris should use; rather, he should tailor his social media strategy to <br/>ensure he is able to reach his target market through whatever platforms they use. Option (2) is incorrect <br/>because in order to use social media effectively, it will be helpful for Burris to establish goals to ensure his time <br/>is being used productively. Option (3) is incorrect because personal and professional social media accounts <br/>should be kept separate.  <br/></p>
<p>Question 231 <br/>Answer: 2 <br/>First, convert the nominal interest rate with semi-annual compounding (j2 = 4.75%) to the equivalent nominal <br/>interest rate with monthly compounding.

<p>Question 233 <br/>Answer: 2 <br/>Option (2) is correct because even if a person has a right to enter a portion of the premises, if a person wanders <br/>into areas where he or she has no right of entry, then the person becomes a trespasser. Option (1) is incorrect <br/>because Mary was given permission to enter the store, and therefore it is not a trespass.

<p>Question 242 <br/>Answer: 2 <br/>Option (2) is correct because when taxes are previously paid by the seller, the buyer should reimburse the seller <br/>for the portion of the year from the adjustment date onward. The reimbursement will appear as a credit on the <br/>seller&#8217;s statement and a debit on the buyer&#8217;s statement. Options (1), (3), and (4) are incorrect for this reason. </p>

<p>Question 244 <br/>Answer: 1 <br/>Option (1) is correct because when taxes are previously paid by the seller, the buyer should reimburse the seller <br/>for the portion of the year from the adjustment date onward. The buyer&#8217;s share of the year&#8217;s property taxes (Jul. <br/>28 to Dec. 31 = 157 days) is calculated in the following manner: 157/365 &#215; $516 = $221.95. This amount will <br/>appear as a credit on the seller&#8217;s statement and a debit on the buyer&#8217;s statement of adjustments. Options (2), (3), <br/>and (4) are therefore incorrect. <br/></p>
<p>Question 245 <br/>Answer: 1 <br/>Find the effective annual rate of interest on the funds advanced given the contract terms.  <br/>Press Display <br/>12 &#61568; P/YR 12 <br/>48000 PV 48,000 <br/>499.76 +/&#61473; PMT &#61473;499.76 <br/>60 N  60 <br/>45167.5 +/&#61473; FV  &#61473;45,167.5 <br/>I/YR  11.618034 (j12) <br/>&#61568; EFF% 12.257094 (j1) <br/></p>
<p>Question 246 <br/>Answer: 2 <br/>Option (2) is correct because licensees have a duty to maintain the integrity of the real estate profession, <br/>including holding others in the profession to the highest standards. Option (1) is incorrect because ethical <br/>standards are not the same as the legal requirements for a licensee.  Professional ethics standards are often <br/>higher standards compared to legislative standards. Option (3) is incorrect because the duties of full disclosure, <br/>confidentiality, acting in accordance with lawful instruction, and acting in a client&#8217;s best interests are all duties <br/>under the Rules and fiduciary duties. Option (4) is incorrect because professional ethics apply when dealing <br/>with clients, non-clients, and other real estate professionals. </p>


<p>Question 247 <br/>Answer: 3 <br/>Option (3) is correct because the comparable will need an adjustment of +$2,700 for 1 bathroom since the <br/>subject has one more bathroom than the comparable. In addition, there is a - $5,000 adjustment for the 100 <br/>square foot difference in size because the subject is smaller than the comparable. Options (1), (2), and (4) are <br/>therefore incorrect. <br/></p>
<p>Question 248 <br/>Answer: 2 <br/>Option (2) is correct because the shopping behaviour model classifies products and services based on the <br/>amount of effort that a consumer is willing to go through to obtain that product or service. There is no superior <br/>goods classification. Options (1), (3), and (4) are incorrect because this classification system includes <br/>convenience goods, shopping goods, specialty goods, and unsought goods. <br/></p>
<p>Question 249 <br/>Answer: 4 <br/> <b>Seller&#8217;s Statement of Adjustments</b> <br/><b>ITEM     DEBIT   CREDIT <br/></b>Purchase Price  120,000.00 <br/>Commission   6,000.00  <br/>Buyer's Share of Taxes*      <b>372.00</b> <br/>Cash Proceeds of Sale 114,372.00 _________ <br/> 120,372.00 120,372.00 <br/>* (Aug. 30-Dec. 31 = 124 days) 124/365 &#61512; $1,095 = $372 <br/></p>
<p>Question 250 <br/>Answer: 2 <br/>Calculate the nominal rate, compounded quarterly from the quarterly rate. <br/> <br/></p>
<p>1.5% &#61512; 4 = 6% <br/> <br/>The nominal rate, compounded quarterly (j4) is 6%. <br/></p>
<p>Question 251 <br/>Answer: 2 <br/>Option (2) is correct because of an implied term required in mortgage law that, upon full repayment of the loan, <br/>a borrower has the right to have title reconveyed to him or her in the same state as it was at the time of the <br/>making of the mortgage (usually this means title will be free and clear of all encumbrances). Any term which <br/>seeks to provide otherwise is considered to be a &#8220;clog on the equity of redemption&#8221; and will be of no effect, or <br/>void. Option (1) is incorrect because any term which is void cannot be valid. Option (3) is incorrect because a <br/>term which purports to clog the equity of redemption is not considered to be illegal; rather, it will simply not be <br/>enforced by the courts. Option (4) is incorrect because it confuses a clog on the equity of redemption with a <br/>stipulation for a collateral advantage. Problems related to collateral advantages are no longer considered a clog <br/>on the equity of redemption and are instead debated in terms of unreasonable restraints of trade. </p>


<p>Question 252 <br/>Answer: 1 <br/> Option (1) is correct because bridge financing is a type of interim financing whereby a borrower will receive a <br/>loan and grant a mortgage to a lender for a short period while long-term financing is being pursued. Bridge <br/>financing can be used where a borrower has purchased property but has not sold his or her existing property <br/>and financing to purchase the new property is required. Option (2) is incorrect as a conventional mortgage <br/>would be the most effective financing option for Jonathan in this situation. Option (3) is incorrect as a reverse <br/>annuity mortgage would best allow Jonathan to access the equity in his home to make a purchase. Option (4) is <br/>incorrect as it would not require any financing, since Jonathan wants to pay completely from his savings.     <br/></p>
<p>Question 253 <br/>Answer: 2 <br/>Option (2) is correct because when using the cost approach of appraisal, cost of the improvements is normally <br/>determined by utilizing the current replacement cost. Replacement cost is the cost of providing a building that <br/>would represent the modern equivalent of the house to be appraised in determining the construction cost of a <br/>building. Options (1), (3), and (4) are incorrect for this reason. <br/></p>
<p>Question 254 <br/>Answer: 4 <br/>Option (4) is correct because the Strata Property Act applies to strata plans deposited on or after July 1, 2000, <br/>replacing the Schedule of Interest on Destruction which was used under previous legislation. Section 273 and <br/>278 of the Act provide for a &#8220;conversion schedule&#8221; or &#8220;interest schedule&#8221; that will be employed to determine the <br/>distribution of the proceeds in the event that a strata complex is destroyed and the owners decide to take the <br/>insurance money instead of rebuilding. Option (1) is incorrect because the value of each strata lot is different <br/>and therefore it would be unfair to distribute insurance policy proceeds equally between all owners. Options (2) <br/>and (3) are incorrect because they are based on unit entitlement, which is similar to the Schedule of Interest on <br/>Destruction, which is only used for strata plans deposited prior to July 1, 2000. <br/></p>
<p>Question 255 <br/>Answer: 2 <br/>Option (2) is correct because the comparative approach of appraisal is most appropriate where buyers and <br/>sellers are well informed about current sales transactions. Options (1) and (3) are incorrect because the <br/>comparative approach of appraisal is applicable when there is sufficient recent sales data of similar properties, <br/>and the property does not have redevelopment potential. Option (4) is incorrect because under the comparative <br/>approach, a property&#8217;s value should not exceed the cost of purchasing an alternative property that can provide <br/>similar utility. Therefore, it may not be appropriate if a property is unique.  <br/></p>
<p>Question 256 <br/>Answer: 2 <br/>Option (2) is correct because, although the Real Estate Services Act outlines certain disclosure requirements in <br/>Section 5-10, the common law considers an agent&#8217;s duties and responsibilities to the principal to be one of a <br/>fiduciary nature and requires a duty of loyalty, which includes both confidentiality and FULL disclosure, above <br/>and beyond what is required in Section 5-10. Options (1) and (4) are incorrect because the common law may <br/>extend a licensee&#8217;s disclosure responsibilities beyond the duty to disclose laid out in Section 5-10. Option (3) is <br/>incorrect because making a secret profit would violate the duty of utmost loyalty and full disclosure. </p>


<p>Question 257 <br/>Answer: 4 <br/>Option (4) is correct because the assessor&#8217;s primary purpose under the Assessment Act is to provide actual <br/>values on which to apply tax levies. Option (1) is incorrect because the municipal council sets the general tax <br/>rate for each class of property in a given territory, but does not determine the actual value of the property. <br/>Option (2) is incorrect because the British Columbia Financial Services Authority does not establish actual <br/>value of property. Option (3) is incorrect because the Lieutenant-Governor in Council appoints the Property <br/>Assessment Appeal board, but is not involved in assessing the actual value of a piece of property. <br/></p>
<p>Question 258 <br/>Answer: 4 <br/>Option (4) is the correct answer as a mortgage typically has long terms and amortization periods. Option (1) is <br/>incorrect because mortgages do not trade publicly such as bonds and stocks, making them relatively illiquid. <br/>Options (2) and (3) are incorrect because mortgage loans also require a high degree of administrative work, and <br/>a relatively high initial outlay of capital compared to other investments. <br/></p>
<p>Question 259 <br/>Answer: 3 <br/>Option (3) is correct because a restrictive covenant is an interest in land which imposes a restriction on the use <br/>of one person&#8217;s land (the servient tenement) for the benefit of another piece of land (the dominant tenement). <br/>Option (1) is incorrect because a licence creates a positive right, not a restriction. Option (2) is incorrect because <br/>a caveat is a notice registered against the title to land warning those searching the registrar that someone is <br/>claiming an estate or interest in land against the title. Option (4) is incorrect because an easement gives the <br/>holder a positive right to use the neighbouring land for his benefit, whereas a restrictive covenant prevents the <br/>neighbouring land from being used in a particular way. <br/></p>
<p>Question 260 <br/>Answer: 2 <br/>Option (2) is correct because every strata plan must include a Schedule of Unit Entitlement. Option (1) is <br/>incorrect because the required drawings must show the strata lots distinguished by number or letter in <br/>consecutive order, but they are not necessarily required to show the street address of each strata lot. Option (3) <br/>is incorrect because there are no Standard Rules provided in legislation, and there is no requirement for a strata <br/>corporation to create Rules. Rather, there is only a requirement for there to be bylaws in place when the strata <br/>plan is filed. Option (4) is incorrect because the area of each strata lot must be indicated in square metres, not <br/>square feet. <br/></p>
<p>Question 261 <br/>Answer: 3 <br/>Option (3) is correct because an investor can typically procure debt financing at a rate lower than the expected <br/>yield on investment. This allows the investor to cover the debt payments with the revenue generated from the <br/>investment. Option (1) is incorrect because only the interest portion of mortgage payments are tax deductible. <br/>Option (2) is incorrect as most terms are typically longer than one term, and this provides no advantage to the <br/>investment. Option (4) is incorrect as the change in property values has no influence on the investor&#8217;s choice of <br/>debt or equity financing. </p>


<p>Question 262 <br/>Answer: 1 <br/>Option (1) is correct because licensees must act honestly with non-clients, which includes being truthful about <br/>the property and the fact that Dave intends to remove the tree before the property is sold. Option (2) is incorrect <br/>because an exception to the duty to communicate all offers to the client is if a client specifically instructs their <br/>licensee not to communicate offers to them promptly. Option (3) is incorrect because Shaylena has not been <br/>asked to give advice outside of her area of expertise. Option (4) is incorrect because Shaylena has breached the <br/>duties to act honestly and to act with reasonable care and skill. <br/></p>
<p>Question 263 <br/>Answer: 4 <br/>Option (4) is correct because a contract made without consideration can still be enforceable if it is made under <br/>seal. However, all other elements of a valid contract must still be present. Options (1) and (2) are incorrect <br/>because executing a contract under seal does not remove the requirement under section 59 of the Law and <br/>Equity Act that, in most cases, contracts affecting land must be in writing and signed in order to be enforceable <br/>in court. Option (3) is incorrect because the parties must have intended to create legal obligations in order for a <br/>contract to be formed, whether or not it is executed under seal. <br/></p>
<p>Question 264 <br/>Answer: 3 <br/>Option (3) is correct because on the completion date the seller is obligated to transfer title and the buyer is <br/>obligated to pay the purchase price in accordance with the contract for purchase and sale. Option (1) is <br/>incorrect because the statements of adjustment of the buyer and seller are treated separately and are not <br/>comprised of identical information. Option (2) is incorrect because, although the amount of taxes for the year <br/>are apportioned between the parties as of the adjustment date, the party &#8220;held responsible&#8221; for their share of the <br/>taxes will depend on whether the property taxes for the year have been paid already by the seller or will be due <br/>in the future to be paid by the buyer. Option (4) is incorrect because, although the adjustment and possession <br/>dates are most often the same, they are not required to be so. The adjustment date may coincide with either the <br/>completion or possession date or fall in between the two. <br/></p>
<p>Question 265 <br/>Answer: 1 <br/>Option (1) is correct because payment of the deposit is generally not subject to GST until closing occurs, at <br/>which time the full amount of the sale price (including the deposit) becomes taxable. Option (2) is incorrect <br/>because no GST applies to reimbursements for prepayments. Option (3) is incorrect because under section <br/>165(1) of the Excise Tax Act, the buyer (the &#8220;recipient&#8221;) has the obligation to pay the GST. Option (4) is incorrect <br/>because only amounts on the statements of adjustments that are legally components of the purchase price are <br/>subject to GST. <br/></p>
<p>Question 266 <br/>Answer: 4 <br/>Option (4) is correct because all of the above statements are true. Option (1) is true because a contract is formed <br/>when there is unequivocal acceptance of an offer. When S accepted B&#8217;s offer to purchase the property for <br/>$75,000, a contract between S and B was formed. Then, when A accepted S&#8217;s offer to purchase the property for <br/>$50,000 within the time period stipulated in the offer, a contract between A and S was formed. Option (2) is true <br/>because an offer expires when the offeror communicates revocation before acceptance, so A would no longer <br/>have been able to accept S&#8217;s offer. Option (3) is true because S is entitled to accept B&#8217;s offer, but S will be liable <br/>for damages to A because S cannot convey the property as promised and will be in breach of their contract. </p>


<p>Question 267 <br/>Answer: 4 <br/>Option (4) is correct because it is impossible to determine when the loan will be completely repaid with the <br/>information given. This is an interest only loan, and no payments are made on the principal. The principal of <br/>the loan is completely repaid on a date set between the lender and the borrower. Options (1), (2), and (3) are <br/>incorrect for this reason. <br/></p>
<p>Question 268 <br/>Answer: 4 <br/>Calculate the effective annual rate of interest of 10% per annum, compounded semi-annually, and the effective <br/>annual rates of interest for each option. <br/> <br/>Press Display <br/>10 &#61568; NOM% 10 <br/>2 &#61568; P/YR 2 <br/>&#61568; EFF% 10.25 <br/> <br/>Option (1): <br/>9 &#61568; NOM% 9 <br/>2 &#61568; P/YR 2 <br/>&#61568; EFF% 9.2025 <br/> <br/>Option (2): <br/>10% per annum compounded annually = 10% effective annual rate  <br/> <br/>Option (3): <br/>10 &#61568; NOM% 10 <br/>12 &#61568; P/YR 12 <br/>&#61568; EFF% 10.471307 <br/> <br/>Option (4): <br/>9.9 &#61568; NOM% 9.9 <br/>365 &#61568; P/YR 365 <br/>&#61568; EFF% 10.405148  <br/> <br/>Therefore, Option (4) is correct.  </p>


<p>Question 269 <br/>Answer: 2 <br/>In this question, calculate the NOI in order to find the market yield for each comparable.  <br/>  <br/></p>
<p>NOI = Gross Potential Rent &#61473; Operating Expenses &#61473; Vacancy Rate <br/>Market Yield = NOI &#247; Sale Price <br/> <br/>Comparable ABC: <br/>NOI = $124,000 &#61473; $44,000 &#61473; (0.04 &#61512; $124,000) = $75,040 <br/>Market Yield = $75,040 &#247; $635,930 = 11.8% <br/> <br/>Comparable XYZ: <br/>NOI = $138,000 &#61473; $50,000 &#61473; (0.04 &#61512; $138,000) = $82,480 <br/>Market Yield = $82,480 &#247; $711,000 = 11.6% <br/></p>
<p>Thus, the market yield is between 11.6% and 11.8%.  <br/></p>
<p>Question 270 <br/>Answer: 1 <br/>Option (1) is correct because an individual must be licensed to and engaged by a brokerage in order to obtain <br/>and maintain a licence as a representative. Option (2) is incorrect because although a licensee may wish to <br/>incorporate his or her own Personal Real Estate Corporation, it is not a requirement that they do so as long as <br/>they are employed under and licensed to a brokerage. Option (3) is incorrect because ensuring the books and <br/>records are properly managed is a duty of the managing broker, not a representative. Option (4) is incorrect <br/>because there is no requirement for a representative to file at least one real estate transaction with the British <br/>Columbia Financial Services Authority each year. <br/></p>
<p>Question 271 <br/>Answer: 3 <br/>Option (3) is correct because the payments of a loan contract are calculated based on a contract yield rate. If the <br/>discount, or expected yield rate decreases, the present value of the given contracted payments increases. <br/>Options (1), (2), and (4) are incorrect for this reason. <br/></p>
<p>Question 272 <br/>Answer: 1 <br/>The market value of the mortgage is calculated by valuing the contracted loan payments at the market rate. The <br/>market value of the offer is the market value of the mortgage plus the cash down payment. <br/> <br/>Press Display <br/>7.5 &#61568; NOM% 7.5 <br/>2 &#61568; P/YR 2 <br/>&#61568; EFF% 7.640625 <br/>12 &#61568; P/YR 12 <br/>&#61568; NOM% 7.385429 <br/>755.31 +/&#61473; PMT &#61473;755.31 <br/>240 N 240 <br/>0 FV  0 <br/>PV 94,579.014897 (market value of the mortgage) <br/>+ 75000 =  169,579.014897 (market value of the offer) <br/> <br/>The market value of the offer is $169,579, rounded to the nearest dollar. </p>


<p>Question 273 <br/>Answer: 3 <br/>Option (3) is correct because the principle of indefeasibility will not protect a registered owner who is on title as <br/>a result of fraud in which he or she participated. Since Duke forged the transfer document, he is not protected <br/>by indefeasibility and Earl will be able to recover title to Blackacre from Duke. The property will not remain <br/>encumbered by Royalty&#8217;s mortgage because a mortgage is registered as a charge, and charges are not granted <br/>indefeasibility; rather, registration of a charge only raises a rebuttable presumption that the charge is valid. <br/>Options (1) and (2) are incorrect because the holder of a charge cannot rely on a title holder&#8217;s indefeasibility and <br/>Earl will be able to rebut the presumption of the validity of the mortgage by showing that Duke was registered <br/>on title as a result of forgery. Option (4) is incorrect because a claim against the Assurance Fund can only be <br/>successful where the operation of the Land Title Act caused the party to lose his or her interest, and Royalty <br/>would not have had an interest in the property at common law under the rule of nemo dat.  <br/></p>
<p>Question 274 <br/>Answer: 3 <br/>Find the number of months necessary to amortize the loan. <br/>  <br/>Press Display <br/>7 &#61568; NOM% 7 <br/>2 &#61568; P/YR 2 <br/>&#61568; EFF% 7.1225 <br/>12 &#61568; P/YR 12 <br/>&#61568; NOM% 6.900047 <br/>32000 PV 32,000 <br/>1400 +/&#61473; PMT &#61473;1,400 <br/>0 FV 0 <br/>N  24.575695 <br/> <br/>The loan will be amortized in approximately 24 months, or 2 years. <br/></p>
<p>Question 275 <br/>Answer: 4 <br/>Option (4) is the correct response because it describes an official community plan. Option (1) is incorrect <br/>because a community plan does not require the municipality or regional district to carry out every detail <br/>specified in the plan. Rather, it requires that all bylaws enacted, permits issued, and work undertaken after its <br/>enactment be consistent with the plan. Option (2) is incorrect because only bylaws enacted subsequent to the <br/>enactment of the plan are affected. Option (3) is incorrect because a plan prepared by a regional district may be <br/>required to provide the Minister of Municipal Affairs with information regarding public support for the plan, <br/>and the minister may require a referendum to determine the degree of public support for the plan. <br/></p>
<p>Question 276 <br/>Answer: 4 <br/>Option (4) is correct because the risk involved in being a mortgagee is increased due to the greater degree of <br/>management time involved. Option (1) is incorrect because mortgage risk is higher than that of Canadian <br/>government bonds. Option (2) is incorrect because investors are willing to accept higher risk for higher return; <br/>if the interest rate is high enough, investors will accept the risk of lending mortgage funds. Option (3) is <br/>incorrect because mortgage risk can also be reduced through careful borrower qualification measures. </p>


<p>Question 277 <br/>Answer: 3 <br/>Option (3) is correct because a common mistake is one where both parties to a contract have made the same <br/>mistake about a fundamental term of the contract. Here, both parties have made the mistake of assuming that <br/>the home had not been destroyed at the time they entered into the contract. Option (1) is incorrect because a <br/>mutual mistake occurs when each party makes a different fundamental mistake about the contract, and in this <br/>case the same mistake was made. Option (2) is incorrect because frustration of a contract happens due to events <br/>occurring after the contract was entered into, and here the home was destroyed before the contract was formed. <br/>Option (4) is incorrect because an anticipatory breach occurs when one party announces that he or she will not <br/>perform before the time of performance arrives, which has not occurred in this scenario. <br/></p>
<p>Question 278 <br/>Answer: 4 <br/>Option (4) is correct (i.e., would NOT be available as a remedy to Lawson) because this is a commercial tenancy, <br/>and so the Residential Tenancy Act would not apply. Options (1), (2), and (3) are incorrect because each of these <br/>remedies WOULD be available to Lawson for non-payment of rent on commercial premises. <br/></p>
<p>Question 279 <br/>Answer: 4 <br/>Option (4) is the correct answer as the interest adjustment period of the loan will not affect the maximum <br/>amount a borrower may qualify for. Options (1), (2), and (3) are incorrect because with higher income, higher <br/>property lending value, and lower mortgage interest rates, a borrower will be able to qualify for a higher <br/>maximum loan.  <br/></p>
<p>Question 280 <br/>Answer: 4 <br/>Find the maximum loan allowable given the borrower&#8217;s payment constraints and the given loan criterion, <br/>assuming the loan is fully amortized in 25 years. <br/> <br/>Press Display <br/>4 &#61568; NOM% 4 <br/>2 &#61568; P/YR 2 <br/>&#61568; EFF% 4.04 <br/>12 &#61568; P/YR 12 <br/>&#61568; NOM% 3.967068 <br/>850 +/&#61473; PMT &#61473;850 <br/>300 N 300 <br/>0 FV 0 <br/>PV 161,590.750973 <br/> <br/>The maximum loan allowable is $161,590.75. <br/></p>
<p>Question 281  <br/>Answer: 1 <br/>Option (1) is correct because when a licensee represents only one party as a client in a given transaction, it is <br/>called a sole agency relationship. Option (2) is incorrect because an agency relationship exists when a licensee <br/>represents a client. Option (3) is incorrect because a limited dual agency relationship exists when a brokerage or <br/>licensee acts for multiple parties in a single trade in real estate, but because the duty of loyalty cannot be <br/>fulfilled to all clients, the clients agree to a limited form of agency relationship. This practice is now prohibited <br/>under section 63 of the Rules. Option (4) is incorrect because an agency relationship is not referred to as a &#8220;full <br/>agency relationship&#8221;. </p>


<p>Question 282 <br/>Answer: 1 <br/>Option (1) is correct. To find the adjusted sale price of the comparable, take the sum of the listed sale price with <br/>its adjustments to the subject property. In this case, the subject property and the comparable are identical <br/>except that the subject property has 1 additional bedroom and 1 additional bathroom. The adjusted sale price <br/>is: $221,000 + $4,000 +$5,700 = $230,700. <br/></p>
<p>Question 283 <br/>Answer: 2 <br/>Find the present value from the required yield rate and the sale price at the end of three years, or six <br/>semi-annual compounding periods. <br/> <br/>Press Display <br/>10 I/YR 10 <br/>2 &#61568; P/YR 2 <br/>55000 FV 55,000 <br/>6 N 6 <br/>0 PMT 0 <br/>PV  &#61473;41,041.846815 <br/> <br/>The investor would be willing to pay $41,041.85. <br/></p>
<p>Question 284 <br/>Answer: 4 <br/>Option (4) is correct (false) because the single best thing you can do to improve your negotiation effectiveness is <br/>to prepare. Options (1), (2), and (3) are incorrect because they are true statements. <br/></p>
<p>Question 285 <br/>Answer: 4 <br/>Find the present value of the mortgage from the given terms. <br/> <br/>Press Display <br/>8 &#61568; NOM% 8 <br/>2 &#61568; P/YR 2 <br/>&#61568; EFF% 8.16 <br/>12 &#61568; P/YR 12 <br/>&#61568; NOM% 7.869836 <br/>0 FV 0 <br/>240 N 240 <br/>390 +/&#61473; PMT &#61473;390 <br/>PV  47,081.122383  <br/> <br/>The investor should purchase the mortgage for $47,081.12 to earn j2 = 8%. </p>


<p>Question 286 <br/>Answer: 1 <br/>Option (1) is correct because a condition precedent is a condition in a contract which must be satisfied before <br/>the contract is to be performed, and is the formal term for what is usually called a &#8220;subject to&#8221; clause in the real <br/>estate industry. Options (2), (3), and (4) are types of clauses which might be found in a contract that are distinct <br/>from &#8220;subject to&#8221; clauses. Option (2) is incorrect because a warranty is a clause which is not fundamental to the <br/>contract and whose breach would not allow a party to terminate the contract, only to sue for damages. Option <br/>(3) is incorrect because &#8220;subject to&#8221; clauses must are conditions precedent (they precede contractual <br/>performance) rather than conditions subsequent. Option (4) is incorrect because a penalty clause is a clause <br/>which states that a party who breaches the contract must pay a penalty to the innocent party. These clauses will <br/>not be enforced by the courts. <br/></p>
<p>Question 287 <br/>Answer: 2 <br/>Option (2) is correct because the Real Estate Services Act requires a signed copy of the acceptance to be <br/>delivered to each of the parties to the transaction. Therefore, Allan, Bob, and Carol each require an individual <br/>copy as they are all parties to the transaction. Options (1), (3), and (4) are incorrect because they would each <br/>result in a party to the transaction not receiving a signed copy of the agreement. <br/></p>
<p>Question 288 <br/>Answer: 2 <br/>Option (2) is correct because the test to determine whether an agreement creates a lease or a licence is a matter <br/>of intention between the parties, which is determined by examining the agreement, the surrounding <br/>circumstances, and the purpose behind the agreement. Option (1) is incorrect because formal wording and <br/>inclusion of terms in an agreement such as &#8220;lessor/lessee&#8221; or &#8220;licensor/licensee&#8221; will not necessarily be <br/>determinative of parties&#8217; intentions. Options (3) and (4) are incorrect because the Residential Tenancy Act and <br/>the Commercial Tenancy Act do not apply to the holder of a licence. <br/></p>
<p>Question 289 <br/>Answer: 3 <br/>Option (3) is correct because in the comparative approach of appraisal, &#8220;recent&#8221; refers to a time period during <br/>which demand and supply conditions in the area are relatively stable or do not change. &#8220;Recent&#8221; is the period of <br/>time, immediately preceding the appraisal date, during which property values in the region have remained <br/>stable. Options (1), (2), and (4) are incorrect for this reason.  <br/></p>
<p>Question 290 <br/>Answer: 2 <br/>Option (2) is correct because a weak secondary market for mortgages means that there are not a large amount of <br/>buyers and sellers of mortgages that already exist. Due to this, the investors&#8217; funds are &#8220;locked in&#8221; to the interest <br/>rate written in their original contracts, and they cannot achieve the current rate until the end of the term, or <br/>until they recover enough capital to initiate a new mortgage at the new rate. Options (1), (3), and (4) are <br/>incorrect because they do not describe reasons for mortgage rates&#8217; &#8220;stickiness&#8221;.  </p>


<p>Question 291 <br/>Answer: 2 <br/>Option (2) is correct because private nuisance occurs when an owner or occupier of land unreasonably and <br/>substantially interferes with the reasonable use and enjoyment of a neighbouring property, which includes <br/>activities which product noxious fumes. Hurston&#8217;s venting highly toxic gas over Ralph&#8217;s apple orchard, <br/>destroying his crop, would classify as an unreasonable and substantial interference with Ralph&#8217;s ability to use <br/>and enjoy his land. Option (1) is incorrect because XYZ could be vicariously liable for Hurston&#8217;s activities as <br/>their employee or negligent for failing to prevent Hurston from creating the nuisance. Option (3) is incorrect <br/>because Ralph would have a remedy against Hurston, as the person who created the nuisance is liable for doing <br/>so. Option (4) is incorrect because the Occupiers Liability Act would only apply if Ralph and/or his property <br/>had been harmed while on XYZ&#8217;s property. <br/></p>
<p>Question 292 <br/>Answer: 2 <br/>Option (2) is correct because a characteristic of a straight line principal reduction loan is that payments will <br/>decrease over time. This is favourable to a borrower that expects his or her income to decrease in the future. <br/>Option (1) is incorrect because a straight line principal reduction plan does not permit a borrower to delay <br/>repayment, as it provides for higher initial payments. Option (3) is incorrect because a borrower who foresees <br/>his or her income increasing would prefer to make higher payments in the future, rather than immediately. <br/>Option (4) is incorrect because initial payments will be higher than future payments.  <br/></p>
<p>Question 293 <br/>Answer: 3 <br/>Option (3) is correct because the duty of full disclosure requires Billy to disclose all known material information <br/>to his client, including the buyer&#8217;s intentions for the property. Option (1) is incorrect because Julio has followed <br/>his professional obligations and satisfied the duty of full disclosure. Option (2) is incorrect because Gabriel has <br/>fulfilled his duty to advise his client to seek independent professional advice on matters outside of his expertise. <br/>Option (4) is incorrect because Simon has communicated all of the offers he received to his client and fulfilled <br/>his professional obligations. <br/></p>
<p>Question 294 <br/>Answer: 4 <br/>Option (4) is correct because all of the statements would appear as debits on the seller&#8217;s statement. Option (1) <br/>would appear as a debit on the seller&#8217;s statement of adjustments because an existing mortgage on title which <br/>will be assumed by the buyer on completion of the sale reduces the amount of cash that the buyer will owe to <br/>the seller. For Option (2), the seller is responsible for clearing the title of any encumbrances and any fees for this <br/>are the responsibility of the seller, which would reduce the amount of cash due to him or her and would be <br/>shown as a debit to the seller. For Option (3), the seller is liable to pay overdue taxes and any penalty owing as a <br/>result of late payment. This reduces the amount of cash owed to the seller and would appear as a debit on their <br/>statement of adjustments. <br/></p>
<p>Question 295 <br/>Answer: 2 <br/>Option (2) is correct because the offeree should generally communicate acceptance using the same method as <br/>the offer was made, if the offer does not specify otherwise. Options (1), (3), and (4) are incorrect because they do <br/>not generally describe the proper means of communicating acceptance. Rather, they are methods of <br/>communication that are potentially acceptable, depending on the way in which the offer was communicated <br/>and the terms of the offer.  </p>


<p>Question 296 <br/>Answer: 4 <br/>Option (4) is correct because purchasing assets will not affect owner&#8217;s equity. The purchase of the assets will <br/>either be funded by cash that will result in no net change in assets, or it will be funded by debt, which will <br/>increase both assets and liabilities. Option (1) is incorrect because Investment by the owner will increase the <br/>amount of equity. Option (2) is incorrect because personal withdrawals from the business will decrease the <br/>amount of equity. Option (3) is incorrect because earning net income will also increase the amount of equity. <br/></p>
<p>Question 297 <br/>Answer: 3 <br/>Option (3) is correct because there is an implied covenant on the part of a commercial landlord to let the tenant <br/>into possession of the leased premises and, if they do not do so, they will be liable for damages. Option (1) is <br/>incorrect because a commercial tenant cannot get an order for specific performance in these circumstances due <br/>to the common law doctrine of interesse termini, which provides that no estate in land passes until the tenant <br/>takes possession. Option (2) is incorrect because quiet enjoyment relates to the tenant&#8217;s ability to use and enjoy <br/>the premises for all usual purposes without interference or unreasonable disturbance from the landlord, which <br/>would apply once the tenant is already in possession of the premises. Option (4) is incorrect because the tenant <br/>would be entitled to sue the landlord for damages. <br/></p>
<p>Question 298 <br/>Answer: 2 <br/>Option (2) is the correct answer because this option represents the subjective value to the owner. Market value <br/>should be an objective value at a specific point in time. Options (1), (3), and (4) all form part of the definition of <br/>market value. <br/></p>
<p>Question 299 <br/>Answer: 4 <br/>Option (4) is correct because the basic criteria to qualify for a home owner grant is that the person claiming the <br/>grant must be the owner of the property and must occupy it as a principal residence. Option (1) is incorrect <br/>because an owner&#8217;s name may appear on the assessment roll, but they would not qualify for a home owner <br/>grant if they were not occupying the property. Option (2) is incorrect because a tenant is not an owner of the <br/>property. Option (3) is incorrect because an owner must live at the property in order to claim a home owner <br/>grant. <br/></p>
<p>Question 300 <br/>Answer: 3 <br/>Option (3) is correct because, in addition to the educational and experience requirements, the Real Estate <br/>Services Act (RESA) requires that an applicant must be at least 19 years of age. Option (1) is incorrect because <br/>qualification for a managing broker&#8217;s licence requires a licensee to have been providing real estate services in a <br/>Canadian province or the Yukon for at least two years during the five years before the date of the application. <br/>Option (2) is incorrect because Canadian citizenship is not required to qualify for a managing broker&#8217;s licence. <br/>Option (4) is incorrect because a minimum of 19 years of age is required under RESA. </p>


<p>Question 301  <br/>Answer: 2 <br/>Option (2) is correct because a licensee must obtain a written agreement of dual agency by both clients before <br/>providing services within the dual agency relationship. Option (1) is incorrect because an Agreement Regarding <br/>Conflict of Interest Between Clients is entered into when a licensee faces a conflict of interest when acting for <br/>multiple clients, and obtains written consent by all clients to continue to represent only one client. Option (3) is <br/>incorrect because a Disclosure of Interest in Trade form is required when a licensee or an associate of a licensee <br/>(being provided real estate services by the licensee) is to directly or indirectly acquire or dispose of real estate. <br/>Option (4) is incorrect because a Disclosure of Risks to Unrepresented Parties form is required when a licensee <br/>makes a disclosure under section 54 of the Rules to an unrepresented party while also representing a client to <br/>that trade in real estate. <br/></p>
<p>Question 302 <br/>Answer: 2 <br/>Option (2) is correct because under sections 49 and 50 of the Rules, licensees are prohibited from making <br/>promises to others in an attempt to induce them to enter into service agreements or enter into real estate <br/>transactions UNLESS the licensee delivers a signed statement setting out the details of the promise to the <br/>person to whom the promise is made. Options (1), (3), and (4) are incorrect because making full disclosure to <br/>both the seller and the buyer, sending a copy of such a promise to the British Columbia Financial Services <br/>Authority, and providing a statement under oath without details of the promise will not be enough to prevent a <br/>violation of the rule if the signed statement containing details is not given to the promisee. <br/></p>
<p>Question 303 <br/>Answer: 1 <br/>Find the present value of the mortgage from the given terms. <br/> <br/>Press Display <br/>15 &#61568; NOM% 15 <br/>1 &#61568; P/YR 1 <br/>&#61568; EFF% 15 <br/>12 &#61568; P/YR 12 <br/>&#61568; NOM% 14.0579 <br/>650 +/&#61473; PMT &#61473;650 <br/>48 N 48 <br/>55858.13 +/&#61473; FV &#61473;55,585.13 <br/>PV  55,698.259135 <br/> <br/>The purchase price of this loan will be $55,698.26.  <br/>  </p>


<p>Question 304 <br/>Answer: 3 <br/>Option (3) is correct because a strata corporation may amend the Standard Bylaws in the Strata Property Act by <br/>creating a new custom-made bylaw, but they may not enforce such a bylaw until it has been filed at the land <br/>title office. Option (1) is incorrect because a vote&#8217;s decision making value is not determined by the lot&#8217;s unit <br/>entitlement &#8211; rather, one vote per lot is given regardless of the size of the lot. Option (2) is incorrect because <br/>rental restriction bylaws do not apply to strata units for one full year following their passage or, if there is a <br/>tenant in a strata lot on the day the new bylaw is passed, the one-year grace period only begins on the day the <br/>tenant vacates the strata lot. Option (4) is incorrect because the strata lot is restricted to its description in the <br/>strata plan, and everything outside of that parcel is considered to be common property. <br/></p>
<p>Question 305 <br/>Answer: 3 <br/>Option (3) is correct because bylaws govern owners&#8217; obligations as well as their use of the strata lots and the <br/>common property and common assets. Option (1) is incorrect because bylaws are passed by the strata <br/>corporation, not just the council. Option (2) is incorrect because a strata corporation may only restrict the rental <br/>of a strata lot by a bylaw that prohibits the rental of residential strata lots, not commercial. Option (4) is <br/>incorrect because Options (1) and (2) are both incorrect. <br/></p>

<p>The yield to the purchaser is 20%. <br/></p>
<p>Question 307 <br/>Answer: 4 <br/>Option (4) is correct because Transport Canada requires a Special Flight Operations Certificate for drones <br/>weighing over 25 kilograms that are used for commercial purposes such as real estate marketing. Option (1) is <br/>incorrect because drones are less, not more, expensive than helicopters. Option (2) is incorrect because a drone <br/>used for real estate marketing must be insured. Option (3) is incorrect because a drone is generally flown <br/>during daylight hours. <br/></p>
<p>Question 308 <br/>Answer: 1 <br/>Option (1) is correct because the defining characteristics of a West Coast design style are angular roof <br/>components and large glass areas. Options (2), (3), and (4) are incorrect because they do not describe West Coast <br/>design style. <br/>  </p>


<p>Question 309 <br/>Answer: 1 <br/>The market value of Linda&#8217;s offer is the market value of the mortgage plus her cash down payment. Linda will <br/>assume the remaining 36 monthly payments of $1,356.78 and the outstanding balance of $150,948.60. <br/>Calculate the market value of the mortgage by determining the PV of the payments and OSB remaining at the <br/>end of the original 5-year term based on the current market rate of j12 = 5%. <br/> <br/>Press Display <br/>5 I/YR 5 <br/>12 &#61568; P/YR 12 <br/>1356.78 +/&#61473; PMT &#61473;1,356.78 <br/>150948.6 +/&#61473; FV &#61473;150,948.6 <br/>36 N 36 <br/>PV  175,233.074951 (market value of the mortgage) <br/>+ 45000 =  220,233.074951 (market value of the offer) <br/> <br/>The market value of Linda&#8217;s offer is $220,233.07. <br/></p>
<p>Question 310 <br/>Answer: 3 <br/>Option (3) is correct because there is no requirement for the dominant and servient tenements to be owned by <br/>different parties in order for an easement to be valid. Options (1), (2), and (4) are incorrect because an easement <br/>requires that there be a dominant and servient tenement, that the easement accommodate the dominant <br/>tenement, and that the easement be capable of forming the subject matter of a grant in order to be valid. <br/></p>
<p>Question 311 <br/>Answer: 4 <br/>Option (4) is correct because the Assessment Notice indicates the actual value of a property as determined by <br/>the assessor. Options (1), (2), and (3) are incorrect because they refer to concepts which do not determine the <br/>actual value of a property. </p>


<p>Question 312 <br/>Answer: 3 <br/>To answer this question, calculate the maximum amount of money that can be lent out given the two <br/>constraints: the loan-to-value amount and the gross debt service ratio amount. Calculate the loan amount for <br/>the loan-to-value constraint and then calculate the loan amount for the GDSR constraint. In order to determine <br/>the maximum amount that the lender will advance, choose the lesser of the two results.  <br/> <br/>LTV = 80%  <br/></p>
<p> <br/>Lending Value = $440,000 <br/>Maximum loan under lender=s LTV criteria = 0.8 &#61512; $440,000 = $352,000  <br/> <br/></p>
<p>GDSR = 32%  <br/> <br/></p>
<p>P I T P I $2,750GDSR 0.32<br/>GI $75,000<br/>+ + + +<br/></p>
<p>= &#8594; =   <br/> <br/>P+I = (GDSR &#61512; GI) B T  <br/>P+I = (0.32 &#61512; $75,000) &#61473; $2,750  <br/>P+I = $21,250 (annual mortgage payment)  <br/> <br/></p>
<p>The loan states that monthly payments are required so:  <br/> <br/>P+I = $21,250 &#247; 12 = $1,770.83 (monthly mortgage payment)  <br/></p>
<p> <br/>The next step is to calculate the maximum loan amount given the contract terms and the monthly payment. <br/> <br/>Press Display <br/>6 &#61568; NOM%  6 <br/>2 &#61568; P/YR 2 <br/>&#61568; EFF% 6.09 <br/>12 &#61568; P/YR 12 <br/>&#61568; NOM%  5.926346 <br/>1770.83 +/&#61473; PMT &#61473;1,770.83 <br/>240 N 240 <br/>0 FV 0 <br/>PV  248,646.270538 <br/> <br/>The maximum loan amount under the GDSR is $248,650, rounded to the nearest $10. <br/>  <br/>The maximum loan amount is the lower of the two constraints: $248,650 &lt; $352,000; therefore, $248,650 is the <br/>maximum amount this lender will advance.  <br/></p>
<p>Question 313 <br/>Answer: 4 <br/>Calculate the semi-annual periodic rate from the semi-annual nominal rate. <br/></p>
<p>12 &#247; 2 = 6 <br/>The periodic rate is 6%. </p>


<p>Question 314 <br/>Answer: 2 <br/>Option (2) is correct because expropriating land for the purpose of adding it to the agricultural land reserve is <br/>not included in the powers of the Agricultural Land Commission. Options (1), (3), and (4) are incorrect because <br/>they are all within the powers granted to the Agricultural Land Commission under the Agricultural Land <br/>Commission Act. <br/></p>
<p>Question 315 <br/>Answer: 3 <br/>Option (3) is correct because salaries payable is a liability account because it represents money that is owed to <br/>another party. Options (1), (2), and (4) are incorrect because depreciation expense, accumulated depreciation, <br/>and interest expense accounts are not classified as a liability because they do not represent a future obligation <br/>to pay a third party. <br/></p>
<p>Question 316 <br/>Answer: 2 <br/>Option (2) is correct because a lease grants exclusive possession of land to another (the tenant) for a specified <br/>term. Option (1) is incorrect because an easement is a separate type of interest in land which does not grant <br/>exclusive possession, but gives a landowner a limited right to use another&#8217;s land for the benefit of his or her <br/>land. Option (3) is incorrect because a license creates a privilege for the person who holds it to enter onto <br/>property for a certain purpose, but does not confer upon the licensee a lease or any other interest in the <br/>property. Option (4) is incorrect because a right of survivorship is a characteristic of a joint tenancy <br/>co-ownership whereby the estate automatically vests in surviving joint tenants on the death of a joint tenant. <br/></p>
<p>Question 317 <br/>Answer: 4 <br/>Option (4) is correct (false) because where the Canada Revenue Agency sends an assessment to the seller for <br/>uncollected GST, the seller has a right to pursue the buyer for the amount of the GST. Options (1), (2), and (3) are <br/>incorrect because they are all true statements. <br/></p>
<p>Question 318 <br/>Answer: 1 <br/>Option (1) is correct because the mortgage qualifying rate is based on the greater of the government-specified <br/>qualifying rate (5.25% as of June 2021) and 2% above the mortgage&#8217;s negotiated contract rate. In this case, you <br/>would apply a rate of j2 = 5.9% (2% + 3.9%), which is greater than the government-specified rate of j2 = 5.25%.  <br/></p>
<p>Question 319 <br/>Answer: 4 <br/>Option (4) is correct because the landlord&#8217;s duty to repair requires that the landlord repair all types of <br/>residential premises under section 32 of the Residential Tenancy Act, even if they were in disrepair when the <br/>tenancy agreement was made. Options (1), (2), and (3) are incorrect because they are overruled by section 32 of <br/>the Act.  </p>


<p>Question 320 <br/>Answer: 4 <br/>Option (4) is correct because while a defect&#8217;s impact on a property&#8217;s value can be objectively determined, a <br/>stigma&#8217;s effect depends on an individual buyer&#8217;s subjective considerations. Some may view the stigma as a <br/>liability, while others may not. Option (1) is incorrect because although stigmas can increase the value of a <br/>property, they can also decrease its value, depending on the individual buyer&#8217;s subjective preferences. Option <br/>(2) is incorrect because sellers are generally not required to disclose stigmas unknown to the buyer. <br/>Additionally, unlike stigmas, some defects must be disclosed by the seller. Option (3) is incorrect because <br/>whether or not the stigma can be discovered through reasonable inspection and inquiries is not a <br/>distinguishing feature of a stigma. Further, only certain defects are discoverable upon a reasonable <br/>examination. <br/></p>
<p>Question 321  <br/>Answer: 1 <br/>Option (1) is correct because a key purpose of the Disclosure of Risks to Unrepresented Parties form is to <br/>encourage unrepresented parties to obtain independent professional advice in respect of the trade in real estate. <br/>Option (2) is incorrect because it does not describe a purpose of the form, as a licensee is permitted to provide <br/>unrepresented parties with limited trading services, provided the licensee adheres to the Rules. Option (3) and <br/>(4) are incorrect because they are not purposes of the form. <br/></p>

<p>Question 324 <br/>Answer: 3 <br/>Option (3) is correct because the sub-market for single-family residences experiences many sales transactions <br/>so there is a more abundant flow of market information relating to current prices. Options (1), (2), and (4) are <br/>incorrect because they are not reasons that this sub-market is considered more perfect than others. <br/></p>
<p>Question 325 <br/>Answer: 4 <br/>Option (4) is correct because zoning bylaws are periodically consolidated to include all the amendments that <br/>have been adopted up to the time of that consolidation, but this is not a standard part that is usually included in <br/>the bylaw. Options (1), (2), and (3) are incorrect because they are all part of a standard zoning bylaw.  <br/></p>
<p>Question 326 <br/>Answer: 4 <br/>Calculate the monthly principal and interest that can be paid from the given constraints and the following <br/>equation: PIT = GDSR &#61512; Gross Income  <br/> <br/></p>

<p> <br/>The monthly allowable amount for principal and interest is $250. </p>


<p>Question 327 <br/>Answer: 2 <br/>Option (2) is correct because the seller&#8217;s share of the property taxes will reduce the cash proceeds due to <br/>him/her, and thus will be debited on his/her statement of adjustments. Option (1) is incorrect because taxes are <br/>apportioned between the parties as of the adjustment date and this is reflected on the statements of <br/>adjustments. Option (3) is incorrect because taxes may be paid out of the proceeds where taxes are due but have <br/>not yet been paid, whereas in this situation the taxes are not yet due. Option (4) is incorrect because a credit on <br/>the buyer&#8217;s statement of adjustments would reflect an amount that was owed to the seller, and in this situation <br/>the seller&#8217;s share of the taxes are owed to the buyer so that the buyer can pay them in the future when they <br/>become due. <br/></p>

<p>Question 329 <br/>Answer: 1 <br/>Option (1) is correct because the developer is offering below-market rate financing as an incentive to sell more <br/>condos. Therefore, Options (2), (3), and (4) are incorrect. </p>


<p>Question 330 <br/>Answer: 4 <br/>Find the market value of a loan contract given the change in the market rate; add the down payment to obtain <br/>the market value of the offer. <br/> <br/>Press Display <br/>4 &#61568; NOM% 4 <br/>2 &#61568; P/YR 2 <br/>&#61568; EFF% 4.04 <br/>12 &#61568; P/YR 12 <br/>&#61568; NOM%  3.967068 <br/>125000 PV 125,000 <br/>240 N 240 <br/>0 FV 0 <br/>PMT  &#61473;755.308081 <br/>755.31 +/&#61473; PMT &#61473;755.31 <br/>6.5 &#61568; NOM% 6.5 <br/>2 &#61568; P/YR 2 <br/>&#61568; EFF%  6.605625 <br/>12 &#61568; P/YR 12 <br/>&#61568; NOM% 6.413688 <br/>PV  101,999.942524 (market value of the mortgage) <br/>+ 75000 = 176,999.942524 (market value of the offer) <br/> <br/>The market value of the offer is $176,999.94. <br/></p>

<p>Question 332 <br/>Answer: 1 <br/>Option (1) is correct because an invitation to treat is an invitation to the public to submit offers. Option (2) is <br/>incorrect because a legal offer is meant to be binding if accepted, whereas an invitation to treat is not an offer <br/>capable of acceptance to form a binding contract. For this reason, Option (4) is also incorrect. Option (3) is <br/>incorrect because a request for information is not sufficient to constitute an invitation to treat; rather, a request <br/>for offers is required. <br/></p>
<p>Question 333 <br/>Answer: 3 <br/>Option (3) is correct because the subject of a real property appraisal is the legal interest of ownership vested in <br/>the land. A legal interest in cattle is not a legal interest of ownership vested in the land. Options (1), (2), and (4) <br/>are incorrect because they are all legal interests of ownership vested in the land. <br/></p>
<p>Question 334 <br/>Answer: 3 <br/>Option (3) is correct because an exclusive listing is an &#8216;exclusive right to sell&#8217; which gives the real estate <br/>brokerage (through its Designated Agent) the sole authority to sell the property for a specified period. Option (1) <br/>is incorrect because an open listing authorizes a real estate brokerage through its Designated Agent to sell the <br/>property; however, it does not prevent the seller from employing a number of other brokerages to also <br/>represent the seller through their Designated Agents. Option (2) is incorrect because a general listing is another <br/>name for an open listing. Option (4) is incorrect because a restricted listing is not a type of real estate agency <br/>listing contract. <br/></p>
<p>Question 335 <br/>Answer: 4 <br/>Option (4) is correct because the document grants a right of way, which is a form of easement, to Mary for the <br/>benefit of her land (the dominant tenement) over John&#8217;s land (the servient tenement). Option (1) is incorrect <br/>because a restrictive covenant imposes a restriction on the use of one person&#8217;s land for the benefit of another, <br/>and this document grants a positive right to use the land rather than a restriction. Option (2) is incorrect <br/>because a lease grants a right to possession for a certain amount of time, whereas this interest does not have an <br/>end date attached to it and it does not grant exclusive possession to the property. Option (3) is incorrect because <br/>a license is a privilege to enter onto premises for a certain purpose that is a personal right (i.e. can only be <br/>exercised by the person to whom it was granted) whereas this right is an interest which runs with the property <br/>rather than to Mary exclusively. <br/></p>
<p>Question 336 <br/>Answer: 3 <br/>Option (3) is correct because in using the cost approach of appraisal, the major difficulty is experienced in <br/>calculating incurable physical depreciation. The cause of the difficulty lies in determining the economic life of <br/>the building. Options (1), (2), and (4) are incorrect for this reason. <br/></p>
<p>Question 337 <br/>Answer: 2 <br/>Option (2) is correct because if supply and demand factors have remained relatively stable for the last 3 months, <br/>a good comparable property is a similar property that sold one week ago, after two months exposure to the <br/>market. This is the best comparable because the comparative approach is built on the premise that the market <br/>value of the subject property will be equal to the prices recently paid for similar properties. Options (1) and (4) <br/>are incorrect because they do not represent the market value of similar properties. Option (3) is incorrect <br/>because this similar property has not sold. </p>


<p>Question 338 <br/>Answer: 1 <br/>Option (1) is correct because to find the adjusted sale price of the comparable, take the sum of the listed sale <br/>price with its adjustments to the subject property. In this case, the subject property and the comparable are <br/>identical except that the subject property has 1 additional bedroom and is 100 square feet larger. The adjusted <br/>sale price is: $321,000 + $3,200 + $5,000 = $329,200. <br/></p>
<p>Question 339 <br/>Answer: 3 <br/>Option (3) is correct because reproduction cost is the current cost of constructing an exact replica of the subject <br/>property. Options (1), (2), and (4) are incorrect for this reason. <br/></p>
<p>Question 340 <br/>Answer: 2 <br/>Option (2) is correct (FALSE) because a binding contract of purchase and sale can be created if there is an offer, <br/>acceptance, and consideration. The exchange of promises to convey title to the property in return for the <br/>purchase price is valid consideration, even without a deposit. Options (1), (3), and (4) are incorrect because they <br/>are TRUE statements. <br/></p>
<p>Question 341 <br/>Answer: 3 <br/>Option (3) is correct because an ordinary residential property is assessed at market (actual) value. Option (1) is <br/>incorrect because it would qualify as a special residential property and could be assessed according to the value <br/>based solely on the current residential use. Option (2) is incorrect because pipelines are classified under Major <br/>Industry property and are assessed on a separate basis due to difficulty in determining actual value. Option (4) <br/>is incorrect because for real estate classified as farm land, the assessor must consider only the value of the <br/>property as a farm and exclude value attributable to any other potential uses (i.e. value in use is considered <br/>rather than actual value). <br/></p>

<p>Question 344 <br/>Answer: 1 <br/>Option (1) is correct because all things being equal, a longer term on a bonused partially amortized loan will <br/>result in a lower effective interest rate paid by the borrower. This is because the value of the bonus is paid off <br/>over a longer term, thus decreasing the annual cost of borrowing. Options (2), (3), and (4) are incorrect for this <br/>reason. <br/></p>

However, calculations are <br/>not required. Given the inverse relationship between the present value and interest rates, since the present <br/>value declines (all else constant), the interest rate increases (as supported by the above calculations). </p>


<p>Question 346 <br/>Answer: 4 <br/>Option (4) is correct because the objectivity principle states that all accounting information needs to be <br/>objectively determined, as well as verifiable. Option (1) is incorrect because the consistency principle states that <br/>once an accounting policy is adopted, the company must continue to use the same policy in the future. Option <br/>(2) is incorrect because the verification principle is not a generally accepted accounting principle. Option (3) is <br/>incorrect because the materiality principle is not studied in this course. <br/></p>
<p>Question 347 <br/>Answer: 2 <br/>Option (2) is correct because increasing the interest rate is a way to accommodate increased risk by providing <br/>increased return for the lender, but this does not reduce the risk. In fact, a higher interest rate will result in a <br/>higher payment, making the risk of default even greater. Options (1), (3), and (4) are incorrect because they <br/>represent ways that a lender can reduce risk. <br/></p>
<p>Question 348 <br/>Answer: 1 <br/>Option (1) is correct because where acceptance is intended to be by non-instantaneous means, which includes <br/>by post, the acceptance is effective when it is put in the mail rather than when it is actually received. If the <br/>acceptance is lost in the mail, there is still a binding contract as long as the offeree can prove the acceptance was <br/>actually mailed. For these reasons, Options (2), (3), and (4) are incorrect. <br/></p>
<p>Question 349 <br/>Answer: 4 <br/>Option (4) is correct because there is no requirement for developers to consult with the public over proposed <br/>developments under the Real Estate Development Marketing Act (REDMA). Options (1), (2), and (3) are incorrect <br/>because developers are required to do each of these things under REDMA. Its purpose is to protect purchasers <br/>by requiring developers who market or intend to market development units in development properties to: meet <br/>any preliminary requirements or approvals applicable to the type of property to be marketed; ensure <br/>appropriate steps are taken to pay the cost of utilities or other related services and to assure the purchaser&#8217;s title <br/>(or other interest) upon purchase; and prepare and file a disclosure option in the form required by the BC <br/>Financial Services Authority. <br/></p>
<p>Question 350 <br/>Answer: 2 <br/>Option (2) is correct because an owner cannot file a lien against the strata corporation because they are <br/>dissatisfied with the corporation&#8217;s actions. However, if an owner sues a strata corporation and succeeds, they <br/>may receive a judgment against the strata corporation. Options (1), (3), and (4) are incorrect because they are all <br/>remedies available under the Strata Property Act to an owner who is dissatisfied with acts of the strata <br/>corporation. <br/></p>
<p>Question 351 <br/>Answer: 3 <br/>Option (3) is correct because a licensee is required to file a Suspicious Transaction Report (STR) as soon as <br/>practicable. Option (1) is incorrect because individual licensees have an obligation under the Proceeds of Crime <br/>(Money Laundering) and Terrorist Financing Act to file STRs, whether or not the managing broker approves. <br/>Option (2) is incorrect because law enforcement direction is not required to file an STR. Option (4) is incorrect <br/>because it is the requirement for filing a Large Cash Transaction Report. There is no specified number of days <br/>required for filing an STR, because the requirement is that it be filed as soon as practicable. </p>


<p>Question 352 <br/>Answer: 4 <br/> Option (4) is correct because in British Columbia, only fee simple owners are protected by the guarantee of <br/>indefeasibility. In Gill v. Bucholtz (2009) the British Columbia Court of Appeal confirmed that the Land Tile Act <br/>preserves the common law principle that &#8220;one cannot give another person that property which one does not <br/>have&#8221; with respect to registered charges. Options (1) and (3) are incorrect because under British Columbia&#8217;s <br/>Torrens system, the indefeasibility principle provides that when a person is named on a certificate of title as the <br/>owner of the fee simple estate in land, that is conclusive proof that he or she is entitled to that fee simple estate. <br/>Therefore, a fee simple owner cannot recover title from a good faith purchaser who acquires fee simple title by <br/>way of a void deed. Option (2) is incorrect because nemo dat quod non habet is the fundamental common law <br/>tenet that one cannot give what one does not have, which would protect the rightful owner. The indefeasibility <br/>principle protects the registered fee simple owner.  <br/></p>
<p>Question 353 <br/>Answer: 4 <br/>Option (4) is the correct answer as reconciling the market value of the subject property is not a reason to include <br/>a market analysis in the appraisal report. Options (1), (2) and (3) are incorrect because they are valid reasons to <br/>include the market analysis in the appraisal report. <br/></p>
<p>Question 354 <br/>Answer: 2 <br/>Option (2) is correct because an agent is a person authorized to act on behalf of another person, the principal, so <br/>that they represent the principal in dealings with third parties. Therefore, while the agent is acting within the <br/>scope of his authority as an agent and after having disclosed that he is an agent for the principal, the contract <br/>will be between the principal for whom the agent is acting and the third party. Option (1) is incorrect because, <br/>although there would be a contract between the agent and the principal in order to establish the agency <br/>relationship, in this case the contract is with a third party. Options (3) and (4) are incorrect because the agent is <br/>acting on behalf of the principal as if he were stepping into the principal&#8217;s shoes rather than contracting for <br/>himself; therefore, the agent is not party to the agreement.  <br/></p>
<p>Question 355 <br/>Answer: 3 <br/>Option (3) is correct because a sub-lease is a lease by the original tenant (the sub-landlord) to a third party for <br/>less than the total remainder of the sub-landlord&#8217;s original lease term. Option (1) is incorrect because an <br/>assignment is the transfer by a party of all of the party&#8217;s interest in a property, i.e. for the total remainder of the <br/>lease term rather than a portion of it. Option (2) is incorrect because a tenancy by sufferance occurs when there <br/>is no tenancy because no lease exists. For example, if a tenant does not move out of the leased premises upon <br/>the expiration of the term of the lease. Option (4) is incorrect because a tenancy at will is where the tenant, with <br/>the consent of the landlord, occupies land as a tenant for a term which can be terminated by either party at any <br/>time. <br/></p>
<p>Question 356 <br/>Answer: 1 <br/>Option (1) is correct because where property taxes are to be paid in the future by the buyer, the seller owes the <br/>share of taxes from January 1 up to the adjustment date, in this case, up to April 14 as the adjustment date is <br/>April 15. Option (2) is incorrect because taxes are split according to the proportion of the year that each party <br/>has ownership of the property rather than an equal split. Option (3) is incorrect because Benson is responsible <br/>for paying taxes on July 1. Vanessa will have to pay Benson for her share of taxes from January 1 through April <br/>14. Option (4) is incorrect because the property taxes will have to be paid regardless of when the sale completes. </p>


<p>Question 357 <br/>Answer: 2 <br/>Option (2) is correct because the statement of profit and loss, also known as the income statement, measures <br/>revenues and expenses for a certain time period. Option (1) is incorrect because there is no financial statement <br/>that reflects the acquisition of assets of a certain period of time. Option (3) is incorrect because there is no <br/>financial statement that measures the revenues accrued at a single point in time. Option (4) is incorrect because <br/>the balance sheet is the financial statement that measures the assets and liabilities held at a single point in time. <br/></p>
<p>Question 358 <br/>Answer: 1 <br/>Option (1) is correct because the estate in fee simple is the greatest estate in Canadian law, equivalent to what <br/>we ordinarily think of as outright ownership of real property, where the owner has rights to the land for so long <br/>as he or she has heirs. This includes the right to freely use and enjoy it, sell it, rent or lease it, grant mortgages or <br/>easements or other interests in land, and to dispose of it under the terms of a will. Options (2) and (4) are <br/>incorrect because leasehold estates and estates pur autre vie are estates in land less than fee simple since the <br/>interests have a prescribed end date and other conditions or obligations attached to the use and enjoyment of <br/>the land. Option (3) is incorrect because an easement is an interest in land less than an estate as it is a limited <br/>right to use another&#8217;s land rather than a full right to possession of the property.  <br/></p>
<p>Question 359 <br/>Answer: 2 <br/>Option (2) is the correct answer because the value to owner cannot be used in appraisal, but may be used in <br/>investment analysis. Options (1), (3), and (4) are incorrect for this reason. <br/></p>
<p>Question 360 <br/>Answer: 3 <br/>Option (3) is correct because the shopping behaviour model classifies products and services based on the <br/>amount of effort that a consumer is willing to go through to obtain that product or service. In order of the <br/>amount of effort required by the consumer, from the least effort to the most effort, the goods are unsought <br/>goods, convenience goods, shopping goods, and specialty goods. Options (1), (2), and (4) are incorrect for this <br/>reason. <br/></p>
<p>Question 361 <br/>Answer: 4 <br/>Option (4) is correct because niche marketing focuses on a relatively small but active and growing target <br/>market. Option (1) is incorrect because undifferentiated marketing is when a single product or service is <br/>marketed to all potential consumers with a single marketing program. Option (2) is incorrect because <br/>differentiated marketing refers to numerous similar products being marketed to different market segments <br/>using different marketing programs. Option (3) is incorrect because specialty marketing is a term not used in <br/>this course. </p>


<p>Question 362 <br/>Answer: 1 <br/>For this question you are given the monthly periodic rate and asked to calculate how many years Joanne will <br/>make payments. First, express the rate as a j12, then calculate N. <br/> <br/>Press Display <br/>.5 &#61512; 12 = I/YR 6 <br/>12 &#61568; P/YR 12 <br/>15000 PV 15,000 <br/>450 +/&#61473;PMT &#61473;450 <br/>0 FV 0 <br/>N  36.555396 <br/>&#247; 12 = 3.046283 <br/> <br/>N is expressed as months; therefore, divide by 12 to express the amortization in years. Joanne will have to make <br/>payments for three full years.  <br/></p>
<p>Question 363 <br/>Answer: 3 <br/>Option (3) is correct because a listing licensee has a duty to verify information for the listing and may be liable if <br/>they fail to do so and the buyers incur damages as a result. Options (1), (2), and (4) are incorrect because they <br/>would not meet the licensee&#8217;s duty to independently check the information provided to them by the seller <br/>where possible. <br/></p>
<p>Question 364 <br/>Answer: 4 <br/>Option (4) is correct because a tenant under a commercial lease may assign without the consent of the landlord <br/>unless there is an express prohibition in the lease. Options (1), (2), and (3) are incorrect because the <br/>presumption is that assignment is allowed unless otherwise specified in the lease, and none of the situations in <br/>these options are required for the presumption to prevail. <br/></p>
<p>Question 365 <br/>Answer: 1 <br/>Option (1) is correct because under the Real Estate Development Marketing Act, a new disclosure statement is <br/>required when the identity of the developer changes. A developer is defined as a person who, directly or <br/>indirectly owns, leases or has a right to acquire or dispose of development property, subject to exclusion by <br/>regulation. Therefore, the bank would be considered a new developer and would have to file a new disclosure <br/>statement. For this reason, Options (2) and (3) are incorrect. Option (4) is incorrect because there is no <br/>requirement to file a prospectus rather than a disclosure statement in the event of a foreclosure. <br/></p>
<p>Question 366 <br/>Answer: 2 <br/>Option (2) is correct because, in the income approach of appraisal, the market value for any particular real <br/>estate property is determined by the yields that prospective purchasers reasonably expect to earn. Options (1), <br/>(3), and (4) are true and are therefore incorrect. </p>


<p>Question 367 <br/>Answer: 3 <br/>Option (3) is correct because &#8220;identify the proposal&#8221; is not one of the 10 privacy principles provided for under <br/>the Personal Information Protection Act (PIPA). Option (1) is incorrect because Principle 10 is to provide <br/>recourse. Option (2) is incorrect because Principle 2 is to obtain consent. Option (4) is incorrect because <br/>Principle 5 provides for limiting use, disclosure, and retention.  <br/></p>
<p>Question 368 <br/>Answer: 3 <br/>Option (3) is correct because the debt coverage ratio is calculated by dividing the annual net operating income <br/>by the annual sum of mortgage payments. Options (1), (2), and (4) are incorrect for this reason. <br/></p>
<p>Question 369 <br/>Answer: 2 <br/>Option (2) is correct because a counter-offer terminates the original offer to become the new offer. Option (1) is <br/>incorrect because if the counteroffer is not accepted, the offeree cannot accept the first offer because it has <br/>already terminated. Option (3) is incorrect because a counter-offer does not terminate all negotiations, just the <br/>original offer. Option (4) is incorrect because a counter-offer does not have the effect of accepting the original <br/>offer but rather suggests new terms. <br/></p>
<p>Question 370 <br/>Answer: 4 <br/>Option (4) is correct because Options (1), (2), and (3) all constitute events which will end an agency relationship. <br/>If a principal revokes the authority of the agent orally or by conduct, the agency will be terminated. An event <br/>which frustrates the continuation of the agency contract would also terminate the relationship. Finally, once an <br/>agent has performed the actions for which he or she was given authority in the agency contract, the agency <br/>relationship will be over as an agent cannot act outside his or her scope of authority. <br/></p>
<p>Question 371 <br/>Answer: 2 <br/>Find the present value of the perpetual net operating income given the market capitalization rate of 9.5%. <br/></p>

<p>Question 372 <br/>Answer: 3 <br/>Option (3) is correct because the two types of damages recognized in the case of a private nuisance are <br/>unreasonable interference with another occupier&#8217;s use and enjoyment of property, and interference which <br/>causes physical damage to the property. Option (1) is incorrect because the courts have held that it is no defence <br/>to a nuisance action to say that the plaintiff came to the nuisance. Option (2) is incorrect because the standard <br/>against which reasonableness is measured is that of the average reasonable person, and it is not relevant that a <br/>plaintiff happens to be unusually sensitive unless the defendant seeks to take advantage of that fact. Option (4) <br/>is incorrect because the person who creates the nuisance (in this case, Schroeder) is liable for creating it, and in <br/>a landlord and tenant situation, the tenant occupier is primarily liable for nuisances created on the property. </p>


<p>Question 373 <br/>Answer: 3 <br/>Option (3) is correct because an interest accruing loan poses a high risk to the lender, since the entire amount of <br/>principal and interest is outstanding for the entire length of the term. Due to this, these loans are typically <br/>written for short terms. Option (1) is incorrect because although it is a true statement, it is not the reason <br/>interest accruing loans are written for short terms. Options (2) and (4) are incorrect because they are false <br/>statements. <br/></p>
<p>Question 374 <br/>Answer: 1  <br/>Sue purchases the townhouse for $145,000 (present value) and sells the townhouse in 7 years for $190,000 <br/>(future value).

<p>Question 375 <br/>Answer: 3 <br/>Option (3) is correct because a time clause in a contract for purchase and sale of land allows a party to invoke a <br/>time period in which a condition precedent must be removed, where the right to invoke the clause arises on the <br/>vendor receiving another offer after entering the original contract of purchase and sale. Option (1) is incorrect <br/>because it must be for a specified time period, not just a &#8220;reasonable time.&#8221; Option (2) is incorrect because the <br/>date by which the condition precedent must be removed depends on the vendor receiving another offer, and so <br/>the time period is set out in the contract during which the condition must be removed rather than a specified <br/>date. Option (4) is incorrect because Option (3) correctly describes a time clause. </p>

<p> <br/>With an interest only loan, all periodic payments until the end of the term of the loan are interest payments and <br/>are identical. Carolyn will make quarterly interest only payments of $1,800.  <br/></p>
<p>Question 377 <br/>Answer: 4 <br/>Option (4) is correct because the Local Government Act provides that subdivision bylaws created by municipal <br/>councils may regulate the location, width, alignment and grade of highways and may also require that the <br/>subdivider provide street lighting and underground (as well as wiring, water, sewer and drainage systems, fire <br/>hydrants, and roads) within the subdivision. Options (1), (2), and (3) are incorrect because they are outside of <br/>the scope of what bylaws created by municipal council are permitted to regulate with regard to the subdivision <br/>of land. <br/></p>
<p>Question 378 <br/>Answer: 2 <br/>Option (2) is the correct answer as it is the only option that is not represented by interest received by a lender. <br/>Interest due or paid represents the cost of financing debt, not interest received. Options (1), (3), and (4) all <br/>represent interest charged on a mortgage and are therefore incorrect.  <br/></p>
<p>Question 379 <br/>Answer: 1 <br/>Option (1) is correct because under section 40 of the Rules, when a licensee advertises real estate, the name of <br/>the brokerage must be displayed in a prominent and easily readable way. Options (2), (3), and (4) are not <br/>provided for under the Real Estate Services Act and are therefore incorrect. <br/></p>
<p>Question 380 <br/>Answer: 3 <br/>Option (3) is correct because real property taxes are a component of operating expenses, which are deducted <br/>from gross realized income to arrive at net operating income when preparing an appraisal using the income <br/>approach. Options (1), (2), and (4) are incorrect because income tax, interest on a mortgage, and depreciation <br/>expense are not included in operating expenses and do not factor into the calculation of net operating income. </p>


<p>Question 381 <br/>Answer: 3 <br/>Option (3) is correct because a periodic tenancy is one which automatically renews itself on the last day of the <br/>term for a further term of the same length until it is terminated by either party with proper notice. Option (1) is <br/>incorrect because a tenancy at will is a tenancy where a tenant, with the consent of the landlord, occupies land <br/>for a term which can be terminated by either party at any time. Option (2) is incorrect because a tenancy at <br/>sufferance occurs when there is no tenancy because no lease exists, for example, if a tenant does not move out <br/>of the leased premises upon the expiration of the term of the lease. Option (4) is incorrect because a fixed term <br/>tenancy has a predetermined date at which the tenancy expires. <br/></p>

<p>Question 384 <br/>Answer: 1  <br/>Option (1) is correct (and therefore Options (2), (3), and (4) are incorrect) because distinguishing a case occurs <br/>when a judge decides the factual circumstance of the case at hand is not similar enough to the former decision <br/>to warrant following the judgment, and therefore the decision will not be binding on the judge.  <br/></p>
<p>Question 385 <br/>Answer: 2  <br/>A charge is any interest in land less than a fee simple. Rights of way, liens, mortgages, and easements are all <br/>examples of charges. Option (2) is correct because an easement is a type of interest in land less than a fee simple <br/>that can be registered under the Land Title Act and thus may appear on a Certificate of Title as a charge. <br/>Options (1), (3) and (4) are incorrect because while indications of all of these circumstances may appear on a <br/>Certificate of Title, none of them necessarily indicate an estate or interest in land, and so they do not constitute <br/>a charge.  <br/></p>
<p>Question 386 <br/>Answer: 2 <br/>Option (2) is correct because land is never depreciated, so the purchase price is $180,000. Options (1), (3), and (4) <br/>are therefore incorrect. </p>


<p>Question 387 <br/>Answer: 4 <br/>Option (4) is correct because rent receivable is the only option that would not be found in the current liabilities <br/>section. Current liabilities are those debts that are expected to be repaid within the next year, and rent <br/>receivable is not a debt that is payable, it is an asset that is receivable. Options (1), (2), and (3) are incorrect <br/>because they are all current liabilities. <br/></p>
<p>Question 388 <br/>Answer: 4 <br/>Option (4) is correct (and Options (1), (2), and (3) are incorrect) because the Assessment Act states that factors <br/>which the assessor may consider in determining actual value include: present use, location, original cost, <br/>replacement cost, revenue or rental value, selling price of the land and improvements and comparable land <br/>improvements, economic and functional obsolescence, and any other circumstances affecting value.  <br/></p>
<p>Question 389 <br/>Answer: 4 <br/>Option (4) is correct because deposits for real estate transactions are 5-10% of the total purchase price, so a <br/>deposit of 50% as liquidated damages will likely not be enforced by the courts since it would not be a <br/>reasonable pre-estimate of damages. Option (1) is incorrect because the courts will award specific performance <br/>to the seller if damages are considered to be an inadequate remedy. Options (2) and (3) are incorrect because <br/>the court will award damages to any party who can prove that he or she has suffered loss as a result of a breach <br/>of contract so as to return them to the position they would have been in had the contract been performed as <br/>promised. <br/></p>
<p>Question 390 <br/>Answer: 2 <br/>Option (2) is correct because the Real Estate Services Act does not give the British Columbia Financial Services <br/>Authority (BFCSA) the power to investigate breaches of the REALTOR&#63194; Code. The REALTOR&#63194; Code is a <br/>professional ethical code that has been developed by the Canadian Real Estate Association and is enforced by <br/>local real estate boards, not BCFSA. Options (1), (3), and (4) are incorrect because section the Real Estate Services <br/>Act empowers BCFSA to conduct an investigation to determine whether a licensee has committed professional <br/>misconduct, and wrongful taking or deceptive dealing; contravention of the Act, the Regulations or Rules; and <br/>incompetence in performing any activity for which a license is required all amount to professional misconduct <br/>under section 35 of the Real Estate Services Act. <br/></p>
<p>Question 391 <br/>Answer: 4 <br/>Option (4) is correct because the acceleration clause is a term in the contract which brings the maturity date of <br/>the loan forward if the borrower defaults, so that the outstanding balance is immediately due and payable. <br/>Option (1) is incorrect because the repayment clause states that the full amount outstanding is due and payable <br/>on a fixed date after the loan is made (i.e. it sets the maturity date, which can be brought forward by the <br/>acceleration clause in the case of default). Option (2) is incorrect because the personal covenant is the personal <br/>contractual promise made by the mortgagor to pay the mortgage money and interest of the mortgage. Option <br/>(3) is incorrect because the omnibus clause gives the lender an alternative to accelerating the loan if the <br/>borrower defaults. </p>


<p>Question 392 <br/>Answer: 2 <br/>Option (2) is correct because the commission is paid by the seller only, and so it would appear as a debit to the <br/>seller (reducing the amount of cash proceeds of sale due to the seller) and the buyer&#8217;s statement would not be <br/>affected. Because of this, Option (4) is incorrect. Option (1) is incorrect because taxes will appear as a credit on <br/>the buyer&#8217;s statement of adjustments and a debit on the seller&#8217;s statement of adjustments in the case that taxes <br/>are to be paid in the future by the buyer. Option (3) is incorrect because, although it is true that conveyancing <br/>fees would appear on the buyer&#8217;s statement of adjustments as a debit, the fees would not be included in the <br/>seller&#8217;s statement of adjustments. <br/></p>
<p>Question 393 <br/>Answer: 3 <br/>Option (3) is false. Individual borrowers, not corporations, have the right, under the terms of the Interest Act, to <br/>prepay all of the outstanding balance at any time after five years from the initiation date of the mortgage. The <br/>calculations for Options (1) and (2) are as follows: <br/> <br/>(1) Solving for payment: <br/> <br/>Press Display <br/>12.75 &#61568; NOM% 12.75 <br/>2 &#61568; P/YR 2 <br/>&#61568; EFF% 13.156406 <br/>4 &#61568; P/YR 4 <br/>&#61568; NOM% 12.553027 <br/>1450000 PV 1,450,000 <br/>20 &#61512; 4 = N 80 <br/>0 FV 0 <br/>PMT  &#61473;49,700.134749 <br/> <br/>The payment is $49,701, rounded to the next higher dollar. Option (1) is true. <br/> <br/>(2) To solve the outstanding balance at the end of the term (10 years), re-enter the rounded payment and then <br/>can calculate the OSB. The calculator steps continue as follows: <br/> <br/>49701 +/&#61473; PMT &#61473;49,701 <br/>10 &#61512; 4 = INPUT &#61568; AMORT PER 40-40 <br/>= = =  1,123,491.83788 <br/> <br/>This shows that the outstanding balance immediately following the 40th payment is $1,123,491.84, which is <br/>less than $1,123,500. Therefore, Option (2) is a true statement. Option (4) is also a true statement; the lender has <br/>no right to demand payment of the total outstanding balance at any time prior to the end of the contractual <br/>term provided the borrower meets all contractual obligations.  </p>

<p>Question 395 <br/>Answer: 4 <br/>Option (4) is correct (false) because the standard bylaws do not allow the strata council to pass rules with respect <br/>to the safety and cleanliness of individually owned strata lots &#8211; they can only do so with respect to the common <br/>property. Options (1), (2), and (3) are all incorrect because they are true statements. <br/></p>
<p>Question 396 <br/>Answer: 3 <br/>Option (3) is correct because the names of individual shareholders are not included on a corporation&#8217;s balance <br/>sheet because this could represent anywhere from one shareholder to millions of shareholders. Option (1) is <br/>incorrect because the shareholders&#8217; equity section of the balance sheet does list the number of shares issued <br/>and outstanding. Option (2) is incorrect because the original cost of property owned by the corporation (i.e., its <br/>assets) is listed on the balance sheet. Option (4) is incorrect because retained earnings to date are also listed on <br/>the balance sheet. <br/></p>
<p>Question 397 <br/>Answer: 2 <br/>Option (2) is correct because it correctly describes a method that a licensee can use to identify an individual. <br/>Option (1) is incorrect because when using government-issued photo identification to identify an individual, <br/>the licensee must either examine the document in person, or virtually through sophisticated software that will <br/>analyze its security features. Videoconferencing will not meet this requirement. Option (3) is incorrect because <br/>the government-issued photo identification must be valid and current, and an expired driver&#8217;s licence, even if it <br/>has only been expired for a short period of time, will not meet this requirement. Option (4) is incorrect because <br/>an offshore financial entity is not considered a reliable source for the purposes of the dual process method of <br/>identification. <br/></p>
<p>Question 398 <br/>Answer: 4 <br/>Option (4) is correct (and Options (1), (2), and (3) are incorrect) because section 19(1) of the Infants Act provides <br/>that a contract entered into by an infant will be unenforceable against the infant unless another statute <br/>provides that the contract is enforceable, the infant affirms the contract after turning 19, the infant performs or <br/>partially performs the contract after turning 19, or the infant does not repudiate the contract within one year of <br/>turning 19. </p>


<p>Question 399 <br/>Answer: 2 <br/>Option (2) is correct because the income approach is generally only used to for income-generating investment <br/>properties. Single-family residences are generally not income-generating investment properties, and are more <br/>frequently owner occupied. Options (1), (3), (4) are incorrect because the income approach is more often used <br/>for warehouses, leasehold interests, and apartment buildings. <br/></p>
<p>Question 400 <br/>Answer: 4 <br/>Option (4) is correct because apparent authority results where a reasonable third party would consider, from <br/>the conduct or statements of the principal and agent, that the agent did, in fact, possess authority. Option (1) is <br/>incorrect because actual authority refers to the authority given to the agent by the principal in their agency <br/>agreement and includes express authority, implied authority, and customary authority. Option (2) is incorrect <br/>because express authority is the authority created by the terms of the agency contract and does not need to be <br/>implied by acts of the parties. Option (3) is incorrect because legal authority is not a recognized category of <br/>agency (although the terms of the agency agreement could include giving the agent authority to make legal <br/>decisions).  <br/></p>
<p>Question 401 <br/>Answer: 3 <br/>Option (3) is correct because each strata owner jointly owns the common property of the strata development, <br/>and the Schedule of Unit Entitlement determines each owner&#8217;s proportionate, undivided ownership share as a <br/>tenant in common of the common property in the strata plan. Option (4) is incorrect for the same reason. <br/>Option (1) is incorrect because the owner-developer is not a trustee for the individual strata lot owners. Option <br/>(2) is incorrect because, although the strata corporation exercises exclusive control over the common property, <br/>it is still owned jointly by the individual strata lot owners. <br/></p>
<p>Question 402 <br/>Answer: 2 <br/>Option (2) is correct because a borrower is normally charged the costs of preparing and registering a new first <br/>mortgage. Option (1) is incorrect because the seller is responsible for the full amount of any penalty; it is not <br/>adjusted because only the seller was liable to pay and failed to do so in a timely manner. Option (3) is incorrect <br/>because taxes up until the possession date are owed by the seller; the buyer is only responsible for taxes from <br/>the possession date until December 31. Option (4) is incorrect because the commission is normally paid by the <br/>seller. <br/></p>
<p>Question 403 <br/>Answer: 4 <br/>Option (4) is correct (and Options (1), (2), and (3) are incorrect) because under section 53 of the Rules, where a <br/>licensee is acquiring real estate, disclosure must be made to the other party before the agreement is entered into <br/>by providing them with the Disclosure of Interest in Trade form, which includes an indication that the licensee <br/>is licensed under RESA, the terms under which the real estate is to be resold (where applicable), and the amount <br/>of remuneration or other money that is anticipated to be received by the licensee.  <br/></p>
<p>Question 404 <br/>Answer: 3 <br/>Option (3) is correct because when using the cost approach of appraisal to estimate the value of a building that <br/>contains urea formaldehyde foam insulation (UFFI), insulation should be considered in your calculation as <br/>part of the overall replacement costs and as a deduction for depreciation. Option (3) is incorrect for this reason. <br/>Options (1) and (4) are incorrect because insulation would not be a part of the land/site value.  </p>

<p>Question 406 <br/>Answer: 4 <br/>Option (4) is correct because an agreement for sale is a purchase agreement whereby the purchaser agrees to <br/>pay the purchase price of the property (usually with a down payment plus monthly payments of principal and <br/>interest) directly to the seller. Option (1) is incorrect because under a mortgage the title is registered to the <br/>purchaser and the vendor&#8217;s mortgage is registered as a charge, while in an agreement for sale the vendor <br/>remains on the title as registered owner and promises to execute a transfer as soon as the final payment is <br/>made. Option (2) is incorrect because an agreement of purchase and sale is a contract for the purchase of land <br/>which contains the obligations of the vendor and purchaser with respect to the transaction. Option (3) is <br/>incorrect because the equity of redemption is the mortgagor&#8217;s right to repay the mortgage and regain title even <br/>after the contractual date for repayment has passed. <br/></p>
<p>Question 407 <br/>Answer: 3 <br/>Option (3) is correct and can be illustrated by way of example. A loan with an interest rate of 5% compounded <br/>annually will yield a $5 return at the end of the year for a $100 investment. If it was a nominal rate of 5%, <br/>compounded semi-annually, the yield would be $5.06025 (a 5.06025% effective rate). Therefore, increasing the <br/>compounding period increases the yield to the lender. Options (1), (2), and (4) are incorrect for this reason. <br/></p>
<p>Question 408  <br/>Answer: 2 <br/>Option (2) is correct as remuneration that is to be received as money must be expressed as a dollar amount in <br/>the Disclosure of Expected Remuneration (Payment) form. Options (1), (3), and (4) are incorrect for this reason. <br/></p>
<p>Question 409 <br/>Answer: 1 <br/>Option (1) is correct because the shareholders&#8217; equity section on a corporation&#8217;s balance sheet is made up of two <br/>accounts: share capital and retained earnings. Options (2) and (3) are incorrect because this section does not <br/>include dividends. Option (4) is incorrect because net income is already accounted for within the retained <br/>earnings account.  <br/></p>
<p>Question 410 <br/>Answer: 3 <br/>Option (3) is correct because according to the capital cost allowance rules set out by the Canada Revenue <br/>Agency, in the year an asset is disposed of, no CCA deduction is allowed on that asset. In the case of ABC Inc., no <br/>CCA may be claimed at the end of the current year. Options (1), (2), and (4) are therefore incorrect. </p>


<p>Question 411 <br/>Answer: 1 <br/>Option (1) is correct (and Options (2), (3), and (4) are incorrect) because section 25 of the Real Estate Services Act <br/>requires a brokerage to maintain one or more interest bearing trust accounts in British Columbia. <br/></p>
<p>Question 412 <br/>Answer: 1 <br/>Option (1) is correct because where a condition is for the sole benefit of the buyer, the buyer may waive it and <br/>thus the agreement would be binding. Because a binding agreement can be enforced and is not void, Options <br/>(2) and (4) are incorrect. Option (3) is incorrect because the condition was made for the benefit of the buyer, so it <br/>would only be voidable at the option of the buyer, not the seller. <br/></p>
<p>Question 413 <br/>Answer: 1 <br/>Option (1) is correct because an appraisal should not rely on the registered owner as the ultimate source of data <br/>on the property. Instead, the appraiser is often expected to perform his or her own research an analysis. An <br/>appraiser should not make assumptions represented in Options (2), (3), or (4). <br/></p>
<p>Question 414 <br/>Answer: 2 <br/>Find the amount of principal that has been paid off during the 5-year term.  <br/> <br/>Press  Display <br/>12 &#61568; NOM%  12 <br/>2 &#61568; P/YR  2 <br/>&#61568; EFF%  12.36 <br/>12 &#61568; P/YR  12 <br/>&#61568; NOM% 11.710553 <br/>159000 PV 159,000 <br/>20 &#61512; 12 = N  240 <br/>0 FV 0 <br/>PMT &#61473;1,718.748792 <br/>1718.75 +/&#61473; PMT &#61473;1,718.75 <br/>1 INPUT 60 &#61568; AMORT PER 1-60  <br/>=  &#61473;13,541.838497 <br/> <br/>The amount of principal paid off during the 5-year term is $13,541.84. <br/></p>
<p>Question 415 <br/>Answer: 4 <br/>Option (4) is correct because the revocation of an offer must be actually communicated to be effective (the <br/>postal acceptance rule does not apply to revocation). Therefore, the offer is still valid and can be accepted until <br/>the revocation reaches the offeree. Options (1), (2), and (3) are incorrect because the offer is released or expired <br/>in each of those scenarios.  </p>

<p>Question 417 <br/>Answer: 1 <br/>Option (1) is correct because functional depreciation can be defined as the loss in value caused by an outmoded <br/>or inadequate design. Options (2), (3), and (4) are incorrect for this reason. <br/></p>
<p>Question 418 <br/>Answer: 3 <br/>Option (3) is correct because an agent is a person authorized to act on behalf of the principal, so that they <br/>represent the principal in dealings with third parties. Therefore, while the agent is acting within the scope of his <br/>authority as an agent and after having disclosed that he is an agent for the principal, the contract will be <br/>between the principal for whom the agent is acting and the third party. Option (4) is incorrect for the same <br/>reason. Options (1) and (2) are incorrect because the agent is acting on behalf of the principal as if he were <br/>stepping into the principal&#8217;s shoes rather than contracting for himself; therefore, the agent is not party to the <br/>agreement. <br/></p>
<p>Question 419 <br/>Answer: 1 <br/>Option (1) is correct because a landowner owns or has rights in the airspace above his or her property to the <br/>extent that he or she can effectively use it. Options (2) and (3) are incorrect (and Option (4) is therefore also <br/>incorrect) because the fact that an object has entered the boundaries of your property does not give you <br/>ownership rights over it.  </p>


<p>Question 420 <br/>Answer: 3 <br/>Option (3) is correct because specific performance involves the court ordering a party to carry out a specific <br/>action, which the courts will not grant as a remedy for nuisance &#8211; they will only make an order for a party to <br/>stop doing a particular act (i.e. an injunction). Options (1), (2), and (4) are each incorrect because injunctions, <br/>damages, and abatement are all remedies which are potentially available for a private nuisance.  <br/></p>
<p>Question 421 <br/>Answer: 3 <br/>Option (3) is correct because this financial statement is known as the balance sheet. A balance sheet, or <br/>statement of financial position, shows all of the company&#8217;s assets, liabilities, and the equity of the shareholders <br/>at a single point in time. Options (1) and (2) are incorrect because the statement of profit and loss, also known as <br/>the income statement, shows the company&#8217;s revenues and expenses. Option (4) is incorrect because there is no <br/>financial statement known as a corporate statement of holdings. <br/></p>
<p>Question 422 <br/>Answer: 2 <br/>Option (2) is correct because a deposit which is paid directly to a seller (rather than to the brokerage) will appear <br/>as a credit to the buyer and a debit to the seller, because it will reduce the cash proceeds to be received by the <br/>seller upon completion. Because of this, Options (1), (3), and (4) are incorrect. Although a deposit which is paid <br/>to the buyer&#8217;s brokerage will only appear on the buyer&#8217;s statement of adjustments and not the seller&#8217;s, this is not <br/>the case where the deposit is paid directly to a seller.  <br/></p>
<p>Question 423 <br/>Answer: 4 <br/>Option (4) is correct because in relation to the subject property, this comparable has one more bedroom and <br/>one less bathroom. Options (1), (2), and (3) are therefore incorrect. <br/></p>
<p>Question 424 <br/>Answer: 3 <br/>Option (3) is correct because the difference in term has no impact on the monthly payments. Since the loan <br/>amount, interest rate, and amortization period are all the same, the monthly payments will be the same. <br/>Options (1), (2), and (4) are incorrect for this reason. <br/></p>
<p>Question 425 <br/>Answer: 4 <br/>Option (4) is correct because there is no requirement, statutory or common law, that the previous address of the <br/>lessee be included as an essential term of the lease agreement. Options (1), (2), and (3) are incorrect because the <br/>Residential Tenancy Act requires the rent and the date on which the tenancy starts to be included in every <br/>tenancy agreement, and also requires that the agreement be in writing and signed and dated by both the <br/>landlord and tenant.  </p>


<p>Question 426 <br/>Answer: 4 <br/>P + I = (GDSR &#61512; Gross Income) B Property Taxes  <br/>P + I = (0.30 &#61512; $45,000) B $1,500  <br/>P + I = $12,000 per year = $1,000 per month <br/> The mortgage qualifying rate is based on the greater of (1) the government-specified qualifying rate of j2 = <br/>5.25% OR (2) an additional 2% above the mortgage&#8217;s negotiated contract rate. In this case, you would apply a <br/>rate of j2 = 6% (2% + 4%), which is greater than the government-specified rate of j2 = 5.25%.  <br/> <br/>Press Display <br/>6 &#61568; NOM% 6 <br/>2 &#61568; P/YR 2 <br/>&#61568; EFF% 6.09 <br/>12 &#61568; P/YR 12 <br/>&#61568; NOM%  5.926346 <br/>1000 +/&#61473; PMT &#61473;1,000 <br/>240 N 240 <br/>0 FV 0 <br/>PV  140,412.275903 <br/> <br/>Given the stress test borrower qualification rules, the maximum loan that will be granted is $140,412.28. <br/></p>
<p>Question 427  <br/>Answer: 2  <br/>Option (2) is correct because in the case where there is no listing contract but the agent effects a sale of the <br/>seller&#8217;s property at the request of the seller, the courts can apply the principle of quantum meruit to imply a <br/>promise to pay a reasonable amount for the professional services provided. Option (1) is incorrect for the same <br/>reason. Option (3) is incorrect because the courts will give a reasonable remuneration based on what the service <br/>provided was worth, not just out of pocket expenses. Option (4) is incorrect because, even if there was a listing <br/>contract between the agent and the principal in this case, the agent is working on behalf of the seller and so they <br/>would not be held liable for the buyer&#8217;s default.  </p>


<p>Question 428  <br/>Answer: 1  <br/>First, find the annual depreciation expense from the building. Then, in order to calculate the annual <br/>depreciation expense using the straight-line method, take the cost of the building less any salvage value and <br/>divide the sum by the economic life.  <br/> <br/></p>

<p>XYZ Ltd.&#8217;s taxable income for this year is $511,600.  <br/></p>
<p>Question 429 <br/>Answer: 3 <br/>Option (3) is false and is the correct answer. A client must provide consent when being added to a mailing list <br/>[Option (2)], but even after consent is obtained, the sender must be provided with a way to request to be <br/>removed from the mailing list [Option (1)] and any such requests must be honoured immediately. Option (4) is <br/>incorrect because an email database needs to be maintained regularly and if the client&#8217;s correct email address is <br/>not being used, then they will not receive the messages. <br/></p>
<p>Question 430  <br/>Answer: 4 <br/>Option (4) is correct because rent receivable is considered a current asset. A current asset is something that the <br/>company owns, and will use up within the next year. Option (1) is incorrect because the owner&#8217;s initial <br/>investment will be listed as owner&#8217;s equity. Option (2) is incorrect because rent payable will be listed as a <br/>current liability. Option (3) is incorrect because real property will be recorded as a fixed or long-term asset, and <br/>will be recorded at its historic cost. <br/></p>
<p>Question 431  <br/>Answer: 4 <br/>Option (4) is correct because the agent&#8217;s duty of disclosure includes everything known to the licensee respecting <br/>the transaction and is not limited to situations where there is a detriment to the seller. Failure to make full <br/>disclosure amounts to a breach of the fiduciary duty and where this duty is breached, the seller may not be <br/>required to pay the licensee a commission on closing. Options (1) and (2) are incorrect for the same reason. <br/>Option (3) is incorrect because the agent is acting on behalf of the seller, and thus her fiduciary duty is to Susan, <br/>not to Bella. </p>


<p>Question 432  <br/>Answer: 1 <br/>Option (1) is correct because firewalls are hardware and software boundaries frequently used to prevent <br/>unauthorized users from accessing private computers or networks connected to the internet. All data <br/>attempting to pass through the firewall is blocked unless it meets a certain criteria of authorization needed to <br/>pass through. Options (2), (3), and (4) are therefore incorrect. <br/></p>
<p>Question 433  <br/>Answer: 3 <br/>Option (3) is correct because under the Torrens system in place in British Columbia, all mortgages are <br/>registered as charges against the title and the title will continue to show the borrower (mortgagor) as the <br/>registered owner, not as a charge holder. Option (1), (2), and (4) are incorrect for the same reason. <br/></p>
<p>Question 434  <br/>Answer: 2 <br/>Option (2) is correct because property taxes are an expense included in operating expenses for appraisal <br/>purposes. Options (1), (3), and (4) are incorrect because income taxes, mortgage payments, and capital cost <br/>allowance are not included in operating expenses.  <br/></p>
<p>Question 435 <br/>Answer: 2 <br/>Option (2) is correct because all things being equal, a shorter term on a bonused partially amortized loan will <br/>result in a higher effective interest rate paid by the borrower. This is because the value of the bonus is paid off <br/>over a shorter term, thus increasing the annual cost of borrowing. Options (1), (3), and (4) are incorrect.  <br/></p>
<p>Question 436 <br/>Answer: 4 <br/>Options (1), (2), and (3) are all guidelines that Jason should follow in establishing his real estate blog, therefore <br/>Option (4) is the correct answer. <br/></p>
<p>Question 437 <br/>Answer: 3 <br/>Option (3) is correct because the British Columbia Real Estate Association, its member local real estate boards, <br/>and other professional associations are responsible for enforcing the provisions of the applicable professional <br/>codes of ethics, not the British Columbia Financial Services Authority (BCFSA). Options (1), (2), and (4) are <br/>incorrect because they are all duties for which the BCFSA is responsible. <br/></p>
<p>Question 438 <br/>Answer: 2 <br/>Option (2) is correct because a polyethylene vapour barrier must be used immediately under the interior wood <br/>panelling on the perimeter walls of a western platform wood-frame house in order to ensure proper function of <br/>the vapour barrier. Options (1), (3), and (4) are incorrect because a polyethylene vapour barrier would not be <br/>used under those surfaces.  </p>

<p>Question 440 <br/>Answer: 2 <br/>Option (2) is correct because an estate pur autre vie ends when the person whose life upon which it is based <br/>dies, in this case, Bentley. Option (1) is incorrect because Anton&#8217;s interest is dependent on Bentley&#8217;s life, not his <br/>own. Option (3) is incorrect because Anton&#8217;s interest is not terminated when Charles dies, rather, Charles (or his <br/>heirs, if Charles dies before Bentley) will receive the interest that Anton currently holds once Bentley dies, <br/>ending Anton&#8217;s interest. Option (4) is incorrect because only Bentley must die for Anton&#8217;s interest to end. <br/></p>
<p>Question 441 <br/>Answer: 4 <br/>Option (4) is correct and Options (1), (2), and (3) are incorrect because plastic, galvanized steel, and copper are <br/>common materials used in water supply piping, while aluminum is not.  <br/></p>
<p>Question 442 <br/>Answer: 3 <br/>Option (3) is correct because retained earnings is the company&#8217;s total accumulated profits less any dividends <br/>paid since incorporation. Option (1) is incorrect because it refers to the net income as shown on the income <br/>statement. Option (2) is incorrect because it represents the amount that the retained earnings will increase in a <br/>given year if no dividends are paid. Option (4) is incorrect because it refers to how retained earnings may be <br/>invested, but is not considered retained earnings. </p>

<p>Question 444 <br/>Answer: 4 <br/>Option (4) is correct because the party benefiting from the subject clause (in this case, Patricia) may remove the <br/>clause by declaring it fulfilled by written notice or by waiving it on or before the specified date for the <br/>condition. Option (1) is incorrect because in a standard form contract of purchase and sale, unless each <br/>condition is waived or declared fulfilled, the Contract will be terminated and the deposit would be returned <br/>(i.e., Velma would not retain the deposit). Option (2) is incorrect because the contract will be cancelled if Patricia <br/>does not fulfill the subject clause by selling her home and she does not waive it, so Patricia will not be forced to <br/>complete. Option (3) is incorrect because Patricia must waive the requirement on or before the date specified in <br/>the clause (December 31) rather than any time before completion.  <br/></p>
<p>Question 445 <br/>Answer: 2 <br/>Option (2) is correct because it is true. Option (1) is incorrect because the mortgage qualifying rate is based on <br/>the greater of the government-specified qualifying rate (j2 = 5.25% as of June 2021) or an additional 2% above <br/>the mortgage&#8217;s negotiated contract rate. Option (3) is incorrect because the Office of the Superintendent of <br/>Financial Institutions (OSFI) established the stress test requirements for all new mortgages from federally <br/>chartered institutions. Option (4) is incorrect because the stress test qualification rules only apply to mortgages <br/>from federally regulated financial institutions, which does not include credit unions.  <br/></p>
<p>Question 446 <br/>Answer: 1 <br/>Option (1) is correct because common law duress occurs where a person is forced to enter into a contract <br/>against his or her will by the threat of imprisonment either to himself or his family, or the threat of actual <br/>physical violence. Option (2) is incorrect because difficulty of performance would arise after a contract was <br/>entered into, whereas duress relates to the party being robbed of the free will to enter into the contract. Option <br/>(3) is incorrect because undue influence is a separate concept from duress. Although it also relates to the loss of <br/>free will to contract, it is as a result of a person in a superior or dominant position in relation to another using <br/>their position to induce the other to enter a contract which he or she would not have otherwise made rather <br/>than as a result of a threat. Option (4) is incorrect because it describes negligent misrepresentation rather than <br/>duress.  </p>

<p>Question 448 <br/>Answer: 2 <br/>Option (2) is correct because where taxes have previously been paid by the seller, the buyer will reimburse them <br/>for the portion of the year starting from and including the adjustment date, (i.e., the portion of the year that <br/>they have ownership of the property.) In this case, this includes September 20 to December 31. Options (1), (3), <br/>and (4) are incorrect for this reason. <br/></p>
<p>Question 449 <br/>Answer: 2 <br/>Option (2) is correct because the cost approach of appraisal is generally used for unique properties that do not <br/>have any comparable sales data, relying on a land value estimate from direct comparison, then valuing the <br/>improvements on the land with the cost approach. Since vacant land has no improvements the cost approach <br/>cannot be used on vacant land. Options (1), (3), and (4) could be valued using the cost approach in certain <br/>circumstances. <br/></p>
<p>Question 450  <br/>Answer: 1 <br/>Option (1) is correct because a gain or reward received by an agent from a third party in connection with his or <br/>her agency relationship with the principal, if not disclosed to the principal, is known as a secret profit. Options <br/>(2), (3), and (4) are incorrect for this reason. <br/></p>
<p>Question 451 <br/>Answer: 2 <br/>Option (2) is correct because an agent&#8217;s authority can be granted retroactively through ratification where an <br/>agent enters into a contract on behalf of the principal that is beyond the agent&#8217;s authority, but the principal <br/>later consents to be bound by the unauthorized acts of the agent. Option (1) is incorrect because rectification <br/>occurs when a court corrects an error made by the parties in a contract (or other document) in order to reflect <br/>the parties&#8217; true intentions. Options (3) and (4) are incorrect because rescission and revocation are concepts to <br/>do with offer and acceptance in contract law rather than agency. </p>


<p>Question 452 <br/>Answer: 4 <br/>Option (4) is correct because it is not an essential term of the lease (whether commercial or residential) to <br/>include the occupations of the parties. Options (1), (2), and (3) are incorrect because the names of the parties, a <br/>description of the premises leased, and the rent are all essential terms that should be included in the lease. <br/></p>
<p>Question 453 <br/>Answer: 3 <br/>Option (3) is correct, because in order for a valid contract to be formed, there must be acceptance of an offer. In <br/>this case, although both parties have made identical offers, neither offer has been accepted by the other party. <br/>Joe has not accepted Frank&#8217;s offer because he did not have notice of the offer before sending the email to Frank; <br/>rather, he has make a separate offer. Option (1) is incorrect for the same reason. Option (2) is incorrect because <br/>section 59 of the Law and Equity Act requires most contracts affecting land to be in writing, and since this is not <br/>a contract respecting land, section 59 would not apply. Therefore, Option (4) is also incorrect. <br/></p>
<p>Question 454 <br/>Answer: 1 <br/>Option (1) is correct because satisfying the condition precedent is not a requirement for waiver under the Law <br/>and Equity Act. Options (2), (3), and (4) are incorrect because section 54 of the Law and Equity Act requires that, <br/>in order to waive a condition precedent, the condition precedent must benefit only the party waiving it, the <br/>contract must be capable of being performed without fulfillment of the condition precedent, and the waiver <br/>must be made before the time stipulated for the condition&#8217;s fulfillment (or within a reasonable time if not <br/>specified). <br/></p>
<p>Question 455 <br/>Answer: 1 <br/>Option (1) is correct because revocation refers to the cancellation of an offer communicated by the offeror to the <br/>offeree prior to acceptance. Option (2) is incorrect because rectification occurs when a court corrects an error <br/>made by the parties in the contract (or other document) in order to reflect the parties&#8217; true intentions. Option (3) <br/>is incorrect because rescission refers to the cancellation of a contract. Option (4) is incorrect because Option (1) <br/>is correct. <br/></p>
<p>Question 456 <br/>Answer: 1 <br/>Option (1) is correct because if borrower agrees to a shorter term in order to increase the maximum allowable <br/>loan, they are exposing themselves to greater risk of change in interest rates. The borrower may have to <br/>refinance the loan at a higher interest rate in the future, which may cause financial distress to the borrower. <br/>Option (2) is incorrect because a a borrower, with a higher maximum allowable loan, may still opt to arrange a <br/>new loan with another lender in the future. Option (3) is incorrect because a loan with shorter term and higher <br/>maximum allowable loan would expose the borrower to a greater risk of change in interest rates. Option (4) is <br/>incorrect because the lower interest rate would mean less interest is paid. </p>


<p>Question 457 <br/>Answer: 2 <br/>Option (2) is false. Many, but not all lenders, will set up a separate tax account that the borrower will pay into <br/>every periodic payment. This provides security to the lender that their mortgage is the highest priority charge, <br/>as well as relieves the borrower from having to make a lump sum payment for property taxes. This strategy <br/>requires additional administration by the lender, so typically smaller or private lenders will leave the property <br/>tax payments to the borrower. Option (1) is incorrect because borrowers have the obligation to include payment <br/>of property taxes, insurance, and maintenance. Option (3) is incorrect because there should be a covenant <br/>included in the mortgage loan agreement to insure against fire and other hazards for the property. Option (4) is <br/>incorrect because borrowers should be maintaining the property condition as to not reduce the value of the <br/>property. This is necessary to reduce capital risk. <br/></p>
<p>Question 458 <br/>Answer: 2 <br/>Option (2) is correct because in a joint tenancy, each co-owner owns an undivided interest in the whole of the <br/>estate. Option (1) is incorrect, because, Mary may still sell or mortgage her interest without John&#8217;s consent as a <br/>joint tenant (although doing so will convert the co-ownership to a tenancy in common by severing the unity of <br/>title). Option (3) is incorrect because, although married people or people in close relationships often use joint <br/>tenancies for tax planning purposes, there is no requirement for married couples who are co-owners of a <br/>property to register as joint tenants in, and they are free to co-own as tenants in common if they prefer to do so. <br/></p>
<p>Question 459 <br/>Answer: 4 <br/>Option (4) is correct because quiet enjoyment is an assurance to the tenant against the consequences of a <br/>defective title, i.e., it assures the tenant of the use and enjoyment of the premises for all usual purposes without <br/>physical interference or unreasonable disturbance from the landlord. Option (1) is incorrect because the <br/>implied covenant of quiet enjoyment does not concern noise that interferes specifically with the tenant&#8217;s <br/>business. Option (2) is incorrect because the implied covenant of quiet enjoyment is an implied promise given <br/>by the landlord to the tenant, and does not restrict the tenant&#8217;s own conduct on the property. Option (3) is <br/>incorrect because the implied covenant of quiet enjoyment does not concern the premise&#8217;s fitness for <br/>habitation. <br/></p>
<p>Question 460 <br/>Answer: 4 <br/>Option (4) is the correct answer; an investor will only use borrowed funds if he or she is able to invest the <br/>borrowed funds at a higher rate (not a lower rate) of interest than the borrowing rate. Options (1), (2), and (3) are <br/>all reasons to use borrowed funds in a real estate investment. <br/></p>
<p>Question 461 <br/>Answer: 4 <br/>Option (4) is true and is the correct answer: when a BC statute makes references to &#8220;written&#8221; documents or <br/>signatures, it will not exclude electronic documents and signatures merely because they are in electronic form. <br/>Option (1) is false because a legally binding contract may be formed by an offer or acceptance communicated <br/>through electronic means, but only if the parties so intend. Option (2) is false because certain documents that <br/>relate to land or land transactions, including listing agreements, are covered by the Act. Option (3) is false <br/>because documents that create or transfer interest in land and that require registration to be effective against <br/>third parties are specifically excluded from the Act. </p>


<p>Question 462 <br/>Answer: 4 <br/>The first step to solving this problem is to find the monthly payments and the outstanding balance owing at the <br/>end of the 3-year term. <br/> <br/>Press Display <br/>1.95 &#61568; NOM% 1.95 <br/>2 &#61568; P/YR 2  <br/>&#61568; EFF%  1.959506 <br/>12 &#61568; P/YR  12 <br/>&#61568; NOM%  1.942125 <br/>384000 PV 384,000 <br/>30 &#215; 12 = N 360  <br/>0 FV 0 <br/>PMT &#61473;1,408.25106 <br/>1408.25 +/&#61473; PMT &#61473;1,408.25 <br/>36 INPUT &#61568; AMORT PER 36-36 <br/>= = = 354,859.164285 <br/>354859.16 +/&#61473; FV &#61473;354,859.16 <br/> <br/>The investor is paying $350,000 for the right to receive the monthly payments of $1,408.25 for 3 years and <br/>receives the outstanding balance of $354,859.16 at the end of the 3-year term.

<p>Question 463 <br/>Answer: 4 <br/> Option (4) is correct because a condition precedent is the legal term for a &#8220;subject to&#8221; clause. It calls for the <br/>happening of some event or the performance of some act before the contract is binding upon the parties. Option <br/>(1) is incorrect because a binding contract does not exist when a &#8220;subject to&#8221; clause gives one party sole <br/>discretion over whether or not to proceed with a sale. When a subject clause is wholly subjective, the court may <br/>view the arrangement, in law, as nothing more than an offer. Option (2) is incorrect because it describes a <br/>condition subsequent, not a condition precedent. While a condition subsequent is an event that will discharge <br/>the principal obligations of a party to the contract, a condition precedent is an event that must occur before the <br/>parties are bound to the contract. Option (3) is incorrect because it provides an example of a condition <br/>subsequent.  <br/> </p>
<p>Question 464 <br/>Answer: 4 <br/>Option (4) is correct because a mortgage of the equity of redemption, an agreement to execute a legal mortgage, <br/>and a mortgage by way of deposit of the duplicate certificate of title are all examples of ways to create equitable <br/>mortgages. A mortgage of the equity of redemption is a mortgage of the equitable interest in the land that the <br/>borrower retains after granting a legal mortgage. An agreement to grant a mortgage in the future is recognized <br/>as a present equitable mortgage. A mortgage by way of deposit of the duplicate certificate of title occurs when a <br/>bank requires the duplicate certificate as collateral security for a demand loan. </p>


<p>Question 465 <br/>Answer: 3 <br/>Option (3) is correct because a purchaser has a right to rescind the purchase agreement if the developer fails to <br/>deliver a disclosure statement to the purchaser by serving a written notice of rescission on the developer under <br/>the Real Estate Development Marketing Act (REDMA). Option (1) is incorrect because REDMA applies to the <br/>marketing of development units in a development property, and subdivisions are included as development <br/>properties. Option (2) is incorrect because the a subdivided lot in a development property is called a <br/>development unit. <br/></p>
<p>Question 466 <br/>Answer: 2 <br/>Option (2) is the best evidence of market value because of the similarity and recent nature of the sale of the <br/>homes. Option (1) is incorrect because the subject property has unique characteristics that was sold to a special <br/>purchaser. Option (3) is incorrect because the urgency of Miss Jones&#8217; sale will likely have an unpredictable <br/>influence on the sale price. Option (4) is incorrect because this is an example of a sale between related parties (a <br/>special relationship) where the sale price may be discounted to less than market value. <br/></p>
<p>Question 467 <br/>Answer: 3 <br/> Cost of Improvements   $2,500,000 = $50 &#215; 50,000 <br/>+ Site Value  +   750,000 <br/>&#61473; Depreciation       &#61473; 250,000 = 0.10 &#215; $2,500,000 <br/> Market Value     $3,000,000 <br/> </p>
<p>Question 468 <br/>Answer: 1 <br/>Option (1) is correct because under section 3(3) of the Occupiers Liability Act, an occupier has no duty of care to <br/>a person in respect of risks willingly assumed by that person (other than a duty not to create a danger with <br/>intent to do harm to the person or damage or the person&#8217;s property, or to act with reckless disregard to the <br/>safety of the person or the integrity of the person&#8217;s property). Options (2), (3), and (4) are incorrect because <br/>under section 3(2) of the Occupiers Liability Act, the duty of care owed by an occupier applies in relation to the <br/>condition of the premises, the activities on the premises, or the conduct of third parties on the premises. <br/></p>
<p>Question 469 <br/>Answer: 4 <br/>Option (4) is correct because the residual method is most appropriate for properties with latent value or <br/>(re)development potential. Options (1), (2), and (3) are incorrect. </p>


<p>Question 470 <br/>Answer: 4 <br/>Find the payments, rounded up to the nearest dollar, based on the terms of the mortgage contract that are given <br/>in the question. <br/> <br/>Press Display <br/>7 &#61568; NOM% 7 <br/>2 &#61568; P/YR 2 <br/>&#61568; EFF% 7.1225 <br/>12 &#61568; P/YR 12 <br/>&#61568; NOM%  6.900047  <br/>170000 PV 170,000 <br/>0 FV 0 <br/>240 N 240 <br/>PMT  &#61473;1,307.828081 <br/> <br/>The monthly payment, rounded up to the next higher dollar, is $1,308. <br/></p>
<p>Question 471 <br/>Answer: 4 <br/>From the information given, calculate the loan-to-value ratio. This will be the maximum loan divided by the <br/>lending value. <br/> <br/>$122,500 &#247; $153,125 = 0.8  <br/>Option (4) is true; therefore, Option (3) must be false. The lending value of the property is what the appraiser <br/>estimates the property value to be. In this case, the lending value is $153,125. Therefore, Options (1) and (2) are <br/>false.  <br/></p>
<p>Question 472 <br/>Answer: 3 <br/>Option (3) is correct because a damage award would put Sally in the position she would have been in if the <br/>contract had been performed as promised, so she would be able to recover the money she lost from the value of <br/>the sewing machines dropping as a result of the wholesaler&#8217;s breach. Option (1) is incorrect because quantum <br/>meruit would only be awarded when the price was not fixed in the contract (and so the court implies a promise <br/>to pay a reasonable sum). In this case, the price was stipulated in the contract. Options (2) and (4) are incorrect <br/>because the court will refuse to grant equitable remedies (such as specific performance and injunction) when <br/>damages are an adequate remedy, as they are in this case.  </p>

<p>Question 474 <br/>Answer: 1 <br/>Max loan = Lending value &#215; Loan-to-value <br/>Max loan = $66,000 &#215; 0.80  <br/>Max loan = $52,800  <br/><br/>This is the amount of their mortgage. <br/> <br/>The question asks for the down payment. If the purchase price is $67,000, and the mortgage is $52,800, then the <br/>down payment is equal to the difference of $14,200 ($67,000 &#61473; $52,800). <br/></p>
<p>Question 475 <br/>Answer: 3 <br/>Option (3) is correct because a contract is formed where there is offer, acceptance, and consideration. In the case <br/>of a contract to purchase land, the consideration is the promise to convey title to the purchaser in exchange for <br/>the purchase price &#8211; the deposit is not required as consideration in order for a valid contract to be formed. <br/>Option (1) is incorrect for the same reason. Option (2) is incorrect because there is no requirement for the <br/>licensee to pay his or her own money into the brokerage&#8217;s trust account where a buyer makes an offer to <br/>purchase land without a deposit. Option (4) is incorrect because the offer is treated as an offer so long as it is <br/>capable of being unequivocally accepted, regardless of whether or not a deposit is paid.  <br/></p>
<p>Question 476 <br/>Answer: 4 <br/>Option (4) is correct because, under the Real Estate Services Act, a licensed representative is not entitled to carry <br/>out trading services for an unlicensed brokerage, to be the managing broker of their own proprietorship, or to <br/>carry out trading services without being employed by a brokerage.  <br/></p>
<p>Question 477 <br/>Answer: 1 <br/>Option (1) is correct because duplicate certificates of title cannot be issued if title is subject to a mortgage or an <br/>agreement for sale. Option (2) is incorrect because while transfers, mortgages, and long-term leases cannot be <br/>registered if a duplicate title is out of the land title office, some specific documents, including easements and <br/>builders liens, can still be registered. Option (3) is incorrect because a duplicate title will only be issued upon a <br/>written request of the registered owner. Option (4) is incorrect because most lenders prefer a registered <br/>mortgage as security. <br/>  </p>


<p>Question 478 <br/>Answer: 4 <br/>Option (4) is correct because the Business Practices and Consumer Protection Act allows the court to intervene <br/>and effectively rewrite the transaction where it considers the cost of the loan to be excessive or the transaction is <br/>harsh and unconscionable. Options (1), (2), and (3) are incorrect because the Interest Act, the Mortgage Brokers <br/>Act, and the Real Estate Services Act do not confer this power on the courts.  <br/></p>
<p>Question 479 <br/>Answer: 2 <br/>Option (2) is correct because in the case that taxes are to be paid in the future by the buyer, the seller&#8217;s share <br/>from January 1 to the adjustment date will be a debit on the seller&#8217;s statement of adjustments and will reduce <br/>the cash proceeds due to him. Option (1) is incorrect because Paula should be given a credit for the estimated <br/>taxes between January 1 and April 30 (i.e., the time that Vince owned the property), not from May 1 to <br/>December 31. Option (3) is incorrect because of the amount of taxes is not yet known, it will be calculated based <br/>on estimates. Option (4) is incorrect because the taxes will appear as a credit on Paula&#8217;s statement and a debit on <br/>Vince&#8217;s statement. <br/></p>
<p>Question 480 <br/>Answer: 2 <br/>Option (2) is the correct answer as vacant land can only be appraised using the comparative approach. <br/>Therefore, Options (1), (3), and (4) are incorrect. <br/></p>

<p>Question 482 <br/>Answer: 1 <br/>First, calculate the monthly payment and the outstanding balance owing at the end of the 5-year term based on <br/>the contract rate. Then, calculate the market value of the mortgage based on the contract payment and <br/>outstanding balance using the market rate of interest. Since the market interest rate is higher than the contract <br/>rate, the market value of the mortgage will be less than the mortgage amount of $150,000. <br/> <br/>Press Display <br/>5 &#61568; NOM% 5 <br/>2 &#61568; P/YR 2 <br/>&#61568; EFF% 5.0625 <br/>12 &#61568; P/YR 12 <br/>&#61568; NOM% 4.948699 <br/>150000 PV 150,000 <br/>300 N 300 <br/>0 FV 0 <br/>PMT  &#61473;872.407478 <br/>873 +/&#61473; PMT &#61473;873 <br/>60 INPUT &#61568; AMORT PER 60-60 <br/>= = =  132,721.018365 <br/>132721.02 +/&#61473; FV &#61473;132,721.02 <br/>8 &#61568; NOM% 8 <br/>2 &#61568; P/YR 2 <br/>&#61568; EFF% 8.16 <br/>12 &#61568; P/YR 12 <br/>&#61568; NOM%  7.869836 <br/>60 N  60 <br/>PV 132,849.118994 (market value of the mortgage) <br/> <br/>The market value of the mortgage is $132,849.12. <br/></p>
<p>Question 483 <br/>Answer: 2 <br/>Option (2) is correct because licensees owe a duty to act with reasonable care and skill to all parties, including <br/>both clients and non-clients. Option (1) is incorrect because a licensee must act in the best interests of their <br/>client in a transaction. They do not have a duty to act in the best interests of non-clients. Option (3) is incorrect <br/>because a licensee does not owe a duty of loyalty to non-clients; they only owe an ethical duty of loyalty to their <br/>clients. Option (4) is incorrect because a licensee who breaches their ethical duty to a client is no longer acting <br/>ethically. <br/></p>
<p>Question 484 <br/>Answer: 3 <br/>Option (3) is true because the apartment is in an area that is zoned for commercial use and surrounding <br/>developments are all office buildings. Given this, the apartment possesses latent value. Therefore, Option (1) is <br/>incorrect as the property is &#8220;ripe for re-development&#8221;. Option (2) is incorrect because the tenants&#8217; rent cannot <br/>increase until the lease renewal in two years. Option (4) is incorrect because the apartment is not at its highest <br/>and best use if it possesses latent value.  </p>


<p>Question 485 <br/>Answer: 3 <br/>Option (3) is correct because, since the cooperative owner is a tenant of the cooperative corporation and they do <br/>not own an estate in land, financing of a cooperative purchase may be more difficult as a buyer can only grant <br/>the lender a security interest in his or her shares under the Personal Property Security Act and, if not prohibited <br/>by the corporation, a mortgage of his or her leasehold interest. Banks and lending institutions are less willing to <br/>lend on this form of security. Option (1) is incorrect because, while a fee simple strata property is created by a <br/>strata plan which is filed in the land title office, a cooperative is created by the incorporation of a company or a <br/>cooperative association. Option (2) is incorrect because cooperative ownership does not bestow an individual <br/>fee simple title to the cooperative owner&#8217;s unit; rather, the owner in a cooperative possesses shares in a <br/>non-profit corporation which in turn holds title to the land. Option (4) is incorrect because strata lot owners are <br/>generally not restricted in any way as to whom he/she wishes to sell the strata lot to, whereas a cooperative <br/>owner typically must have the buyer approved by the cooperative association&#8217;s board of directors. <br/></p>
<p>Question 486  <br/>Answer: 4 <br/>Option (4) is correct because a listing licensee is required to provide a Disclosure of Expected Remuneration <br/>(Payment) form to a seller whenever he or she presents an offer to acquire real estate to a seller. Options (1), (2), <br/>and (3) are incorrect for this reason. <br/></p>

<p>Question 488 <br/>Answer: 2 <br/>Option (2) is correct; depreciation expense is an attempt to allocate the cost of the asset over its useful life. <br/>Option (1) is incorrect; depreciation expense is not another name for capital cost allowance (CCA) because CCA <br/>is a method of calculating depreciation for income tax purposes. Option (3) is incorrect; land is not considered <br/>to be a depreciable asset thus depreciation expense is never taken on land. Option (4) is incorrect because a <br/>company holding a single-family residence as an asset is entitled to claim depreciation expense on their income <br/>statement.  <br/></p>
<p>Question 489 <br/>Answer: 3 <br/>Option (3) is correct because agency law is concerned with matters between two (or more) individuals, and so it <br/>would fall within the body of private law rather than public law. Options (1), (2), and (4) are incorrect because <br/>they deal with matters that have to do with the relationship between individuals and the state or matters that <br/>are of direct concern to the state, so they fall within the body of public law. </p>


<p>Question 490 <br/>Answer: 3 <br/>Option (3) is correct because when using the income approach, an appropriate annual allowance or reserve <br/>should be made to cover the total cost of periodic repairs. For example, to cover the cost of painting every three <br/>years, one-third of the total painting cost could be allocated as an expense each year. Options (1), (2), and (4) are <br/>therefore incorrect. <br/></p>
<p>Question 491 <br/>Answer: 2 <br/>Option (2) is correct because income earned by a family trust will be taxed separately for each beneficiary, at <br/>each of their own personal tax rates. Options (1), (3), and (4) are incorrect because they are all true statements. <br/></p>
<p>Question 492 <br/>Answer: 4 <br/>Option (4) is correct because it is true. Option (1) is incorrect because newsletters should not be sent more <br/>frequently than once a week. Option (2) is incorrect because a newsletter should provide compelling content, <br/>such as market news, local events, real estate-related tips, and information on new housing developments. <br/>Option (3) is incorrect because even though pictures can enhance the look of the newsletter, one must <br/>remember to keep the file size of the newsletter small so the message is easily received. <br/></p>
<p>Question 493 <br/>Answer: 4 <br/>Option (4) is correct because when a licensee takes a deposit from a buyer, section 28 of the Real Estate Services <br/>Act says that the brokerage must hold the deposit as a stakeholder (and not as an agent) on behalf of all the <br/>parties to the contract. Therefore, Options (1), (2), and (3) are incorrect. </p>

<p>Question 496 <br/>Answer: 3 <br/>Option (3) is correct because there is no requirement for an offer to be in writing in order to be accepted; rather, <br/>it can be expressed in any form, including in writing, orally, or by conduct. Options (1), (2), and (4) are incorrect <br/>because an offer must be made in clear and unambiguous terms such that both parties clearly understand the <br/>extent of their obligations, and the offer must demonstrate a serious intention to be bound in order to be <br/>capable of forming a contract on acceptance.  <br/></p>
<p>Question 497 <br/>Answer: 3 <br/>Option (3) is correct because the Occupiers Liability Act (OLA) has removed the common law distinction <br/>between different types of visitors. Option (1) is incorrect because section 1 of the OLA specifies that there may <br/>be more than one occupier of the same premises. Option (2) is incorrect because section 3 of the OLA states that <br/>an occupier has no duty of care in respect of risks willingly assumed by a visitor, other than a duty not to create <br/>a danger with intent to do harm to the person or damage to the person&#8217;s property, or to act with reckless <br/>disregard to the safety of the person or the integrity of the person&#8217;s property. Option (4) is incorrect because the <br/>legislation specifies that the duty of care imposed on an occupier is to take such care as is reasonable in the <br/>circumstances, so it is likely that the standard owed in the circumstances of someone trespassing on the <br/>property would be lower than that owed to an invited guest. </p>


<p>Question 498 <br/>Answer: 4 <br/>Option (4) is correct because the square foot adjustment for the property is +$15,000. We know that each <br/>additional 100 square feet is worth $5,000, so $15,000 &#247; $5,000 = 300 sq ft bigger than the comparable property. <br/>Therefore, the total square footage of the subject property is 2,300 + 300 = 2,600. Since the comparable has 4 <br/>bedrooms and was adjusted +$4,200, the comparable has one more bedroom than the subject (5 bedrooms in <br/>subject). Options (1), (2), and (3) are therefore incorrect. <br/></p>
<p>Question 499 <br/>Answer: 3 <br/>Option (3) is correct because the development and operation of airports is an exclusively federal matter. <br/>Options (1), (2), and (4) are incorrect because each of these issues could be regulated by zoning bylaws <br/>implemented by a local government.  <br/></p>
<p>Question 500 <br/>Answer: 1 <br/>Option (1) is correct because the Interest Act imposes no limit on the rate of interest which can be charged in a <br/>mortgage transaction (however, a rate of interest can be challenged under other legislation, such as the <br/>Criminal Code). Option (2) is incorrect because section 6 of the Interest Act requires that, where a mortgage <br/>requires blended payments, the mortgage document must contain a statement of the interest rate calculated <br/>either &#8220;yearly or half-yearly not in advance.&#8221; Option (3) is incorrect because under section 3 of the Interest Act, if <br/>a document requires interest to be paid but the rate is not set out, then the rate allocated by law is 5% per <br/>annum. Option (4) is incorrect because section 8 of the Interest Act states that the interest rate on arrears cannot <br/>be greater than the regular rate payable on the principal. <br/></p>
<p>Question 501 <br/>Answer: 4 <br/>Option (4) is correct because a &#8220;time clause&#8221; or &#8220;72 hour clause&#8221; is a clause contained in a contract for purchase <br/>or resale of land which allows a seller to invoke a time period in which a condition precedent must be removed. <br/>If invoked, failure to remove the condition precedent within the time period would result in termination of the <br/>contract. Option (1) is incorrect because a time clause does not, in and of itself, mean that the offer is only open <br/>for a stipulated time period. Rather, the right to invoke a time clause arises only where a seller receives a <br/>subsequent offer after entering the original contract of purchase and sale. Option (2) is incorrect because this is <br/>a right given to the seller only. Option (3) is incorrect because time clauses relate to conditions precedent, not <br/>conditions subsequent. <br/></p>
<p>Question 502 <br/>Answer: 2 <br/>Option (2) is correct because trespass is actionable per se, meaning that no actual damage needs to be proven in <br/>order for an occupier to sue in trespass. Option (1) is incorrect for the same reason. Option (3) is incorrect <br/>because trespass is actionable. Option (4) is incorrect because there is no 30 day limit for bringing an action in <br/>trespass. <br/></p>
<p>Question 503 <br/>Answer: 2 <br/>Option (2) is correct because a vacant site can only be valued using the comparative approach of appraisal. <br/>Options (1), (3), and (4) are therefore incorrect. </p>

<p>Question 505 <br/>Answer: 4 <br/>Option (4) is correct because &#8220;real estate services&#8221; is defined in the Real Estate Services Act to include: (a) rental <br/>property management services; (b) strata management services; and (c) trading services. Finding a party to <br/>acquire real estate and advising on the appropriate price for real estate are both &#8220;trading services&#8221; under the <br/>Real Estate Services Act. Collecting rents or security deposits for the use of real estate is a &#8220;rental property <br/>management service&#8221; according to the Real Estate Services Act. <br/></p>

<p>Question 507 <br/>Answer: 4 <br/><b>Buyer&#8217;s Statement of Adjustments (Mr. Jones)</b> <br/><b>ITEM      DEBIT   CREDIT <br/></b>Purchase Price  200,000.00  <br/>Deposit   15,000.00 <br/>Conveyancing Fees     350.00  <br/>Buyer's Share of Taxes     800.00  <br/>Property Transfer Tax   2,000.00  <br/>Balance Due to Complete* _________ <b>188,150.00</b> <br/> <br/> 203,150.00 203,150.00 <br/>*Because the total Debits and Credits must balance, in order to find the Balance Due to Complete, you must first calculate the total  <br/> Debits ($203,150.00) and then subtract the known Credits. The result is the balance due from the buyer to complete the transaction. <br/></p>
<p>Question 508 <br/>Answer: 2 <br/>Option (2) is correct because rents receivable is the only account listed that will be classified as a current asset. A <br/>current asset is something that the company owns, that will be used up within the next year. The rent receivable <br/>account is expected to be collected within the next year. Options (1) and (3) are incorrect because land and real <br/>property are classified as fixed- or long-term assets. Option (4) is incorrect because accounts payable is <br/>classified as a current liability. <br/></p>
<p>Question 509 <br/>Answer: 2 <br/>Option (2) is correct because the standard of care expected of a licensee is based on what a reasonable licensee <br/>ought to have done in all the circumstances. In this situation, a reasonable buyer&#8217;s agent would have made <br/>inquiries as to the landslide risk relating to the property given that the area was publicly known for landslide <br/>risks. Option (1) is incorrect because it is reasonably foreseeable that the actions or inactions of licensees will <br/>affect their clients. Option (3) is incorrect because negligence law may also provide compensation for <br/>non-physical damages such as economic losses. Option (4) is incorrect because Options (1) and (3) are incorrect.  <br/></p>
<p>Question 510 <br/>Answer: 2 <br/>Option (2) is correct because there is a fundamental principle of mortgage law which prohibits &#8220;clogging&#8221; on <br/>&#8220;the equity of redemption&#8221;. The equity of redemption refers to a borrower&#8217;s right to repay the mortgage and, <br/>upon doing so, to redeem his or her legal title to the property free of all encumbrances. In other words, a <br/>borrower (or the mortgagor) cannot be prevented by the terms of the mortgage from eventually redeeming his <br/>or her property free from the conditions contained in the mortgage. An option to purchase a mortgaged <br/>property given by the mortgagor (the borrower) to the mortgagee (the lender) at the time the mortgage is <br/>negotiated, if exercised, would prevent the mortgagor from redeeming his or her property upon repayment, <br/>and is therefore void. Option (1) is incorrect because the prohibition against clogging does not disappear even <br/>where the mortgagor has independent legal advice. Option (3) is incorrect because a void option cannot be <br/>enforceable in any case. Option (4) is incorrect because the equity of redemption refers to a mortgagor&#8217;s right to <br/>repay the mortgage, and is not a term for an option to repurchase a mortgaged property.  </p>


<p>Question 511 <br/>Answer: 2 <br/>Option (2) is correct because if the term of a constant level payment mortgage is shortened, the result will be a <br/>higher outstanding balance at the end of the term. This occurs because a shorter term has fewer payments that <br/>will pay down principal and reduce the outstanding balance with each payment. Option (1) is incorrect because <br/>the size of periodic payments is not increased when the contractual term in shortened in a constant level <br/>payment mortgage. Option (3) is incorrect because the interest rate is not affected. Option (4) is incorrect <br/>because the payment frequency will not change.  <br/></p>
<p>Question 512 <br/>Answer: 4 <br/>Option (4) is correct because any person may, under the Assessment Act, make a complaint against an entry in <br/>an assessment roll on the grounds that the property has been valued at too high or too low an amount. Any <br/>initial appeal against a real property assessment must be submitted to the Property Assessment Review Panel <br/>for initial adjudication. Option (1) is incorrect because there are no &#8220;municipal courts&#8221; to deal with property <br/>assessment complaints. Option (2) is incorrect because the Court of Appeal will not hear formal complaints <br/>regarding assessment notices. The Court of Appeal will only review issues of law arising from lower court <br/>decisions. Option (3) is incorrect because, while the Property Assessment Appeal Board may order the <br/>Assessment Commissioner to carry out a reassessment, formal complaints are not made to the Commissioner. <br/></p>
<p>Question 513 <br/>Answer: 3 <br/>Option (3) is correct because under the Residential Tenancy Act, when a fixed term residential tenancy expires <br/>and the agreement does not provide that the tenant will vacate the rental unit when the term expires, the <br/>landlord and the tenant are presumed to have renewed the original agreement as a month-to-month tenancy. <br/>Section 49 of the Residential Tenancy Act allows a landlord to terminate a tenancy agreement where the <br/>landlord enters into a good faith agreement to sell the rental unit and the purchaser intends to occupy that unit, <br/>provided that each of the conditions laid out in Option (3) are met. If the purchaser does not occupy the unit as <br/>intended for at least six months, the purchaser must pay the tenant an amount equivalent to 12 months&#8217; rent. <br/> Option (1) is incorrect because a landlord cannot terminate a tenancy agreement to allow his or her sibling to <br/>occupy the rental unit without further justification. There is a provision for a &#8220;close family member&#8221; but <br/>siblings do not fall under that category. <br/> Option (2) is incorrect because, as previously mentioned, Lucy and Linus are presumed to have renewed the <br/>original agreement as a month-to-month tenancy. In order to end the tenancy, Lucy must be able to rely on a <br/>provision in the Residential Tenancy Act which allows her to do so. Unfortunately, in Lucy&#8217;s situation, Charlie <br/>is her brother and not a &#8220;close family member&#8221;. Even if Charlie was a &#8220;close family member&#8221;, Lucy would need <br/>to provide two months&#8217; notice. <br/> Option (4) is incorrect because Lucy would need to provide at least two months&#8217; notice to end the tenancy. </p>


<p>Question 514 <br/>Answer: 2 <br/>Option (2) is correct because an appeal against a real property assessment must be submitted to the Property <br/>Assessment Panel for initial adjudication. Subsequently, an appeal may be made to the Property Assessment <br/>Appeal Board. An appeal can then be made from the Property Assessment Appeal Board to the Supreme Court <br/>of British Columbia, only if it is based on a point of law. Option (1) is incorrect because an appeal must first be <br/>submitted to the Property Assessment Panel. Option (3) is incorrect because an appeal may reach the Supreme <br/>Court of British Columbia. Option (4) is incorrect because an appeal following a decision of the Property <br/>Assessment Review Panel must first be submitted to the Property Assessment Appeal Board. <br/></p>
<p>Question 515 <br/>Answer: 3 <br/>Option (3) is correct because the &#8220;postal acceptance rule&#8221; provides that where an offer is made by mail, or other <br/>non-instantaneous means, acceptance is effective when it is posted. Option (1) is incorrect because the offeree is <br/>the party accepting the offer. Option (2) is incorrect because, if an offer is made by mail, acceptance need not be <br/>received by the offeror to be effective. Option (4) is incorrect because, in some cases, a document may not be <br/>postmarked the very day it is posted. <br/></p>
<p>Question 516 <br/>Answer: 2 <br/>Option (2) is correct because, in British Columbia, the Business Practices and Consumer Protection Act gives <br/>courts the power to grant relief where a mortgage transaction is deemed inequitable, or where the cost of a loan <br/>is excessive and the transaction is harsh and unconscionable. Option (1) in incorrect because the federal <br/>Interest Act does not impose a limit on the rate of interest which can be charged in a mortgage transaction. <br/>Option (3) is incorrect because the Land Title Act does not provide for relief for excessive mortgage interest <br/>rates. Option (4) is incorrect because Options (1) and (3) are incorrect.  <br/></p>
<p>Question 517 <br/>Answer: 3 <br/>Option (3) is correct because the APR is the borrower&#8217;s contractual interest rate plus any non-interest financing <br/>charges such as and bonuses or fees. Option (1) is incorrect because the APR is not a requirement under the <br/>Federal Interest Act. Option (2) is incorrect because the APR includes non-interest financing charges, and thus <br/>may differ from the stated interest rate. Option (4) is incorrect because the APR is not expressed with <br/>semi-annual compounding. <br/></p>
<p>Question 518 <br/>Answer: 3 <br/>Option (3) is correct because these criteria characterize successful negotiations which are most likely to render <br/>optimal outcomes for both parties. Options (1) and (4) are incorrect because negotiation need not be a zero-sum <br/>game where the only solution is a compromise down the middle. Option (2) is incorrect because a &#8220;distributive <br/>perspective&#8221;, viewing negotiation as a conflict with one winner and one loser, can inhibit creative problem <br/>solving and makes it difficult to reach optimal results.  <br/></p>
<p>Question 519 <br/>Answer: 1 <br/>Option (1) is correct. Since the market rate is higher than the contract rate, the market value of the mortgage is <br/>less than the face value of $45,000. The cash-equivalent value of the mortgage at 8% will be less than a $45,000 <br/>mortgage at 13%. Options (2), (3), and (4) are therefore incorrect. </p>


<p>Question 520 <br/>Answer: 3  <br/>Option (3) is correct because the sloped floors were a defect that could have been discovered during the course <br/>of a reasonable inspection. Therefore, the sloped floors were a patent defect. The general rule regarding patent <br/>defects is that the buyer assumes the risk (caveat emptor), meaning that the seller and the listing licensee are <br/>not required to disclose discoverable defects. Option (1) is incorrect because, while it can be prudent to do so, <br/>neither the seller nor the seller&#8217;s agent has a duty to inspect the premises prior to advertising it for sale. Option <br/>(2) is incorrect because a vendor is not required to disclose patent defects. Option (4) is incorrect because <br/>Options (1) and (2) are both incorrect. <br/></p>
<p>Question 521 <br/>Answer: 2 <br/>Option (2) is correct because the mobile office environment permits representatives to work from home, out in <br/>the field, or from other locations that the traditional offices. An advantage of this is that it eliminates certain <br/>inefficiencies, such as time spent commuting to and from the office, which allows representatives more time to <br/>focus on more productive, income-generating tasks. Option (1) is incorrect because due to decentralization, it is <br/>more difficult, not easier, to establish a sense of community within the brokerage in a mobile office <br/>environment. Option (3) is incorrect because representatives may feel disconnected from the brokerage when <br/>they are less physically present, resulting in a weaker sense of loyalty. Since Options (1) and (3) are incorrect, <br/>Option (4) is also incorrect. <br/></p>
<p>Question 522 <br/>Answer: 4 <br/>Option (4) is correct because the principle of good faith includes the duty of honest performance, where parties <br/>to a contract are under a duty to act honestly in the performance of their contractual obligations. Options (1), <br/>(2), and (3) are incorrect because these are not duties included in the general organizing principle of good faith.  <br/></p>
<p>Question 523 <br/>Answer: 2 <br/>Option (2) is correct because, as far as commercial tenancies are concerned, there are no legal restrictions <br/>regarding security deposits. Options (1), (3), and (4) are incorrect for the same reason. <br/></p>
<p>Question 524 <br/>Answer: 3 <br/>Option (3) is correct because the definitions of &#8220;trading services&#8221; and a &#8220;trade in real estate&#8221; in the Real Estate <br/>Services Act permit trading services licensees to negotiate lease terms. The remaining options are incorrect <br/>because they describe activities that do not fall within the definition of trading services. <br/></p>
<p>Question 525  <br/>Answer: 3 <br/>Option (3) is correct because when a licensee is faced with a conflict of interest between multiple clients, the <br/>licensee must enter into an Agreement Regarding Conflict of Interest Between Clients with all clients. Options <br/>(1), (2), and (4) are incorrect for this reason. <br/></p>
<p>Question 526 <br/>Answer: 2 <br/>Option (2) is correct because the School Act is one of seven statutes which form the foundation of the real <br/>property tax system in British Columbia. The School Act provides for real property taxation to fund public </p>


<p>school education throughout the province. Options (1), (3), and (4) are not included among the 17 statutes <br/>which significantly affect the real property taxation system in British Columbia. <br/></p>
<p>Question 527 <br/>Answer: 4 <br/>Option (4) is correct because private nuisance typically occurs where an owner or occupier of land <br/>unreasonably and substantially interferes with the reasonable use and enjoyment of a neighbouring property. <br/>Option (1) is incorrect because section 26(3) of the Residential Tenancy Act abolishes the remedy of distress in <br/>residential tenancies. Option (2) is incorrect because &#8220;distraint&#8221; or &#8220;distress&#8221; means a seizure and sale of the <br/>tenant&#8217;s personal property to recover arrears of rent. Option (3) is incorrect because a commercial landlord can <br/>exercise the remedy of distress, which is often the most effective remedy available to the landlord. <br/></p>
<p>Question 528 <br/>Answer: 4 <br/>Option (4) is correct because, in British Columbia, the plaintiff calls each of its witnesses first. Once the <br/>defendant&#8217;s lawyer has had the opportunity to cross-examine each witness called by the plaintiff, the defendant <br/>then calls each of its own witnesses. Options (1), (2), and (3) are incorrect because each statement accurately <br/>describes the trial process in British Columbia. <br/></p>
<p>Question 529 <br/>Answer: 4 <br/>Option (4) is correct as a strata council is the only party listed that is not likely to require an appraisal. Options <br/>(1), (2), and (3) are incorrect because each of these parties are likely to require an appraisal.   <br/></p>
<p>Question 530 <br/>Answer: 4 <br/>The correct answer is Option (4) since the income approach is more likely a primary method of appraisal for a <br/>commercial property valuation with income and expense data, rather than a single-family residence. Options <br/>(1) and (2) are incorrect because they describe warranted valuation practices. Option (3) is considered <br/>warranted, because although the two houses have similar floor plans and are in the same neighborhood, a sale <br/>without sufficient advertising may signal a non-arm&#8217;s length sale and would not be considered reliable. <br/></p>
<p>Question 531 <br/>Answer: 2 <br/>Land does not depreciate; therefore Option (2) is correct. Options (1), (3), and (4) are depreciable assets. <br/></p>
<p>Question 532 <br/>Answer: 2 <br/>Option (2) is correct because the value in exchange is the sale price of the home. Options (1), (3), and (4) are <br/>therefore incorrect. </p>


<p>Question 533 <br/>Answer: 3 <br/>Option (3) is correct because a leasehold interest is of a fixed duration, whereas a fee simple estate confers the <br/>right to possess and use land for an indefinite period of time. Option (1) is incorrect because, while the fee <br/>simple estate is the greatest estate in land in Canadian law, the Crown retains underlying title to all land. <br/>Therefore, fee simple estates remain subject to the Crown&#8217;s land use regulations. Option (2) is incorrect because, <br/>though rarely exercised, the Crown retains the prerogative power to expropriate land held in fee simple. Option <br/>(4) is incorrect because land held in fee simple will escheat (or, revert) back to the Crown if the owner of the <br/>estate dies without providing for the transfer of his or her property by way of will and has no known heirs. <br/></p>
<p>Question 534 <br/>Answer: 3 <br/>Option (3) is correct (false) because if Yang files an objection and an appeals officer at the CRA confirms the <br/>assessment, Yang would have 90 days to appeal to the Tax Court of Canada. She could also potentially appeal <br/>the decision to the Federal Court of Appeal and then possibly to the Supreme Court of Canada. Options (1), (2), <br/>and (4) are incorrect because they are all true statements.  <br/></p>
<p>Question 535 <br/>Answer: 2 <br/>Option (2) is correct because unless the buyer instructs otherwise, an offer to purchase real estate must have <br/>standard terms relating to contract assignment. Option (1) is incorrect because the Knowledge Base, <br/>&#8220;Assignment Guidelines&#8221;, states that these words should not be used to describe the buyer. Option (3) is <br/>incorrect because assignments are permissible only as long as the Standard Assignment Terms are included in <br/>the contract of purchase and sale of real estate, and provided that the assignment does not prejudice the rights <br/>of the seller and the contract does not prohibit assignment. Option (4) is incorrect because a contract of <br/>purchase and sale can be assigned if certain requirements are met. <br/></p>
<p>Question 536 <br/>Answer: 1 <br/>Option (1) is correct because it is an action taken during the placement stage, meant to avoid drawing the <br/>attention of financial institutions which would take note of unusually large cash deposits. Options (2) and (4) <br/>are incorrect because they are actions taken during the layering stage of the money-laundering process, meant <br/>to increase complexity and conceal the criminal origins of the proceeds. Option (3) is incorrect because it is an <br/>action taken during the integration stage. The sale of real estate will provide proceeds which appear to have <br/>been legally earned from investment. <br/></p>
<p>Question 537 <br/>Answer: 2 <br/>The formula for this question is the costs of improvements plus the site value minus depreciation. <br/> <br/>  Cost of Improvements  $2,294,000 ($62 &#61512; 37,000) <br/>+  Site Value   +  1,200,000  <br/>  $3,494,000  <br/>&#61473;    Depreciation  &#61473;   183,520 (0.08 &#61512; $2,294,000) <br/>         Market Value  $3,310,480 </p>


<p>Question 538 <br/>Answer: 4 <br/>Option (4) is correct because personal selling involves interactive, face-to-face communication with a potential <br/>customer. Option (1) is incorrect because telemarketing uses telephone or fax technology in place of face-to-face <br/>communication. Option (2) is incorrect because emotional appeal refers to a communications strategy that aims <br/>to stir up positive or negative emotions in an audience in order to generate a desired response. Option (3) is <br/>incorrect because brand marketing refers to a marketing initiative based on the theme of a business, which <br/>encompasses a variety of attributes that distinguish the business from its competitors.  <br/></p>
<p>Question 539 <br/>Answer: 2 <br/>Option (2) is correct because a private nuisance occurs when an owner or occupier of land unreasonably and <br/>substantially interferes with the reasonable use and enjoyment of a neighbouring property. Private nuisance <br/>typically occurs when an owner or occupier wrongfully allows the escape of injurious things (in this case, <br/>chlorinated water) onto another person&#8217;s land. Options (1) and (4) are incorrect because occupiers liability and <br/>the British Columbia Occupiers Liability Act concern the liability of an occupier for injury suffered by visitors <br/>entering their own premises, not for losses occurring on someone else&#8217;s property. Option (3) is incorrect because <br/>a patent defect is a defect in property that can be discovered during the course of a reasonable inspection. On <br/>the facts of this question, there is no indication that the leak was caused by any defect in the property of either <br/>Margaret or the neighbour.  <br/></p>
<p>Question 540 <br/>Answer: 1 <br/>Option (1) is correct because the income approach would not usually be used for the valuation of single-family <br/>residences. Options (2), (3) and (4) are incorrect because this approach can be used in appraising most types of <br/>property, although it is more appropriate for properties that produce rental income, e.g., apartment buildings, <br/>office buildings, industrial space.  <br/></p>
<p>Question 541 <br/>Answer: 2 <br/>Option (2) is correct because, after a contract has been made, but before it has been performed, it will be <br/>frustrated if events outside of the control of the parties destroy the subject matter of the contract. Options (1) <br/>and (3) are incorrect because, on the facts of this question, neither Allan nor Bob made a mistake relating to the <br/>contract. Option (4) is incorrect because the effect of frustration is the termination of the contract. In other <br/>words, the contract is ended at the point of frustration, and future rights and liabilities no longer apply. <br/>Termination is distinct from rescission in that rescission operates to &#8220;unmake&#8221; a contract, attempting to return <br/>the parties back to the position they were in prior to entering the contract. <br/></p>
<p>Question 542 <br/>Answer: 4 <br/>Option (4) is correct because most mortgages contain a term which states that the mortgagee (the lender) shall <br/>not be bound for any reason whatsoever to advance any part of the money to the mortgagor (the borrower). If, <br/>for example, a builder&#8217;s lien is filed against the property, the lender may require the removal of the lien before <br/>advancing funds. Option (1) is incorrect because a lender may require a guarantor as a form of additional <br/>security for the loan. Option (2) is incorrect because the Strata Property Act provides that a lender can obtain <br/>the right to vote at meetings of the strata corporation on matters relating to insurance, maintenance, finance or <br/>other matters affecting the security of the mortgage. Option (3) is incorrect because lenders are generally given <br/>complete discretion to select from the available remedies. This ensures that lenders are given the greatest <br/>possible chance to recover their losses resulting from a borrower default. </p>


<p>Question 543 <br/>Answer: 2 <br/>Option (2) is correct because it is in the buyer&#8217;s (not the seller&#8217;s) best interests to incorporate a Property <br/>Disclosure Statement (PDS) into the contract of purchase and sale. Doing so incorporates the warranties made <br/>by the seller in the PDS into the contract of purchase and sale, which allows the buyer to sue the seller for <br/>breach of contract if such warranties are breached. Option (1) is incorrect because it allows the seller to review <br/>the buyer&#8217;s progress with regards to the fulfilment of the condition and decide whether or not to extend the <br/>time limit or to terminate the agreement. Option (3) is incorrect because if such a covenant is inserted into the <br/>contract of purchase and sale, and the buyer does not use his or her best efforts to satisfy the specific condition, <br/>the seller can sue the buyer for breach of contract. Option (4) is incorrect because a including a 72-hour &#8220;time <br/>clause&#8221; allows the seller to demand that the buyer remove the condition precedent within 72 hours in the event <br/>that the seller receives another offer. If the buyer fails to do so, then the seller can accept the other offer.  <br/></p>
<p>Question 544 <br/>Answer: 4 <br/>Option (4) is correct because when a comparable property is sold subject to a low interest rate, the comparable <br/>sale price must be adjusted downward. Option (1) is false because the comparable property can be used as <br/>evidence of market value, as long as an adjustment is made for the &#8220;cheap&#8221; financing provided by the vendor. <br/>Option (2) is false because the comparable sale price must be adjusted downward to compensate for the benefit <br/>provided by the below-market interest rate on the mortgage. Option (3) is false because the price of the <br/>comparable property needs to be adjusted to its cash-equivalent price.  <br/></p>

<p>Question 547  <br/>Answer: 3 <br/>To answer this question, calculate the maximum amount of money that can be lent out given the two <br/>constraints: the loan-to-value amount and the gross debt service ratio amount. Calculate the loan amount for <br/>the loan-to-value constraint and then calculate the loan amount for the GDSR constraint. In order to determine <br/>the maximum amount that the lender will advance, choose the lesser of the two results.  <br/> <br/>LTV = 80%  <br/> <br/></p>
<p>Lending Value = $238,000  <br/>Maximum loan under lender&#8217;s LTV criteria = 0.8 &#215; $238,000 = $190,400  <br/> <br/></p>
<p>GDSR = 28%  <br/> <br/></p>
<p>P+I+T P+I+$1,750GDSR = 0.28 =<br/>GI $85,000<br/></p>
<p>&#8594;   <br/> <br/></p>
<p>P+I = (GDSR &#215; GI) &#8211; T  <br/>P+I = (0.28 &#215; $85,000) &#8211; $1,750  <br/>P+I = $22,050 (annual mortgage payment)  <br/> <br/></p>
<p>The loan states that monthly payments are required so:  <br/> <br/></p>
<p>P+I = $22,050 &#247; 12 = $1,837.50 (monthly mortgage payment)  <br/> </p>


<p>The next step is to calculate the maximum loan amount given the contract terms and the monthly payment. <br/> <br/>Press Display <br/>12 &#61568; NOM%  12 <br/>1 &#61568; P/YR 1 <br/>&#61568; EFF% 12 <br/>12 &#61568; P/YR 12 <br/>&#61568; NOM%  11.386552 <br/>1837.5 +/&#61473; PMT &#61473;1,837.5 <br/>180 N 180 <br/>0 FV 0 <br/>PV  158,270.459718 <br/> <br/>The maximum loan under the GDSR is $158,270, rounded to the nearest $10. <br/> <br/>The maximum loan amount is the lower of the two constraints: $158,270 &lt; $190,400; therefore, $158,270 is the <br/>maximum amount this lender will advance.  <br/></p>
<p>Question 548 <br/>Answer: 2 <br/>Option (2) is correct because an option to purchase clause, if exercised, would deny the borrower his or her <br/>right to redeem title to the property upon repayment of the loan. In other words, if the bank exercised the <br/>option and chose to purchase the property, then the borrower would necessarily be unable to redeem title upon <br/>repayment. Option (1) is incorrect because collateral advantage clauses are no longer considered clogs on the <br/>borrower&#8217;s equity of redemption, even if they extend beyond the term of the mortgage. Option (3) is incorrect <br/>because indemnity clauses do not constitute clogs on the equity of redemption, and are instead rendered <br/>unenforceable by section 8(1) of the federal Interest Act. Option (4) is incorrect because an acceleration clause is <br/>a term in the mortgage contract which makes the outstanding balance of the loan immediately due and payable <br/>if the borrower defaults. Acceleration clauses do not interfere with the borrower&#8217;s right to redeem title upon <br/>repayment, since they operate in situations where the borrower has defaulted. <br/></p>
<p>Question 549 <br/>Answer: 3 <br/>Option (3) is correct because the remedy of distress allows a commercial landlord to seize and sell a tenant&#8217;s <br/>personal property in order to satisfy a claim for rent owing. This is the most effective remedy because it <br/>immediately gives the landlord tangible assets which can be sold to recover the debt. Option (1) is incorrect <br/>because a tenant may choose to disobey an injunction, which would require that the landlord take additional <br/>legal action against them. Option (2) is incorrect because the third party to whom the garnishing order is served <br/>may still disobey the garnishing order. There are also additional limitations to this remedy, including a limit on <br/>the percentage that may be garnished from an employee&#8217;s wages. Option (4) is incorrect because a demand <br/>letter may be ignored by the tenant, in which case the landlord would be required to pursue additional action. </p>


<p>Question 550 <br/>Answer: 1 <br/>Option (1) is correct because, at common law, where an agent does not disclose to a third party that he or she is <br/>acting as an agent, the agent may be held liable as a principal. This rule is justified because the third party was <br/>led to believe that it was making a contract with the agent personally, and might not have chosen to enter a <br/>contract with the principal had they been aware of the principal&#8217;s existence and/or identity. Option (2) is <br/>incorrect because the contract is not between the agent and the principal, but is instead between the principal <br/>and the third party (though the agent may be held liable as a principal, as mentioned previously). Option (3) is <br/>incorrect because the contract remains between the principal and the third party, and therefore, the principal <br/>may sue the third party to enforce it. Option (4) is incorrect because an agent&#8217;s failure to disclose their status as <br/>an agent does not render a contract void.  <br/></p>
<p>Question 551 <br/>Answer: 1 <br/>Option (1) is correct because a constant payment mortgage has identical periodic payments. Options (2) and (3) <br/>describe a straight line principal reduction loan. Option (4) is incorrect because the constant payment is <br/>apportioned to varying levels of principal and interest. <br/></p>
<p>Question 552 <br/>Answer: 1 <br/>Option (1) is correct because the Real Estate Services Rules prohibit a licensee from making inducement <br/>promises of this nature unless the licensee gives a signed statement containing the details of the promise to the <br/>person to whom the promise is made. A licensee who breaches this prohibition may be suspended by the <br/>British Columbia Financial Services Authority. Options (2), (3), and (4) are incorrect because none of these <br/>scenarios alleviate the licensee&#8217;s obligation to give a signed statement, setting forth the details of the promise, to <br/>the person to whom the promise is being made. <br/></p>
<p>Question 553 <br/>Answer: 2 <br/>Option (2) is correct because the municipal council is not required to wait at least six months before approving <br/>an amendment to a zoning bylaw. Option (1) is incorrect because any rezoning bylaw must be given four <br/>readings by the municipal council, meaning that the council must vote in favour of the bylaw four separate <br/>times. Option (3) is incorrect because subdivision bylaws, made under the Local Government Act, may require <br/>that an owner dedicate up to five percent of his or her land for park purposes. In addition, sometimes an <br/>applicant will be required to pay for the widening of roads. Option (4) is incorrect because after a proposed <br/>rezoning bylaw receives a favourable first (or sometimes second) reading, a public hearing is usually held. At <br/>the hearing, the applicant may be required to give a short presentation, and will be asked questions about the <br/>proposal by the municipal council. <br/></p>
<p>Question 554 <br/>Answer: 3 <br/>Option (3) is correct because in relation to the subject property, this comparable requires an adjustment of <br/>+$4,000 for 1 bedroom and +$5,700 for 1 bathroom. Options (1), (2), and (4) are therefore incorrect. </p>


<p>Question 555 <br/>Answer: 3 <br/>Option (3) is correct because, in addition to compensating victims of fraud, the Assurance Fund also provides <br/>compensation to individuals who have suffered loss or damages caused, solely or partially, by an omission, <br/>mistake or misfeasance of the registrar or employees of the Land Title Office. Options (1), (2), and (4) are <br/>incorrect because a claimant must prove the following to successfully claim against the Assurance Fund in <br/>British Columbia: (a) that the claimant has lost an interest in land as a result of the registration of a person other <br/>than the claimant as owner; (b) that the claimant cannot recover that estate or interest (or compensation for it) <br/>by a court action; and (c) that, if the Land Title Act had not been passed, the claimant would have recovered the <br/>estate or interest at common law by a court action.  <br/></p>
<p>Question 556 <br/>Answer: 3 <br/>Option (3) is correct because when using the comparative approach of appraisal to value properties with <br/>redevelopment potential, it is not necessary that the comparables and the subject property have a market value <br/>of zero in their current use. Options (1), (2), and (4) are incorrect because it is necessary that they have a similar <br/>highest and best use after redevelopment, have a similar current use, and expect to undergo redevelopment at a <br/>similar point in time. <br/></p>
<p>Question 557 <br/>Answer: 3 <br/>Option (3) is correct because section 54 of the Law and Equity Act provides that where a condition precedent is <br/>for the sole benefit of the buyer, the buyer is allowed to unilaterally waive the condition prior to its expiration. <br/>Section 54 overrides the common law rule preventing the unilateral waiver of a true condition precedent. <br/>Option (1) is incorrect because the agreement remains valid and enforceable in this situation. Options (2) and <br/>(4) are incorrect because, in this situation, the agreement does not become voidable at either the option of the <br/>seller or the buyer. <br/></p>
<p>Question 558 <br/>Answer: 3 <br/>Option (3) is correct because, with respect to commercial tenancies, the implied covenant of quiet enjoyment <br/>does not simply refer to freedom from noise; rather, it is an assurance to the tenant against the consequences of <br/>defective title. This means that if the landlord, or anyone who claims to have received rights from the landlord, <br/>attacks the tenant&#8217;s right to the premises, it would breach this covenant. Option (1) is incorrect because the <br/>implied covenant of quiet enjoyment does not concern competition with the tenant&#8217;s business. Option (2) is <br/>incorrect because the implied covenant of quiet enjoyment is an implied promise given by the landlord to the <br/>tenant, and does not restrict the tenant&#8217;s own conduct on the property. Option (4) is incorrect because the <br/>implied covenant of quiet enjoyment does not constitute a guarantee by the landlord that other tenants will <br/>comply with local noise bylaws. </p>

<p>Question 560 <br/>Answer: 4 <br/>Option (4) is correct because a restrictive covenant is an interest in land which can be registered at the Land <br/>Title Office. Once a valid restrictive covenant has been registered, it binds subsequent owners of the property <br/>(i.e., it &#8220;runs with the land&#8221;). Therefore, the covenantor (the person who agrees to be bound by the restriction) <br/>need not retain the restricted property for the restrictive covenant to remain valid. Option (1) is incorrect <br/>because, in order to be a valid restrictive covenant, an owner must be able to comply with the covenant by not <br/>doing something. If a covenant requires action it is a &#8220;positive&#8221; covenant, and does not run with the land. <br/>Options (2) and (3) are both incorrect because each statement is one of the five essential requirements of a valid <br/>restrictive covenant. <br/></p>
<p>Question 561 <br/>Answer: 3 <br/>Option (3) is correct because an agent owes a duty of loyalty to the principal, which requires them to disclose to <br/>the principal all facts relevant to the transaction within the agent&#8217;s knowledge. The complete disclosure <br/>requirement prohibits an agent from making a &#8220;secret&#8221; profit, meaning that the agent must disclose all of the <br/>benefits and prospective benefits received by the agent as a result of, or in the course of, performing duties on <br/>behalf of the principal. Option (1) is incorrect because the agent is not required to disclose all of their personal <br/>business dealings to the principal if those dealings do not affect the interests of the principal. Option (2) is <br/>incorrect because the agent is not required to inform the principal of their own annual tax return, as this <br/>information does not affect the interests of the principal. Option (4) is incorrect because an agent has a duty to <br/>disclose all relevant facts that could influence the conduct of the principal. This duty is not limited to situations <br/>where the agent is receiving actual profits, and extends to situations where the agent will suffer a loss. <br/></p>
<p>Question 562 <br/>Answer: 4 <br/>Option (4) is correct because gross potential revenue is estimated using current market rents paid on similar <br/>properties. Even when the subject or comparable property is fully rented, the rents used in determining the <br/>property&#8217;s net operating income should be compared to current rental prices. Therefore, Options (1), (2), and (3) <br/>are incorrect. </p>


<p>Question 563 <br/>Answer: 2 <br/>Option (2) is correct because the Strata Property Act gives strata corporations the ability to grant an owner or <br/>tenant permission to exclusively use common property for a period of less than one year. If the permission does <br/>not involve a significant change in the use or appearance of the common property, then the permission can be <br/>granted by a majority vote of the strata council. Option (1) is incorrect because approval by a &#190; vote, rather than <br/>a simple majority vote, at a general meeting of the strata corporation is only required where the permission or <br/>privilege granted involves a significant change in the use or appearance of the property. Option (3) is incorrect <br/>because permission to exclusively use common property may only be granted for less than one year, whereas <br/>the designation of limited common property has no fixed duration and need not be renewed. Therefore, the <br/>permission to exclusively use common property cannot be identical to the designation of limited common <br/>property. Option (4) is incorrect because the strata corporation may grant the permission for up to one year. <br/></p>
<p>Question 564 <br/>Answer: 3 <br/>Option (3) is correct because a Board of Variance does not have the jurisdiction to amend zoning bylaws. <br/>Instead, the function of a Board of Variance is to permit minor exceptions, or &#8220;variances&#8221;, to existing bylaws, <br/>without altering the bylaws themselves. Amending zoning bylaws is the responsibility of municipal councils <br/>and regional districts. Options (1), (2), and (4) are incorrect because a Board of Variance is given the authority to <br/>hear appeals in situations where the enforcement of a bylaw would cause undue hardship. To achieve this <br/>purpose, the Board may permit a structural alteration to a building used for a non-conforming use, and may <br/>establish time limits within which construction of a variance must be completed. <br/></p>
<p>Question 565 <br/>Answer: 2 <br/>Option (2) is correct because the REALTOR&#174; Code of Ethics is enforced by the local real estate boards in British <br/>Columbia. Option (1) is incorrect because, while the Canadian Real Estate Association establishes the <br/>REALTOR&#174; Code of Ethics, enforcement occurs at the local board level. Option (3) is incorrect because the <br/>British Columbia Real Estate Association is responsible for representing the interests of local real estate boards, <br/>and their members on provincial matters, and does not directly enforce the REALTOR&#174; Code of Ethics. Option <br/>(4) is incorrect because the British Columbia Financial Services Authority (&#8220;BCFSA&#8221;) is a statutory body tasked <br/>with administering the Real Estate Services Act (RESA) and related regulations, and rules. The REALTOR&#174; Code <br/>of Ethics is set by the Canadian Real Estate Association, which is a professional trade organization that is <br/>separate from BCFSA. <br/></p>
<p>Question 566 <br/>Answer: 1 <br/>Option (1) is correct because a real estate trade record sheet is required for each transaction in which the <br/>brokerage or a related licensee holds or receives money. Since listing a property on the MLS&#174; listing occurs <br/>prior to such a transaction, this information does not need to be included in the record sheet. Options (2), (3), <br/>and (4) are incorrect because each contains information that is necessary to accurately describe and record real <br/>estate transactions. </p>


<p>Question 567 <br/>Answer: 2 <br/>Option (2) is correct because section 15 of the Manufactured Home Act provides that no person may move a <br/>manufactured home unless it is registered in the manufactured homes registry. Additionally, section 18(1) <br/>requires that a transport permit be obtained from the registrar to authorize the movement of the home to a <br/>specific location. Option (1) is incorrect because the ownership, transfer and granting of charges of <br/>manufactured homes are not registered in the land title office. Option (3) is incorrect because a manufactured <br/>home with a security interest registered against it in the personal property registry can still be moved. The <br/>secured party remains protected because registrar is required to notify the secured party when an application <br/>for a transport permit is made. Option (4) is incorrect because, in certain cases, a landlord, a secured party, or <br/>any other person acting under a court order may obtain a transport permit authorizing them to move a <br/>manufactured home. <br/></p>
<p>Question 568 <br/>Answer: 3 <br/>Option (3) in correct because joint tenants enjoy the right of survivorship, meaning that when one joint tenant <br/>dies, the entire estate automatically vests in the surviving joint tenant(s). Bert, therefore, became the sole owner <br/>of the revenue producing property immediately upon Ernie&#8217;s death and Ernie had no interest to dispose of in <br/>his will. Options (1) and (2) are incorrect because no interest in the property passed to Grover. Option (4) is <br/>incorrect because a joint tenant cannot sever a joint tenancy merely by bequeathing their interest in the <br/>property to a third party in their will. To sever the joint tenancy Ernie would have had to (a) destroy one of the <br/>four &#8220;unities&#8221; required for a joint tenancy to exist (e.g., by selling or mortgaging his estate); (b) partition the <br/>property via a mutual agreement with Bert; or (c) obtain a court order for partition. <br/></p>
<p>Question 569 <br/>Answer: 1 <br/>Option (1) is correct because section 20(1) of the Land Title Act provides that &#8220;except as against the person <br/>making it&#8221;, an unregistered transfer deed is inoperative. This section indicates that an unregistered deed <br/>remains operative between the transferor and the transferee. Option (2) is incorrect because it is a long standing <br/>common law rule that a forged deed is void from the beginning. Option (3) is incorrect because, where the <br/>consideration given exchange for a deed amounts to an illegal act or thing, the transfer deed is void. Option (4) <br/>is incorrect because where a party can successfully plead non est factum (&#8220;that is not my deed&#8221;) the deed in <br/>question will be rendered void for reason of unilateral mistake. <br/></p>
<p>Question 570 <br/>Answer: 3 <br/>Option (3) is correct because, since a sole proprietorship is a business enterprise owned by a single individual, <br/>the owner of a proprietorship is personally liable for all the debts incurred by the proprietorship. This means <br/>that, if the proprietorship is unable to pay its debts, the proprietorship&#8217;s creditors may collect from the personal <br/>assets of the owner. Option (1) is incorrect because, since a proprietorship is not regarded as a separate legal <br/>entity from the owner, it is terminated upon the death of the owner. Option (2) is incorrect because the profits of <br/>a proprietorship accrue to the owner and are taxed as part of his or her personal income. Option (4) is incorrect <br/>because, as stated previously, a proprietorship is not regarded as a separate legal entity from the owner, and the <br/>owner has unlimited liability. </p>


<p>Question 571 <br/>Answer: 2 <br/>Option (2) is correct because Ralph will likely be able to establish the three elements required for a successful <br/>negligence claim: (1) that XYZ, a company storing highly toxic gasses, owed him a duty of care as his neighbour; <br/>(2) that XYZ breached the standard of care by allowing the gas to drift over Ralph&#8217;s apple orchard; and (3) that <br/>the damage to Ralph&#8217;s orchard was reasonably foreseeable (i.e. not too remote). Option (1) is incorrect because <br/>trespass is an intentional tort, and consequently must be a direct, voluntary act, as opposed to an indirect result <br/>of an act. In this case, there is no indication that Hurston or the President intended to release the gas over <br/>Ralph&#8217;s apple orchard. Option (3) is incorrect because a fiduciary duty is only owed by a person who holds a <br/>legally significant position of trust with respect to someone else, and is obliged, by virtue of that relationship or <br/>trust, to act solely for the other person&#8217;s benefit. There is no indication, on the facts provided, that XYZ was in <br/>such a relationship of trust with Ralph. Option (4) is incorrect because the Occupiers Liability Act would only <br/>apply if Ralph had suffered damage while on XYZ&#8217;s premises.  <br/></p>
<p>Question 572 <br/>Answer: 1 <br/>Option (1) is correct because the Regulations passed under the Residential Tenancy Act provide that a security <br/>deposit for a residential tenancy agreement cannot exceed one half of the monthly rent. Options (2), (3), and (4) <br/>are incorrect because each of these amounts exceeds the amount permitted under the Act. <br/></p>
<p>Question 573 <br/>Answer: 1 <br/>For this question, with a given monthly periodic rate, calculate how many years Joe will make payments. First, <br/>express the rate as a j12, then calculate N. <br/> <br/>Press Display <br/>.75 &#215; 12 = I/YR 9 <br/>12 &#61568; P/YR 12 <br/>11000 PV 11,000 <br/>335 +/&#61473; PMT &#61473;335 <br/>0 FV 0 <br/>N  37.837088 (months) <br/>&#247; 12 = 3.153091 (years) <br/> <br/>N is expressed as months; therefore, divide by 12 to express the amortization in years. Joe will have to make <br/>payments for three full years.  <br/></p>
<p>Question 574 <br/>Answer: 2 <br/>Option (2) is correct because when mortgage interest rates are casually referenced, it is typically a nominal <br/>interest rate. Therefore, Options (1), (3), and (4) are incorrect. </p>


<p>Question 575 <br/>Answer: 2  <br/>Option (2) is correct because Charlotte effectively revived her original offer (to sell her property to Dennis for <br/>$180,000), which Dennis then accepted. Dennis&#8217; offer of $165,000 was a counter-offer, which therefore <br/>terminated the original offer. However, Charlotte made her own counter-offer when she replied, &#8220;cannot reduce <br/>price&#8221;, which effectively renewed her original offer. Option (1) is incorrect because the case of Livingstone v. <br/>Evans tells us that the words &#8220;cannot reduce price&#8221;, uttered in this context, renew the original offer. Dennis was <br/>therefore entitled to accept the renewed offer. Option (3) is incorrect because Charlotte&#8217;s initial email contained <br/>the necessary terms (the property and the price) to constitute an offer capable of being accepted, and therefore <br/>was more than a mere invitation to treat. Option (4) is incorrect because Options (1) and (3) are both incorrect. <br/></p>
<p>Question 576 <br/>Answer: 4 <br/>Option (4) is correct because this extract is taken from section 59(3)(a) of the Law and Equity Act. Therefore, <br/>Options (1), (2), and (3) are incorrect. <br/></p>
<p>Question 577 <br/>Answer: 3  <br/>Option (3) is correct because if a qualified home inspector would have identified the issue, it would likely be <br/>classified as a patent defect, which sellers do not have an obligation to disclose. As a buyer, Anna has a duty to <br/>conduct a reasonable inspection and make reasonable inquiries to ensure that there are no patent defects, <br/>which typically involves consulting a licensed home inspector. Option (1) is incorrect because, even for major <br/>issues, the seller is only required to disclose latent defects that he or she knows or should have reasonably <br/>known. Option (2) is incorrect because sellers are required to disclose known latent defects that render the <br/>property dangerous or unfit for habitation, even if the buyer did not specifically ask about that defect. Option <br/>(4) is incorrect because the defect&#8217;s impact on the property can be objectively determined at a value of $55,000 <br/>and therefore cannot be classified as a stigma.  <br/></p>
<p>Question 578 <br/>Answer: 4 <br/>Option (4) is correct because a common mistake occurs when both parties to a contract make the same mistake <br/>about a fundamental term of the contract, such as the existence of what is being sold. In this case, the fact that <br/>the cottage had been destroyed prior to the formation of the contract was unknown to both parties. The <br/>existence of a common mistake such as this renders a contract void. Option (1) is incorrect because a mutual <br/>mistake occurs when both parties make a fundamental mistake about the contract but each makes a different <br/>mistake. Here, the mistake was the same (the assumption that the cottage still existed). Option (2) is incorrect <br/>because frustration occurs where a specific thing that is necessary for the performance of the contract is no <br/>longer in existence at the time for performance. In this case, the cottage was destroyed before the contract was <br/>entered into, meaning that frustration does not apply. Option (3) is incorrect because (a) there is no indication <br/>that Jem did not understand the nature of the contract of sale; and (b) the mistake regarding the existence of the <br/>cottage was a common mistake, not a unilateral mistake since both Jem and Boo were mistaken. </p>


<p>Question 579 <br/>Answer: 3 <br/>Option (3) is correct because it is false. The duty of confidentiality to a client lasts forever. Option (1) is incorrect <br/>because actions that are unlawful would be against the duty of acting in the client&#8217;s best interest. Option (2) is <br/>incorrect because section 45 of the Real Estate Services Rules requires licensees to obtain written authorization <br/>to sign agreements on behalf of their clients. Option (4) is incorrect because full disclosure requires licensees <br/>disclose to their clients all known material information, no matter how trivial. <br/></p>
<p>Question 580 <br/>Answer: 1 <br/>Option (1) is correct because one of the undesirable aspects of the common law pertaining to contracts is that <br/>when no mention of the state of title is made in the contract beneficial ownership, and therefore risk of loss or <br/>damage, passes to the buyer at the time the contract is signed. The standard form Contract of Purchase and Sale <br/>in BC expressly alters this common law presumption. Options (2), (3), and (4) are therefore incorrect. <br/></p>
<p>Question 581  <br/>Answer: 1 <br/>Option (1) is correct because the key purpose of the Disclosure of Representation in Trading Services form is to <br/>ensure that consumers understand how trading services can be provided to them, so that they can provide <br/>informed consent to the chosen form of relationship with the real estate licensee. Options (2), (3), and (4) are <br/>incorrect for this reason. <br/></p>
<p>Question 582 <br/>Answer: 1 <br/>Option (1) is correct because licensees have a duty to present all options to a client (which includes all offers) <br/>unless the client has given specific instructions to somehow limit which offers are to be presented. Options (2), <br/>(3), and (4) are incorrect because all three offers must be presented to your client. <br/></p>
<p>Question 583 <br/>Answer: 2 <br/>Option (2) is correct because a borrower who grants a legal mortgage retains an equitable interest in the <br/>property. The borrower is free to mortgage this equitable interest by granting a second, or subsequent, <br/>mortgage. These subsequent mortgages are mortgages on the borrower&#8217;s equity of redemption (the borrower&#8217;s <br/>right to repay the mortgage and redeem title to the property). Option (1) is incorrect because, though also a form <br/>of security interest, a lien is not a mortgage. Options (3) and (4) are incorrect because agreements for sale and <br/>leases are not mortgages. </p>


<p>Question 584 <br/>Answer: 1 <br/>Option (1) is correct because, at the first court appearance where a claim for foreclosure is brought, a judge will <br/>generally grant an order nisi. The order nisi is an important preliminary step because it sets the final <br/>redemption period, during which the respondents can redeem the mortgage by paying the amount due and <br/>owing. Options (2) and (3) are incorrect because orders absolute and orders for sale may be obtained if payment <br/>is not made within the redemption period set by the order nisi. Option (4) is incorrect because an order for <br/>specific performance may be available in the case of an agreement for sale, but is not an available remedy for <br/>foreclosure actions. <br/></p>
<p>Question 585 <br/>Answer: 2 <br/>Option (2) is correct because mortgages payable represents a debt that must be repaid. Option (1) is incorrect <br/>because accumulated depreciation is part of the assets section on the balance sheet, and takes away from the <br/>value of the depreciable asset(s). Options (3) and (4) are incorrect because wages paid is listed as an expense, <br/>and prepaid expenses are listed as a current asset. <br/></p>
<p>Question 586 <br/>Answer: 2 <br/>Option (2) is correct because revaluing assets is inconsistent with the cost principle. Option (1) is consistent with <br/>the matching principle, Option (3) is consistent with the consistency principle, and Option (4) is consistent with <br/>the revenue recognition principle. <br/></p>
<p>Question 587 <br/>Answer: 2 <br/>Option (2) is correct because a secondary mortgage market is the market in which existing mortgages are <br/>bought and sold between investors. Options (1), (3), and (4) are incorrect. <br/></p>
<p>Question 588 <br/>Answer: 3 <br/>If the investor can earn j12 = 6% on other investments, the purchase price of the mortgage should be based on a <br/>market value of j12 = 6%. First, calculate the mortgage payment based on the contract rate of j12 = 3.5%.

<p>Question 589 <br/>Answer: 4 <br/>Option (4) is correct because constant payment loans were developed in response to the risk to the lender of <br/>default on principal. The constant payment reduces this risk as each periodic payment reduces the amount of <br/>principal at risk. Options (1), (2), and (3) are incorrect. <br/></p>
<p>Question 590 <br/>Answer: 3 <br/>Option (3) is correct because common area charges could be applicable to condominiums only, as <br/>condominiums consist of a tenancy in common interest in the common areas of the development, while some <br/>other types of real property do not. Options (1), (2), and (4) are incorrect because location and neighbourhood, <br/>quality of construction, and the interest rate on the mortgage are applicable to all types of property, not just <br/>condominiums. <br/></p>

<p>Question 595 <br/>Answer: 4 <br/>The first step in answering this question is to calculate the payments based on the terms of the contract.

<p>Question 596 <br/>Answer: 3 <br/>Option (3) is correct because reducing the loan-to-value ratio is the only option listed that the mortgagee can <br/>ensure there is sufficient security against the loan. Options (1), (2), and (4) are incorrect because a longer <br/>amortization period, smaller monthly payment, or lower debt coverage ratio will not guarantee sufficient <br/>security against the loan or that the borrowers are in a financial position that will enable them to make the <br/>necessary payments. </p>


<p>Question 597 <br/>Answer: 4 <br/>To calculate the maximum loan amount, calculate the loan amounts based on both the constraint of the <br/>loan-to-value ratio and the gross debt service ratio. The loan-to-value is calculated based on the bank&#8217;s <br/>appraisal of the property. In this case, the amount the bank appraises the property at is $275,000. Once the <br/>payments from the GDSR are calculated, the PV of the loan is calculated, taking into consideration the stress <br/>test qualification rules. The loan amount that satisfies both constraints (the smaller amount) will be the <br/>maximum loan amount.  <br/> <br/>LTV = 80% <br/></p>
<p> <br/>Lending Value = $275,000 <br/>Maximum loan under lender&#8217;s LTV criteria = 0.8 &#215; $275,000 = $220,000 <br/></p>
<p> <br/>GDSR = 32%  <br/></p>
<p>P + I = (GDSR &#215; Gross Income) &#8211; Property Taxes <br/>P + I = (0.32 &#215; $50,000) &#8211; $1,800  <br/>P + I = $14,200 per year = $1,183.33 per month <br/></p>

<p>Question 599 <br/>Answer: 3 <br/>Option (3) is correct because British Columbia&#8217;s regular tax deferral program will allow Mrs. Joseph to make an <br/>application to defer up to 100% of the net property taxes payable on the property, since it will be here principal <br/>place of residence. Assuming that Mrs. Joseph is either a Canadian citizen or a permanent resident, and that she <br/>would have a minimum equity of 25% in the property if she purchased it, she would likely qualify for the <br/>regular program given that she is both 55 and a widow. Option (1) is incorrect because a reverse annuity <br/>mortgage is a type of mortgage that can function to supplement the income of aged persons who already own <br/>their home, not as a way to reduce mortgage payments where a new home is being purchased. Option (2) is <br/>incorrect because the property is the only residential property in an area of commercial development. While <br/>section 19(8) of the Assessment Act permits certain residential properties to be assessed according to the value <br/>based solely on their current residential use, Mrs. Joseph would not qualify for this special assessment because <br/>she has not lived continuously in the residence for ten years. Option (4) is incorrect because Mrs. Joseph would <br/>only qualify for the basic home owner grant, which cannot be used to reduce total property taxes below <br/>$350.00. <br/></p>
<p>Question 600 <br/>Answer: 1 <br/>Option (1) is the correct answer as a hard change is the establishment of a new metric standard size, such as <br/>150mm. Options (2), (3), and (4) are incorrect. <br/></p>
<p>Question 601 <br/>Answer: 1 <br/>Option (1) is correct because convection heat transfer occurs when the baseboard heating unit warms the air in <br/>the room. As the air around the baseboard unit warms, the warmer air rises and cooler air falls, creating a <br/>convective current in the room. Options (2), (3), and (4) are incorrect as they do not describe the principal way <br/>that such a heating system provides most of its heat transfer. <br/></p>

<p>Question 603 <br/>Answer: 3 <br/>To find the adjusted sale price of the comparable, take the sum of the listed sale price with its adjustments to the <br/>subject property. In this case, the subject property and the comparable are identical except that the subject <br/>property has 1 additional bedroom and 100 square feet less. The adjusted sale price is: $225,800 + $3,200 <br/>&#8211;$6,000 = $223,000. <br/></p>
<p>Question 604 <br/>Answer: 3 <br/>Option (3) is correct because in the comparative approach of appraisal, it is most important that the subject <br/>building and the comparable buildings be similar with respect to factors judged important by buyers and <br/>sellers. Options (1), (2), and (4) are incorrect because similarity is only required for those factors that have a <br/>major influence on buyers and sellers, and the sale prices they negotiate. <br/></p>
<p>Question 605 <br/>Answer: 3 <br/>Option (3) is correct because if the cost of developing houses is greater than their market value, development <br/>will stop in the short run until market values rise.

<p>Question 607 <br/>Answer: 2 <br/>Option (2) is correct (false) because the vacancy allowance should be determined by the long-term vacancy rates <br/>in the area; that is, the vacancies in comparable buildings modified, if necessary, by expected future trends. <br/>Options (1), (3), and (4) are incorrect because they are true. <br/></p>
<p>Question 608 <br/>Answer: 3 <br/>Option (3) is correct because functional incurable depreciation refers to outdated features that cannot be easily <br/>corrected, such as narrow hallways. Options (1), (2), and (4) are incorrect because these are relatively easily <br/>corrected. <br/></p>
<p>Question 609 <br/>Answer: 2 <br/>Option (2) is the correct answer: explaining the marketing program during a listing presentation will help a <br/>client understand what benefits the licensee is providing. Options (1), (3), and (4) are all ways that a licensee can <br/>effectively communicate the value of their services to a potential client in a listing presentation. <br/></p>
<p>Question 610 <br/>Answer: 4 <br/>Option (4) is correct because the Multiple Listing Service&#174; serves many functions, including computing listing <br/>searches, producing automated hot sheets, and generating Comparative Market Analysis (CMA) presentations <br/>and other client prospecting tools. Options (1), (2), and (3) are therefore incorrect. <br/></p>
<p>Question 611 <br/>Answer: 2 <br/>Option (2) is correct because a licensee is required to meet the educational and experience requirement <br/>appropriate to the level of licence for which the application is made. In addition to meeting the educational <br/>requirements for a representative licence, to qualify for a managing broker&#8217;s licence, a person must have been <br/>providing real estate services British Columbia or an equivalent jurisdiction for at least two years during the <br/>five years before the date of the application. Option (1) is incorrect because, while brokerages are required to <br/>keep certain specified financial records (section 25 of RESA), persons applying for managing broker&#8217;s licences <br/>do not need to submit personal financial statements for each licensee they intend to hire. Option (3) is incorrect <br/>because, as mentioned previously, an applicant&#8217;s licensed experience can come from British Columbia or an <br/>equivalent jurisdiction. Option (4) is incorrect because Options (1) and (3) are incorrect. </p>


<p>Question 612 <br/>Answer: 2 <br/>Option (2) is correct because the Real Estate Services Act requires that a person who provides &#8220;real estate <br/>services&#8221; on behalf of another for or in expectation of remuneration must be licensed. There is no licensing <br/>requirement for persons like Alan, who perform real estate services without receiving or expecting any money <br/>or reward. Option (1) is incorrect for the same reason. Option (3) is incorrect because &#8220;real estate services&#8221; are <br/>not limited to the writing of the contract of purchase and sale. The Real Estate Services Act defines &#8220;real estate <br/>services&#8221; as including actions such as advising on the appropriate price for real estate, making representations <br/>about a property, finding a party to acquire real estate, showing the real estate, and negotiating the price of real <br/>estate. Therefore, Alan may not perform any of these services (or any other service included in the definition of <br/>&#8220;trading services&#8221;) and receive money for it. Option (4) is incorrect because siblings are not exempt from the <br/>licensing requirement established by section 3 of the Real Estate Services Act. Therefore, if Alan is unlicensed, <br/>Peter cannot pay him for providing real estate services. <br/></p>
<p>Question 613 <br/>Answer: 3 <br/>Option (3) is correct because there is no right of survivorship in a tenancy in common. Therefore, where two <br/>people own property as tenants in common, they each may leave their interest by will to whomever they wish. <br/>Option (1) is incorrect because the essential feature of joint tenancy is the right of survivorship. This means that <br/>when one joint tenant dies, the property automatically vests in the surviving joint tenant(s). Option (2) is <br/>incorrect because all joint tenants must receive their interests at the same time and from the same document. <br/>Therefore, if one joint tenant transfers his interest to a third party, both the unity of time and the unity of title <br/>are destroyed, and the co-ownership is converted to a tenancy in common. Option (4) is incorrect for the same <br/>reason.  <br/></p>
<p>Question 614 <br/>Answer: 3 <br/>Option (3) is correct because British Columbia does not have a pure Torrens system of title registration, and <br/>therefore allows a notation of trust to be made on the title. In a pure Torrens system, no mention of a trust can <br/>appear on the register. Option (1) is incorrect because a caveat is a short-term notice registered against a title to <br/>land warning those looking at the title that a claim for an estate or interest in the property has been made. <br/>Option (2) is incorrect because a lis pendens is a term previously used for what is now called a certificate of <br/>pending litigation. Option (4) is incorrect because issuing a duplicate certificate of title does nothing to show <br/>that the property is registered in favour of a trustee. <br/></p>
<p>Question 615 <br/>Answer: 3 <br/>Option (3) is correct because the four requirements for an action for negligent misrepresentation are met: (1) <br/>Mark made an untrue statement when he told John that there was no termite problem; (2) the statement was <br/>likely negligent because, assuming that Mark was not outright lying, he failed to ascertain the necessary <br/>information regarding the termites before telling John that there was no infestation; (3) as an experienced <br/>professional giving advice to a person (John) who would reasonably rely on that advice, Mark owed John a duty <br/>of care; and (4) given the position of Mark, a real estate licensee showing a home, it was likely reasonable for <br/>John to rely on Mark&#8217;s statement. Since these four elements are likely met, Mark is likely liable to John for the <br/>repairs on the grounds of negligent misrepresentation. Option (1) is incorrect because John did not suffer loss <br/>while Mark was showing him the home. Option (2) is incorrect because private nuisance occurs where an owner <br/>or occupier of land unreasonably or substantially interferes with the reasonable use and enjoyment of a <br/>neighbouring property. Option (4) is incorrect because vicarious liability is the principle that renders <br/>employers liable for wrongful acts committed by their employees. In this case, vicarious liability may render <br/>Mark&#8217;s real estate brokerage liable for his negligent misrepresentation. </p>


<p>Question 616 <br/>Answer: 3 <br/>Option (3) is correct because there are no legal restrictions regarding security deposits in commercial tenancies. <br/>This amount is left open to negotiation. Option (1) is incorrect because the allocation of interest on security <br/>deposits in commercial tenancies is open for negotiation, and therefore may be allocated to the tenant. <br/>Additionally, the Residential Tenancy Act and the Residential Tenancy Regulation require that the landlord <br/>pay interest on a security deposit to the tenant upon termination of the tenancy. Option (2) is incorrect because, <br/>in commercial tenancies, the return of a security deposit is a personal obligation of the landlord. A purchaser is <br/>under no duty to the tenant to repay it. In residential tenancies a security deposit, and the obligation of the <br/>landlord to repay it (with interest), runs with the land. Therefore, assuming the tenancy continues after the <br/>property is transferred, the purchaser will be required to pay these amounts out to the tenant when the tenancy <br/>ends. Option (4) is incorrect because Options (1) and (2) are incorrect.  <br/></p>
<p>Question 617 <br/>Answer: 4 <br/>Option (4) is correct because the owners in a bare land strata development will be responsible for any costs <br/>associated with common property. Recreational facilities are frequently built as common property on a bare <br/>land strata development. Option (1) is incorrect because uniform appearance is typically ensured through <br/>registered building schemes and strata bylaws, rather than easement agreements. Option (2) is incorrect <br/>because title to the land on which roads are placed can be retained by the strata corporation as common <br/>property, such that the owners of the strata lots would be responsible for maintenance and repair. Option (3) is <br/>incorrect because bare land strata developments, aside from being for residential and recreational <br/>development, are often also used for industrial and commercial development. <br/></p>
<p>Question 618 <br/>Answer: 2 <br/>Option (2) is correct because, if a property is to be listed and then sold, all persons who have an ownership <br/>interest in the property must agree to the listing. Therefore, it is essential that the listing contract is signed by all <br/>of the owners. Option (1) is incorrect because the purchaser is not party to the listing contract, and therefore <br/>cannot rely on any of the terms within it. Option (3) is incorrect because a licensee who does not review the title <br/>of the listed property assumes the risk of liability to the purchaser, loss of commission, and disciplinary <br/>proceedings if a complaint is registered with the British Columbia Financial Services Authority. This remains <br/>true even if the licensee includes terms such as &#8220;approximately&#8221; or &#8220;more or less&#8221; when describing a property. <br/>Option (4) is incorrect because Options (1) and (3) are incorrect.  <br/></p>
<p>Question 619 <br/>Answer: 2 <br/>Option (2) is correct because at common law there are three situations where an agent will be personally liable <br/>to a third party. One of these situations is where the agent fails to disclose that he/she is an agent. Option (1) is <br/>incorrect because an agent will generally not be personally liable to third parties provided that the agent: (a) <br/>discloses their status as an agent; (b) has authority to act as an agent; and (c) does not commit any torts. Option <br/>(3) is incorrect because an agent may be granted authority from the principal orally, or by implication in certain <br/>cases. In either of these situations, the agent will possess legitimate authority and will not be personally liable to <br/>third parties merely for the reason do not have written authority. Option (4) is incorrect because Options (1) and <br/>(3) are incorrect. </p>


<p>Question 620 <br/>Answer: 3 <br/>Option (3) is correct because, since Victoria (the seller) has already paid the full year&#8217;s property taxes, Penny (the <br/>buyer) should reimburse Victoria for the portion of the taxes from and including the adjustment date up to the <br/>end of the year. In this case, Penny&#8217;s share of the year&#8217;s property taxes (Dec. 28 &#8211; Dec. 31 = 4 days) is calculated <br/>in the following manner: 4/365 &#215; $2,300 = $25.21. This amount will appear as a debit on Penny&#8217;s statement of <br/>adjustments. The late payment penalty incurred by Victoria will not be reflected on Penny&#8217;s statement of <br/>adjustments because it was Victoria&#8217;s responsibility to pay the property taxes on time. Therefore, Options (1), <br/>(2), and (4) are incorrect. <br/></p>
<p>Question 621 <br/>Answer: 1 <br/><b>Seller&#8217;s Statement of Adjustments (Vivian)</b> <br/><b>ITEM DEBIT CREDIT <br/></b>Purchase Price  140,000.00 <br/>Commission  8,400.00  <br/>Take Back Mortgage  8,000.00  <br/>Outstanding Mortgage 12,000.00  <br/> Buyer's Share of Taxes*  <b>     25.21</b> <br/>Penalty     85.00  <br/>Cash Proceeds of Sale** <b>111,540.21</b>  _________ <br/> 140,025.21 140,025.21 <br/>* (Dec. 28-Dec. 31 = 4 days) 4/365 &#61512; $2,300 = $25.21 <br/>** Because the total Debits and Credits must balance, in order to find the Proceeds of Sale, you must first calculate the total Credits <br/> ($140,025.21) and then subtract the known Debits. The result is the balance of cash that the seller can expect to receive after all <br/>outstanding expenses relating to the property have been paid. <br/></p>
<p>Question 622 <br/>Answer: 2 <br/>Option (2) is correct. When a deposit is paid to a real estate brokerage, the amount of the deposit will be <br/>reflected on the buyer&#8217;s statement of adjustments as a credit. It will not appear on the seller&#8217;s statement of <br/>adjustments, therefore Options (1), (3), and (4) are incorrect. <br/></p>
<p>Question 623 <br/>Answer: 3 <br/>Option (3) is correct because, where a contract has not been executed, the available remedy for innocent <br/>misrepresentation is rescission (cancellation of the contract). Option (1) is incorrect because revocation refers to <br/>the cancellation of an offer. Once a contract has been made, revocation is no longer available. Option (2) is <br/>incorrect because rectification is a remedy typically available where there has been a mistake leading to the <br/>formation of a contract, not for misrepresentation. Option (4) is incorrect because Option (3) is correct. </p>


<p>Question 624 <br/>Answer: 3 <br/>Option (3) is correct because, in the context of Lois&#8217; inquiry regarding the possibility of a lower rate, Abdul <br/>statement that his rate was $30 per hour was an offer. This was a valid offer because it contained the necessary <br/>terms for a contract to be entered into; in this case, price ($30 per hour) and subject matter (squash lessons). <br/>Option (1) is incorrect because the advertisement was most likely an invitation to treat, used by Abdul to induce <br/>radio listeners to pursue a contract for tennis lessons with him. Option (2) is incorrect for the same reason, and <br/>for the reason that Lois&#8217; call was merely an inquiry regarding the possibility of a lower rate for students. Lois <br/>did not propose a new rate, therefore, he did not make a counter-offer. Option (4) is incorrect for the same <br/>reason. <br/></p>
<p>Question 625 <br/>Answer: 4 <br/>Option (4) is correct because there must be at least one general partner in a limited partnership. The general <br/>partner(s) have unlimited liability, and can engage in the management or operations of the partnership. <br/>Options (1), (2), and (3) are all incorrect statements.  <br/></p>
<p>Question 626 <br/>Answer: 3 <br/>Option (3) is correct because joists are the horizontal framing members that support the floors. Option (1) is <br/>incorrect because joists do not support rafters. Options (2) and (4) are incorrect as the foundation is the poured <br/>concrete footprint that supports the superstructure above.  <br/></p>
<p>Question 627 <br/>Answer: 1 <br/>Option (1) is correct because an essential feature of joint tenancy is the right of survivorship. This means that <br/>when one joint tenant dies, the entire estate automatically vests in the surviving joint tenants. Option (2) is <br/>incorrect because, in British Columbia, the default form of co-ownership is tenancy in common, not joint <br/>tenancy. This means that if a document transfers a property without expressly stating the type of co-ownership, <br/>the new owners will be presumed to hold the property as tenants in common. Option (3) is incorrect because <br/>Paul severed the joint tenancy when he transferred his interest to his son and registered it at the land title office. <br/>This act converted the co-ownership of the property into a tenancy in common. Option (4) is incorrect because <br/>joint tenants enjoy a unity of possession, meaning that each co-owner is entitled to possession of the whole of <br/>the estate and no joint tenant can hold possession of any part separately and to the exclusion of others.  <br/></p>
<p>Question 628 <br/>Answer: 4 <br/>Find the property&#8217;s loan-to-value ratio using the value of the mortgage and the property&#8217;s lending value. <br/> <br/></p>

<p>Question 629 <br/>Answer: 4  <br/>The market value of Alice&#8217;s offer is the market value of the mortgage plus her cash down payment. Alice will <br/>assume the remaining 24 monthly payments of $822.06 and the outstanding balance of $108,904.49. Calculate <br/>the market value of the mortgage by determining the PV of the payments and OSB remaining at the end of the <br/>original 5-year term based on the current market rate of j2 = 8.75%. <br/> <br/>Press Display <br/>8.75 &#61568; NOM% 8.75 <br/>2 &#61568; P/YR  2 <br/>&#61568; EFF% 8.941406 <br/>12 &#61568; P/YR 12  <br/>&#61568; NOM% 8.594631 <br/>24 N 24 <br/>822.06 +/&#61473; PMT &#61473;822.06 <br/>108904.49 +/&#61473; FV &#61473;108,904.49 <br/>PV 109,829.017089 (market value of the mortgage) <br/>+ 25000 = 134,829.017089 (market value of the offer) <br/></p>

<p>Question 632 <br/>Answer: 4  <br/>Option (4) is correct because the accelerated biweekly payment is calculated as the monthly payment divided in <br/>half; instead of paying once a month, one-half of the monthly payment is paid every two weeks. Since the effect <br/>of the accelerated biweekly payments allows the borrower to make the equivalent of one extra monthly <br/>payment, the borrower will pay less interest over the loan and make a larger number of payments in a calendar <br/>year than with a constant monthly repayment schedule. Option (1) is incorrect because the borrower will make <br/>more monthly payments in a calendar year than a borrower who makes constant monthly payments. Option (2) <br/>is incorrect because the borrower will pay less interest over the life of the loan than a borrower who makes <br/>constant monthly payments. Option (3) is incorrect because the borrower pays one-half of the monthly <br/>payment every two weeks. This amounts to one-twenty-fourth of the annual payment, since one-twelfth of the <br/>annual payment is equivalent to the monthly payment.  <br/></p>
<p>Question 633 <br/>Answer: 2 <br/>Option (2) is correct because when estimating gross potential rents, the appraiser should have a sound <br/>knowledge of the current market rents for various types of accommodation, as gross potential rent is estimated <br/>using the market rents for recently leased similar space. Options (1), (3), and (4) are therefore incorrect. <br/></p>
<p>Question 634 <br/>Answer: 4 <br/>To find the market value of the subject property, determine the NOI for the subject property using the <br/>comparable information given.  <br/> <br/></p>
<p>Cap Rate = 6% <br/>So what is the NOI? <br/> <br/>The long-term vacancy rate is equal to 4%. <br/> <br/></p>
<p>NOI = $430,000 &#61473; (0.04 &#215; $430,000) &#61473; $130,000 = $282,800  <br/> <br/></p>
<p>Sale Price = NOI &#247; Market Yield  <br/> <br/>Sale Price = $282,800 &#247; 0.06 = $4,713,333 <br/> <br/>Market Value = $4,713,333 &#61473; $65,000 = $4,648,333, rounded to $4,648,000. <br/></p>
<p>Question 635 <br/>Answer: 3 <br/>Option (3) is correct because public relations refers to communications (other than personal selling and <br/>advertising) for the purpose of enhancing the image, recognition, and reputation of the firm. These <br/>communications can be with employees, stockholders, clients, and the general public. Option (1) is incorrect <br/>because sales promotion refers to any form of non-personal selling that does not fall under the head of public <br/>relations, advertising, or publicity. Option (2) is incorrect because undifferentiated marketing is a practice of <br/>marketing a product or service, not enhancing the general image and reputation of a business. Option (4) is <br/>incorrect because target theory is concerned with which group(s) a business focuses their marketing efforts on, <br/>and does not directly involve enhancing the general image and reputation of the business. </p>


<p>Question 636 <br/>Answer: 4 <br/>Option (4) is correct the Superintendent of Real Estate is appointed by the BC Financial Services Authority <br/>board of directors. Options (1), (2), and (3) are incorrect for that reason. <br/></p>
<p>Question 637 <br/>Answer: 4 <br/>Option (4) is correct because, although the definition of a residential complex includes most dwelling-units, a <br/>home which is used for short-term rentals would likely be considered a dwelling unit akin to a hotel, and thus <br/>would be excluded from the definition of a residential complex under the Excise Tax Act. Option (1) is incorrect <br/>because the residential complex definition includes land that is reasonably necessary for the use and <br/>enjoyment of the complex as a place of residence. Options (2) and (3) are incorrect because the definition of <br/>residential complex includes detached homes and condominiums used as dwelling houses which do not fall <br/>under the &#8220;hotel&#8221; exception. <br/></p>
<p>Question 638 <br/>Answer: 2 <br/>Option (2) is correct because, in order to subdivide his lot and build two condominium projects, Bard will need <br/>the municipal council or regional district to pass a new bylaw amending the current zoning bylaw. To pass a <br/>bylaw changing the permitted use or density of the zone, a public hearing must be held to give persons whose <br/>interest in property would be affected an opportunity to be heard. Option (1) is incorrect because a legal <br/>non-conforming use refers to land use that is impermissible under current zoning restrictions, but which is <br/>nevertheless lawful because the use existed lawfully before the restrictions took effect. One cannot apply for a <br/>legal non-conforming use exemption for the purposes of converting a property to a use currently prohibited by <br/>an existing bylaw. Option (3) is incorrect because, in order to further change the use or density of a zone, the <br/>municipal council must hold another public hearing. Option (4) is incorrect because Options (1) and (3) are <br/>incorrect. <br/></p>
<p>Question 639 <br/>Answer: 4 <br/>Option (4) is correct because a garnishing order may only be obtained either during or after a lawsuit <br/>(depending on the circumstances), but never before the lawsuit has been brought before a judge. Option (1) is <br/>incorrect because a notice of civil claim outlines the details of a plaintiff&#8217;s claim, and is served to the defendant <br/>before the claim is actually brought before a judge. Option (2) is incorrect because a response to civil claim is <br/>the defendant&#8217;s initial written reply to the notice of civil claim, and it is also filed and served before the claim is <br/>brought before a judge. Option (3) is incorrect because discovery proceedings are a means for bringing out the <br/>relevant evidence before the case gets to trial. <br/></p>
<p>Question 640 <br/>Answer: 1 <br/>Option (1) is correct because with an interest accruing loan, the lender receives no payments before the <br/>maturity of the loan. This means that the entire loan amount and the interest accrued is at risk throughout the <br/>entire term of the loan, making it the most risky of the four types of loans in this question, all other things being <br/>equal. Option (2) is incorrect because an interest only loan is less risky because the borrower contracts to make <br/>regular payments of the interest earned to the lender throughout the term of the loan. Options (3) and (4) are <br/>incorrect because, with both of these loans, the lender receives periodic payments of both the principal amount <br/>and interest throughout the term of the loan.  </p>


<p>Question 641 <br/>Answer: 1  <br/>Option (1) is correct because property taxes are paid on July 1, therefore, they have been paid by the seller. <br/>When property taxes have been paid by the seller, the buyer should reimburse the seller for that portion of the <br/>year from and including the adjustment date. The tax adjustment will appear as a credit on the seller&#8217;s <br/>statement and a debit on the buyer&#8217;s statement. Options (2), (3), and (4) are therefore incorrect. <br/></p>
<p>Question 642 <br/>Answer: 3 <br/>Option (3) is correct because the British Columbia Real Estate Services Act does not require licensees to disclose <br/>any other properties that they are considering. Options (1), (2), and (4) are incorrect because section 53 of the <br/>Real Estate Services Rules requires licensees who are selling or purchasing real estate on their own behalf to <br/>make a written disclosure of their personal interest in the transaction to the other party. <br/></p>
<p>Question 643 <br/>Answer: 4 <br/>Option (4) is correct because there is no financial statement called a corporate statement of holdings. Options <br/>(1), (2), and (3) are incorrect because they are commonly used financial statements. <br/></p>
<p>Question 644 <br/>Answer: 3 <br/>Option (3) is correct because amperage is defined as a measure of electrical flow. Option (1) is incorrect because <br/>voltage is defined as a measure of electrical potential. Options (2) and (4) are incorrect because wattage is <br/>defined as a measure of electrical consumption or power. <br/></p>

<p>Question 646 <br/>Answer: 1 <br/>Option (1) is correct because when real estate prices are increasing very quickly, they are reflecting the <br/>increasing market values of properties. The selling price would therefore likely be lower than the actual market <br/>value in a time of rapidly increasing real estate prices. Options (2) is incorrect because if a seller is not in a hurry <br/>to sell, he or she is likely to wait to obtain the highest possible price. Option (3) is incorrect because a buyer who <br/>is in a hurry to buy may pay a premium to acquire a property. Option (4) is incorrect because a property that has <br/>been exposed to the market for more than two months does not necessarily indicate that the sale price will be lower <br/>than the market value, as the market could fluctuate in many ways throughout the two months. </p>


<p>Question 647 <br/>Answer: 2 <br/>To find the nominal interest rate with semi-annual compounding, calculate the payment based on the face <br/>value of the loan of $217,200.

<p>Question 649 <br/>Answer: 2 <br/>Option (2) is correct because a property that is not at its highest and best use has redevelopment potential, <br/>which is recognized as latent value. Options (1), (3), and (4) are incorrect. </p>


<p>Question 650 <br/>Answer: 1  <br/>Max loan = Lending value &#215; Loan-to-value ratio <br/>Max loan = $363,000 &#215; 0.80  <br/>Max loan = $290,400  <br/> <br/>This is the amount of their mortgage. <br/> <br/>The question asks for the down payment. If the purchase price is $365,000, and the mortgage is $290,400, then <br/>the down payment is equal to the difference of $74,600 ($365,000 &#61473; $290,400). <br/></p>
<p>Question 651 <br/>Answer: 4 <br/>Option (4) is correct because voltage is a measure of electrical potential, not power or consumption. Options (1), <br/>(2), and (3) are true statements. <br/></p>
<p>Question 652 <br/>Answer: 2  <br/>Option (2) is correct because lenders are more interested in the income generated from the commercial <br/>property than the borrower&#8217;s personal income. Options (1), (3), and (4) are incorrect because they do not <br/>describe differences between underwriting income-producing properties and residential borrower <br/>qualification.  <br/></p>
<p>Question 653 <br/>Answer: 4 <br/>Option (4) is correct because a board of variance must be established by every local government that has <br/>adopted a zoning bylaw to ensure that the bylaw does not cause undue hardship. A board of variance may <br/>grant minor variances from zoning bylaws where compliance would cause undue hardship provided that the <br/>variance would not conflict with the policies of the local government. Option (1) is incorrect because boards of <br/>variance do not enforce municipality compliance with the Local Government Act. Option (2) is incorrect <br/>because boards of variance do not settle boundary line disputes between private parties. Option (3) is incorrect <br/>because legal non-conforming uses may be permitted to exist for more than six months. <br/></p>
<p>Question 654 <br/>Answer: 4 <br/>Option (4) is correct because accounts payable is a liability, since it represents a debt owed. Option (1) is <br/>incorrect because accumulated depreciation will fall under the asset category of the balance sheet, and will take <br/>away from the value of the depreciable asset(s). Options (2) and (3) are incorrect because inventory and rent <br/>receivable are both current assets. <br/></p>
<p>Question 655 <br/>Answer: 4 <br/>Option (4) is correct because the Residential Tenancy Regulation limits annual rent increases to an amount <br/>equal to the Consumer Price Index (CPI) for British Columbia (in this case, 3%). Since this rent increase exceeds <br/>this amount, it will only be valid if approved for special circumstances as set out in the Residential Tenancy <br/>Regulation. Option (1) is incorrect because written notice of a rent increase need only be given to a tenant at <br/>least three months before it becomes effective. Option (2) is incorrect because the landlord may apply for <br/>approval for this rent increase based on special circumstances. Option (3) is incorrect because a new landlord is <br/>not given the right to raise the rent above the set amount (the applicable CPI). </p>


<p>Question 656 <br/>Answer: 4 <br/>Option (4) is the correct answer because the legal rights of ownership and the physical property will determine <br/>the value of a property. The listing price, Option (3), may represent the value to owner, but does not determine <br/>the actual value that the property is worth in the market. Option (1) is incorrect because vendor financing may <br/>impact the value, but is not a key determinant of value. Option (2) is incorrect because cash-equivalent price <br/>represents the market value of a property only if non-market financing was involved in a sale/purchase. <br/></p>
<p>Question 657 <br/>Answer: 3 <br/>Option (3) is correct because a principal can retroactively ratify a contract which was entered into by his agent <br/>without the necessary authority. Ratification expresses the principal&#8217;s consent to be bound just as if the agent <br/>had been authorized to make the contract in the first place. Option (1) is incorrect because, if the principal <br/>ratifies the contract, the contract is valid and the third party is obligated to honour the contract. Option (2) is <br/>incorrect because a warranty of authority is an agent&#8217;s promise to third parties (not the principal) that his or her <br/>actions fall within the scope of authority given by the principal. Therefore, only third parties to whom the <br/>warranty of authority is made can sue the agent for breaching the warranty. Option (4) is incorrect because, <br/>where a principal adopts a contract which his agent entered into without any authority, the principal (not the <br/>agent) becomes a party to that contract. <br/></p>
<p>Question 658 <br/>Answer: 2 <br/>Option (2) is correct because, in a joint tenancy, co-owners are viewed as a single legal owner against everyone <br/>else; and therefore, each owns an undivided interest in the whole of the estate. Option (1) is incorrect because <br/>individuals can enter into a joint tenancy regardless of their respective financial contributions to the purchase <br/>of the property. Option (3) is incorrect because more than two individuals can enter into a single joint tenancy <br/>and because individuals do not have to be married to enter into a joint tenancy. Option (4) is incorrect because <br/>each of the following four common law &#8220;unities&#8221; can be satisfied: (1) all joint tenants must receive their interests <br/>at the same time; (2) all joint tenants must receive their interest from the same document; (3) all joint tenants <br/>must have the same interest in the land; and (4) all joint tenants must be entitled to possession of the whole <br/>estate. <br/></p>
<p>Question 659 <br/>Answer: 3 <br/>Option (3) is correct because any verification of dated communication helps to give credibility to a statement or <br/>allegation. However, verifying the authenticity of electronic documents and email communications is difficult. <br/>Further, electronic communication may not stand alone as evidence if there is a question as to the authenticity <br/>or origin of the communication. Therefore, keeping hard copies is extremely important from a legal <br/>perspective. Options (1), (2), and (4) are incorrect for the same reasons. <br/></p>
<p>Question 660 <br/>Answer: 2 <br/>Option (2) is correct because marketable securities, accounts receivable, inventories, and prepaid expenses is <br/>the correct listing of assets from most to least liquid. Option (1) is incorrect because marketable securities are <br/>more liquid than accounts receivable, and accounts payable is not an asset. Option (3) is incorrect because <br/>marketable securities are more liquid than accounts receivable, and land is the least liquid asset listed. Option <br/>(4) is incorrect because inventory is generally more liquid than prepaid expenses, and the building is the least <br/>liquid asset listed. </p>


<p>Question 661 <br/>Answer: 1 <br/>Option (1) is correct because section 4 of the Real Estate Services Act stipulates that if an agent is unlicensed at <br/>the time real estate services were provided, he or she cannot bring a court action to collect commission. Options <br/>(2) and (3) are incorrect for the same reason. Option (4) is incorrect because there is no indication, based on the <br/>facts presented in this situation, that the listing contract violates the statutory requirements of the Real Estate <br/>Services Act. <br/></p>
<p>Question 662 <br/>Answer: 3 <br/>Option (3) is correct because, under section 47(1)(a) of the Residential Tenancy Act, a landlord may give a <br/>tenant a notice of the end of a tenancy if the tenant does not pay the security deposit within 30 days of the date <br/>it is required to be paid under the agreement. Option (1) is incorrect because, as per section 47(1)(c) of the <br/>Residential Tenancy Act, a landlord may only give a tenant notice of the end of a tenancy for reasons relating to <br/>the number of occupants if there are an &#8220;unreasonable&#8221; number of occupants in the rental unit. Two occupants <br/>in a one-bedroom apartment would not be considered unreasonable, and therefore, a landlord could not end a <br/>tenancy for this reason. Option (2) is incorrect because Jordan cannot end the tenancy early in order to renovate <br/>the warehouse. Jordan must wait until the lease term expires. Option (4) is incorrect because MacGregor must <br/>give the tenant at least 2 months&#8217; notice in order to end Mrs. Julian&#8217;s tenancy to allow his son to move into the <br/>apartment. <br/></p>
<p>Question 663 <br/>Answer: 3 <br/>Option (3) is correct (false) because there are several organizations that offer mortgage loan insurance such as <br/>CMHC, Genworth Financial Canada, and the Canada Guaranty Mortgage Insurance Company. Options (1), (2), <br/>and (4) are incorrect because they are true statements. <br/></p>
<p>Question 664 <br/>Answer: 3 <br/>Option (1) is incorrect because landowners in British Columbia now own or have rights in the airspace above <br/>their property only to the extent that they can make effective use of it (not insofar as the owner can see). Option <br/>(2) is incorrect because the Government of British Columbia has reserved subsurface rights to gold and silver in <br/>favour of the Crown since the time when original Crown grants were made in the 19th century. Option (4) is <br/>incorrect because subsurface rights to petroleum have also been reserved in favour of the Crown since 1899; <br/>therefore, only landowners whose property was granted by the Crown prior to this date might have ownership <br/>of subsurface petroleum (depending on the terms of the original grant). <br/></p>
<p>Question 665 <br/>Answer: 1 <br/>Option (1) is correct because an owner developer must file a strata plan in order to create a strata development. <br/>The strata plan divides the entirely of the building between strata lots and common property. Option (2) is <br/>incorrect because cooperative developments are not strata developments, and therefore have no corresponding <br/>strata plans. Option (3) is incorrect because strata plans are required for all strata developments. Option (4) is <br/>incorrect because restrictive covenants impose restrictions on the use of one person&#8217;s land for the benefit of <br/>another piece of land. A strata plan does not impose restrictions on &#8220;burdened&#8221; land for the benefit of some <br/>other &#8220;benefitted&#8221; land.  <br/> <br/>[NOTE: This question has been replaced.<b><i> </i></b><i></i>Please review your Bulletins posted on your Course Resources <br/>webpage.] </p>


<p>Question 666 <br/>Answer: 1 <br/>Option (1) is correct because a credit analysis evaluates an applicant&#8217;s ability to meet the terms of a mortgage <br/>and the amount of his or her available for future mortgage payments. Options (2), (3), and (4) are incorrect as <br/>they do not describe the primary purpose of a credit analysis of a mortgagor. <br/></p>
<p>Question 667  <br/>Answer: 2 <br/>Option (2) is correct because under section 55 of the Real Estate Services Rules, a licensee must provide a <br/>consumer with a Disclosure of Risks to Unrepresented Parties form when the licensee makes a disclosure under <br/>section 54 to an unrepresented party AND the licensee is also representing a client in the same trade in real <br/>estate. Options (1), (3), and (4) are incorrect because licensees are not required to make this disclosure to an <br/>unrepresented party if the licensee is not also representing a client in the same trade. <br/></p>
<p>Question 668 <br/>Answer: 4 <br/>Option (4) is correct because a borrower may be unable to make the mortgage payments due to a number of <br/>reasons including loss of employment. Option (1) is incorrect because when this occurs, the lender can, but may <br/>choose not to, take immediate legal action against the borrower. Options (2) and (3) are incorrect because <br/>sometimes it is in the best interest of the lender to grant extra time for the borrower to repay the deficit, but the <br/>borrower cannot automatically adjust the payment terms.  <br/></p>
<p>Question 669 <br/>Answer: 4 <br/>Option (4) is correct because general price indices, such as the consumer price index or the shelter price index, <br/>are irrelevant to the appraisal of one particular property since changes in the value of consumer products are <br/>not necessarily the same as changes in the value of property. Therefore, Options (1), (2), and (3) are incorrect. <br/></p>
<p>Question 670 <br/>Answer: 3 <br/>Option (3) is correct because appraisers cannot use sale prices for houses recently sold between related parties <br/>for comparison purposes. Market value is determined by analyzing market transactions where the buyer and <br/>seller have no special relationship (i.e., the sale occurred at arm&#8217;s length) and the properties sold are similar (or <br/>comparable) to the subject property. Options (1), (2), and (4) are incorrect because with appropriate adjustment, <br/>the sale prices of all of these properties can be used for comparison purposes. <br/></p>
<p>Question 671 <br/>Answer: 1 <br/> Replacement cost of house: $42.50 &#215; 2,600 = $110,500 <br/>Land: $41,500 <br/>Land + House = $152,000 <br/>minus depreciation ($16,300) = $135,700 <br/>minus bathroom kitchen fixtures ($13,200) = $122,500 <br/> <br/>The market value is $122,500. </p>


<p>Question 672 <br/>Answer: 1 <br/>Option (1) is correct because in relation to the subject property, this comparable has one less bedroom and no <br/>alarm system. Options (2), (3), and (4) are therefore incorrect. <br/></p>
<p>Question 673 <br/>Answer: 4 <br/>To solve this question, calculate the maximum amount of money that can be lent out given the two constraints: <br/>the loan-to-value amount and the gross debt service ratio amount. Calculate the loan amount for the <br/>loan-to-value constraint and then calculate the loan amount for the GDSR constraint. In order to determine the <br/>maximum amount that the lender will advance, choose the lesser of the two results.  <br/> <br/>LTV = 80%  <br/></p>
<p> <br/>Lending Value = $238,000  <br/>Maximum loan under lender&#8217;s LTV criteria = 0.8 &#215; $238,000 = $190,400  <br/> <br/></p>
<p>GDSR = 30%  <br/> <br/></p>
<p>P I T P I $1,750GDSR 0.30<br/>GI $65,000<br/>+ + + +<br/></p>
<p>= &#8594; =   <br/></p>
<p>P+I = (GDSR &#215; GI) &#8211; T  <br/>P+I = (0.3 &#215; $65,000) &#8211; $1,750  <br/>P+I = $17,750 (annual mortgage payment)  <br/></p>
<p> <br/>The loan states that monthly payments are required so:  <br/> <br/></p>
<p>P+I = $17,750 &#247; 12 = $1,479.17 (monthly mortgage payment)  <br/> <br/>The next step is to calculate the maximum loan amount given the contract terms and the monthly payment. <br/> <br/>Press Display <br/>6.5 &#61568; NOM%  6.5 <br/>1 &#61568; P/YR 1 <br/>&#61568; EFF% 6.5 <br/>12 &#61568; P/YR 12 <br/>&#61568; NOM%  6.314033 <br/>1479.17 +/&#61473; PMT &#61473;1,479.17 <br/>240 N 240 <br/>0 FV 0 <br/>PV  201,339.320187 <br/> <br/>The maximum loan under the GDSR is $201,300, rounded to the nearest $100. <br/> <br/>The maximum loan amount is the lower of the two constraints: $190,400 &lt; $201,300; therefore, $190,400 is the <br/>maximum amount this lender will advance.  </p>


<p>Question 674 <br/>Answer: 3 <br/>Option (3) is false. Mortgages require a high degree of administrative work such as writing contracts, registering <br/>the mortgage charge, and subsequent administration of outstanding balance and refinancing. Options (1), (2), <br/>and (4) are incorrect because they are characteristics of a mortgage as an investment. <br/></p>
<p>Question 675 <br/>Answer: 1  <br/>Option (1) is correct because, at common law, a life tenant is generally under no obligation to repair or <br/>compensate for waste that occurs as a result of allowing the property to deteriorate without any positive acts <br/>(permissive waste). Option (2) is incorrect because life tenants are liable to the remainderman for direct, <br/>positive acts that result in damage to the property beyond the use to which the life tenant is entitled (voluntary <br/>waste). Option (3) is incorrect because a life tenant is liable for direct, positive acts which improve rather than <br/>destroy the property (ameliorating waste) &#8211; but, usually no damages can be awarded, as the property has been <br/>improved. Option (4) is incorrect because a life tenant is liable for waste that he or she causes by flagrantly or <br/>maliciously damaging or destroying the property (equitable waste). <br/></p>
<p>Question 676 <br/>Answer: 4 <br/>Option (4) is correct because depreciation expense is used to allocate the cost of a depreciable asset over the <br/>course of its life. Option (1) is incorrect because depreciation expense is an accounting framework, whereas <br/>capital cost allowance is a taxation framework. Option (2) is incorrect because depreciation expense cannot be <br/>deducted from taxable income, whereas capital cost allowance can be. Option (3) is incorrect because land is <br/>not a depreciable asset. <br/></p>
<p>Question 677 <br/>Answer: 4 <br/>Option (4) is correct because real property ownership in British Columbia is based on English common law <br/>property rights as modified by legislation such as the Property Law Act and the Land Title Act. Option (1) is <br/>incorrect because an owner of an interest in real property in British Columbia may have a number of interests <br/>that fall short of a fee simple interest (e.g., life estate, estate pur autre vie, leasehold, etc.). Option (2) is incorrect <br/>because the extent of the usage rights enjoyed by an owner of an interest in real property depends heavily upon <br/>the type of interest that the owner holds. Additionally, even an owner of real property in fee simple must still <br/>abide by various common law restrictions as well as legislative restrictions (e.g., municipalities have the power <br/>to regulate subdivision). Option (3) is incorrect because an owner of an interest in real property in British <br/>Columbia can have an interest less than a 99-year lease from the Crown (e.g., a lease for a term of less than 99 <br/>years). </p>


<p>Question 678 <br/>Answer: 2 <br/>Find the amount of principal that has been paid off during the 2-year term.  <br/> <br/>Press Display  <br/>9.75 &#61568; NOM%  9.75 <br/>2 &#61568; P/YR  2 <br/>&#61568; EFF%  9.987656 <br/>12 &#61568; P/YR  12 <br/>&#61568; NOM% 9.557657 <br/>1500000 PV 1,500,000 <br/>20 &#215; 12 = N  240 <br/>0 FV 0 <br/>PMT &#61473;14,038.492319 <br/>14038.49 +/&#61473; PMT &#61473;14,038.49 <br/>1 INPUT 24 &#61568; AMORT PER 1-24  <br/>=  &#61473;55,071.663913 <br/> <br/>The amount of principal paid off during the 2-year term is $55,072, rounded to the nearest dollar. <br/></p>
<p>Question 679 <br/>Answer: 2 <br/>Comparable A  <br/></p>
<p>Net Operating Income: $36,000 &#8211; $25,000 &#8211; (0.05 &#215; $36,000) = $9,200 <br/>Cap Rate: $9,200 &#247; $190,000 = 0.0484211 <br/></p>

<p> <br/>The cap rate used to calculate the market value of the subject property is the one that most reflects the subject <br/>property and is determined by several factors. For the purposes of this question, the two most comparable <br/>properties have been selected and a range of values is determined.  <br/> <br/>Subject Property <br/></p>

<p>Question 680 <br/>Answer: 4 <br/>Option (4) is correct because each of the scenarios laid out in Options (1), (2), and (3) would terminate the <br/>agency authority. Option (1) is incorrect because the doctrine of frustration appears to apply to the agency <br/>relationship, meaning that if a house listed for sale burns down, the agency would probably be terminated. <br/>Option (2) is incorrect because, the moment the principal sells his or her property, he or she terminates the <br/>authority of all listing brokers, no matter what kind of listing agreement they have. The principal may, <br/>however, still be liable to pay commission. Option (3) is incorrect because either party to an agency agreement <br/>can terminate the authority (orally or by conduct) at will.  <br/></p>
<p>Question 681 <br/>Answer: 2 <br/>Press Display <br/>6 I/YR 6 <br/>1 &#61568; P/YR 1 <br/>3500 PV 3,500 <br/>1.5 N 1.5 <br/>0 PMT 0 0 <br/>FV &#61473;3,819.678782 <br/> <br/>The future value of the deposit at an effective annual rate of 6% is $3,819.68. Since the buyer paid the deposit to <br/>the seller directly, it reduces the amount of cash that the seller will receive on closing. Therefore, the $3,819.68 <br/>will appear as a debit on the seller&#8217;s statement of adjustments. <br/></p>
<p>Question 682 <br/>Answer: 4 <br/>Option (4) is correct because none of the previous statements is true. Option (1) is incorrect because the buyer is <br/>not privy to the listing contract, meaning that the buyer owes no rights and has no obligations under the listing <br/>contract. Option (2) is incorrect because Clause 1A of the standard form listing agreement created by the British <br/>Columbia Real Estate Association requires an &#8220;Effective Date&#8221; and an &#8220;Expiry Date&#8221;. Option (3) is incorrect <br/>because an open listing provides less protection for the agent than an exclusive listing. This is because, as <br/>opposed to an exclusive listing, an open listing does not prevent the seller from employing a number of other <br/>brokerages to represent the seller. Commission is only paid to the brokerage who is the effective cause of the <br/>eventual sale. <br/></p>
<p>Question 683 <br/>Answer: 1 <br/>Option (1) is correct because the general rule is that an illiterate person is bound by a contract that he or she has <br/>agreed to, unless he or she did not know the general nature of the contract. Therefore, the illiteracy of the <br/>offeree, alone, is insufficient to release an offer. Option (2) is incorrect because an offer expires if it is not <br/>accepted within the time limit specified in the offer. Option (3) is incorrect because a counter-offer constitutes a <br/>rejection of the original offer. Option (4) is incorrect because the offeror can revoke an offer at any time <br/>provided that the offeror communicates the revocation to the offeree prior to acceptance. <br/></p>
<p>Question 684 <br/>Answer: 2 <br/>Option (2) is correct because a central gas fired, forced hot water heating system produces steady and consistent <br/>heat. Option (1) is incorrect as this type of heating system does not provide air circulation or filtration. Option <br/>(3) is incorrect as this type of heating system must be kept circulating in cold weather otherwise water will <br/>freeze and the piping will crack. Option (4) is false because this type of heating system transmits heat through <br/>convection and radiation. </p>


<p>Question 685 <br/>Answer: 1 <br/>Option (1) is correct because the Land Title Act is a body of law written and passed by the provincial <br/>government of British Columbia. Option (2) is incorrect because specific performance is a remedy that was <br/>developed by the courts of equity, not enacted via government statute. Option (3) is incorrect because the equity <br/>of redemption is a doctrine that was developed by the courts of equity, not enacted via government statue. <br/>Option (4) is incorrect because Options (2) and (3) are incorrect.  <br/></p>
<p>Question 686 <br/>Answer: 3 <br/>Option (3) is correct because there is a fundamental principle of mortgage law which prohibits &#8220;clogging&#8221; on <br/>&#8220;the equity of redemption&#8221;. This principle states that the borrower (or the mortgagor) cannot be prevented by <br/>the terms of the mortgage from eventually redeeming his or her property free from the conditions contained in <br/>the mortgage upon repayment of the loan. An option to purchase a mortgaged property given by the borrower <br/>to the lender at the time the mortgage is negotiated, if exercised, would prevent the mortgagor from redeeming <br/>his or her property upon repayment, and is therefore void. Option (1) is incorrect because, in mortgage <br/>agreements, mortgagors generally covenant to pay all taxes on land and the improvements. Option (2) is <br/>incorrect because it is common for a mortgagor to covenant to keep the land and buildings thereof in &#8220;good <br/>condition and repair&#8221;, thereby protecting the value of the security (the property). Option (4) is incorrect because <br/>the repayment clause of a mortgage agreement will set out the borrower&#8217;s promise to pay the debt and accrued <br/>interest according to the schedule agreed upon. <br/></p>
<p>Question 687 <br/>Answer: 4 <br/>Option (4) is correct because it is true. Option (1) is incorrect because given that the net operating income <br/>remains constant, the market value of the property will decline as the required yield rises. Option (2) is <br/>incorrect because the market value of an income-producing property is best determined by the yields that <br/>prospective purchasers reasonably expect to earn. Option (3) is incorrect because net operating income and <br/>gross realized income (also known as &#8220;gross realized revenue&#8221; or &#8220;gross effective income&#8221;) are different; net <br/>operating income is derived by subtracting operating expenses from gross realized income. <br/></p>
<p>Question 688 <br/>Answer: 3 <br/>Option (3) is correct because Robert expressly granted Whitney the authority to purchase the deceased&#8217;s <br/>&#8220;paisley motif&#8221; Rolls Royce by instructing Whitney not to come away from the auction without buying the <br/>automobile under any circumstances. These instructions also granted Whitney the implied authority to <br/>purchase the second &#8220;pin-striped&#8221; automobile since purchasing the second automobile was necessary in order <br/>to carry out the express instructions (to purchase the &#8220;paisley motif&#8221; automobile). Option (4) is incorrect for this <br/>reason. Options (1) and (2) are incorrect because they do not describe the full scope of Whitney&#8217;s authority.  <br/></p>
<p>Question 689 <br/>Answer: 4 <br/>Option (4) is correct because the &#8220;objective/task&#8221; method of creating a promotional budget requires that the <br/>licensee first determine the objectives of the advertisement, and then determine the desired tasks and activities <br/>necessary to reach the objective. This involves defining a &#8220;SMART&#8221; marketing objective, outlining the tasks <br/>required to attain the objective, and estimating the cost of performing these tasks. Option (1) is incorrect <br/>because this approach describes the &#8220;follow-the-competition&#8221; method. Option (2) is incorrect because this <br/>approach describes the &#8220;SMART&#8221; criteria for developing effective business and marketing goals. Option (3) is <br/>incorrect because it fails to discuss the step of defining a &#8220;SMART&#8221; marketing objective. </p>

<p>Question 691 <br/>Answer: 4 <br/>Option (4) is correct because the MLS&#174; serves many functions, including computing listing searches, producing <br/>automated hot sheets, and generating Comparative Market Analysis (CMA) presentations and other client <br/>prospecting tools. Options (1), (2), and (3) are incorrect because none of these statements correctly describes a <br/>primary function of the MLS&#174;.  <br/></p>
<p>Question 692 <br/>Answer: 4 <br/>This question requires you to compare the effective annual interest rates of Options (1), (2), (3), and (4) with the <br/>effective rate of the given nominal rate:  <br/>Press Display <br/>8 &#61568; NOM%  8 <br/>2 &#61568; P/YR  2 <br/>&#61568; EFF%  8.16  <br/> <br/>Option (1) <br/>Press Display <br/>7.2 &#61568; NOM%  7.2 <br/>4 &#61568; P/YR  4 <br/>&#61568; EFF%  7.396743 <br/> <br/>Option (2)  <br/>8.5% per annum, compounded annually is equal to the effective rate. <br/></p>

<p>Question 694 <br/>Answer: 4 <br/>Option (4) is correct because it correctly describes the interest which is acquired by a buyer of strata lot. Option <br/>(1) is incorrect because it describes what is acquired by a buyer of a unit in a cooperative, not a strata lot. Option <br/>(2) is incorrect because a buyer of a strata lot does not acquire their interest as a joint tenant with all of the other <br/>strata lot owners. If this was the case, then each owner within a given strata would share an undivided interest <br/>in the entire property (including each other&#8217;s units). Option (3) is incorrect because if the common property was <br/>shared via a joint tenancy agreement, then each owner would share a single undivided interest, and ownership <br/>could not be allocated in proportion to the unit entitlement. <br/></p>

<p><b>Seller&#8217;s Statement of Adjustments <br/>ITEM DEBIT CREDIT <br/></b>Purchase Price  155,000.00 <br/>Assumption of 1st Mortgage 71,000.00  <br/>Unpaid and Overdue Taxes + Penalty 1,200.00  <br/>Buyer's Share of Taxes*  <b>369.00</b> <br/>Commission 9,300.00  <br/>Cash Proceeds of Sale** <b> 73,869.00 </b> _________ <br/> 155,369.00 155,369.00 <br/>* (Aug. 31-Dec. 31 = 123 days) 123/365 &#61512; $1,095 = $369 <br/>** Because the total Debits and Credits must balance, in order to find the Proceeds of Sale, you must first calculate the total Credits <br/></p>
<p>($155,369.00) and then subtract the known Debits. The result is the balance of cash that the seller can expect to receive after all <br/>outstanding expenses relating to the property have been paid. </p>


<p>Question 697 <br/>Answer: 4 <br/> <b>Buyer&#8217;s Statement of Adjustments</b> <br/><b>ITEM DEBIT CREDIT <br/></b>Purchase Price 155,000.00  <br/>Deposit  5,000.00 <br/>1st Mortgage  71,000.00 <br/>2nd Mortgage  34,000.00 <br/> Buyer's Share of Taxes* <b>369.00</b>  <br/>Conveyancing Fees 600.00  <br/>Property Transfer Tax 1,550.00  <br/>Balance Due to Complete** _________ <b> 47,519.00</b> <br/> 157,519.00 157,519.00 <br/>* (Aug. 31-Dec. 31 = 123 days) 123/365 &#61512; $1,095 = $369 <br/>** Because the total Debits and Credits must balance, in order to find the Balance Due to Complete, you must first calculate the total <br/> Debits ($157,519.00) and then subtract the known Credits. The result is the balance due from the buyer to complete the <br/>transaction. <br/></p>
<p>Question 698 <br/>Answer: 4 <br/>Option (4) is correct because credit unions are considered to be institutional lenders that finance their <br/>investment by accepting deposits from their members. Private lenders are different from institutional lenders <br/>because private lenders typically do not fund their investment by receiving deposits from individuals. Options <br/>(1), (2), and (3) are incorrect because they are all examples of private lenders. <br/></p>
<p>Question 699 <br/>Answer: 2 <br/>Option (2) is correct because, where no time limit is specified, an offer will lapse after a reasonable time has <br/>passed. Courts will determine what constitutes a &#8220;reasonable&#8221; time for acceptance based on the nature of the <br/>offer or the nature of what is being sold. Options (1) and (3) are incorrect because there is no set expiration time <br/>for offers where no time period is stipulated. Option (4) is incorrect because offers can expire without being <br/>revoked by the offeror. <br/></p>
<p>Question 700 <br/>Answer: 2 <br/>Option (2) is correct because curable functional depreciation refers to an outdated feature that can be corrected <br/>economically, such as outdated bathroom fixtures. Options (1), (3), and (4) are incorrect for this reason. </p>


<p>Question 701 <br/>Answer: 2 <br/>Option (2) is correct because an individual who purchases property, pays the Foreign Buyers&#8217; Tax, and within a <br/>year becomes a permanent resident or citizen of Canada, is eligible to claim back the Foreign Buyers&#8217; Tax that <br/>he or she paid. Option (1) is incorrect because the tax applies to foreign nationals who are not Canadian citizens <br/>or permanent residents of Canada. Option (3) is incorrect because the foreign buyer&#8217;s tax applies to foreign <br/>corporations. Although the company was incorporated in Canada, it is controlled by a foreign corporation, are <br/>therefore would be considered a foreign corporation for the purpose of the tax. Option (4) is incorrect because a <br/>Canadian citizen who holds title for a foreign national is considered to be a taxable trustee, and is therefore <br/>subject to the tax.  <br/></p>
<p>Question 702 <br/>Answer: 2 <br/>The market value of Mary&#8217;s offer is the market value of the mortgage plus her cash down payment. Mary will <br/>assume the remaining 24 monthly payments of $1,500.05 and the outstanding balance of $214,838.44. <br/>Calculate the market value of the mortgage by determining the PV of the payments and OSB remaining at the <br/>end of the original 5-year term based on the current market rate of j2 = 8%. <br/>Press Display <br/>8 &#9632;  NOM% 8 <br/>2 &#9632;  P/YR  2 <br/>&#9632;  EFF% 8.16 <br/>12 &#9632;  P/YR 12  <br/>&#9632;  NOM% 7.869836 <br/>24 N 24 <br/>1500.05 +/&#61473; PMT &#61473;1,500.05 <br/>214838.44 +/&#61473; FV &#61473;214,838.44 <br/>PV 216,855.294924 (market value of the mortgage) <br/>+ 50000 = 266,855.294924 (market value of the offer) <br/></p>
<p>Question 703 <br/>Answer: 1 <br/>Option (1) is correct because the &#8220;better use&#8221; test states that the affixation of an object for the purpose of <br/>improving the property will be taken as evidence that the object is a fixture, not a chattel (La Salle Recreations <br/>Ltd. v. Canadian Camdex Investments Ltd.). Option (2) is incorrect because part two of the test articulated in <br/>Stack v. T. Eaton Co. states that articles affixed to the land even slightly are presumed to be part of the land, <br/>unless the circumstances show that they were intended to remain as chattels. Option (3) is incorrect because the <br/>courts have developed the Stack v. Eaton test, a two part test for determining whether an item is a fixture or a <br/>chattel. Option (4) is incorrect because the Stack v. Eaton test examines both the degree of affixation and the <br/>purpose of affixation as factors which may overturn the presumption that articles affixed to the land are <br/>fixtures.  </p>


<p>Question 704 <br/>Answer: 2 <br/>Press Display <br/>10.5 &#61568; NOM% 10.5 <br/>2 &#61568; P/YR 2 <br/>&#61568; EFF% 10.775625 <br/>12 &#61568; P/YR 12 <br/>&#61568; NOM% 10.277418 <br/>625 +/&#8211; PMT &#8211;625 <br/>300 N 300 <br/>0 FV 0 <br/>PV  67,325.219664 <br/></p>
<p>Question 705 <br/>Answer: 2 <br/>Option (2) is correct because a graduated payment mortgage has payments that increase on a regular basis over <br/>a specified term. Option (1) is incorrect because in a reverse annuity mortgage, there is no repayment until the <br/>end of the loan term or the death of the borrower; instead, over the term of the mortgage, the lender advances <br/>funds to the borrower. Option (3) is incorrect because in a straight line principal reduction mortgage, the same <br/>amount of principal is always paid and the corresponding interest is based on the outstanding balance; <br/>therefore, the monthly mortgage payments decrease. Option (4) is incorrect because in an interest accruing <br/>mortgage, no payments of interest or principal are made during the life of the loan.  <br/></p>
<p>Question 706 <br/>Answer: 4 <br/>Option (4) is correct because section 3 of the Interest Act states that if a document requires interest to be paid <br/>but the rate is not set out then the rate allowed by law is 5% per annum. Option (1) is incorrect because the <br/>Interest Act does not require that the rate of interest chargeable under a mortgage be &#8220;reasonable&#8221;, in the <br/>prevailing market for funds. The Interest Act imposes no general cap on mortgage interest rates and states that, <br/>except as otherwise provided for by an Act of Parliament, any person may charge &#8220;any rate of interest&#8230;that is <br/>agreed on&#8221;. Option (2) is incorrect because the Criminal Code defines a criminal rate of interest as an effective <br/>annual rate of over 60%, not 50%. Option (3) is incorrect because section 10 of the Interest Act does not impose a <br/>requirement that the mortgage not be for a business purpose in order for an individual to qualify for the right <br/>to prepay his or her mortgage. Section 10 applies where: (a) the borrower is an individual; and (b) the mortgage <br/>provides that it is not payable for more than five years from the date of the mortgage.  <br/></p>

<p>Question 708 <br/>Answer: 2 <br/>Option (2) is correct because a licensee may be held liable for damages caused by a negligent misstatement <br/>made to a person with whom they do not have a contractual relationship. For example, a licensee acting for a <br/>seller could be held liable for negligent misrepresentation for a statement made to a buyer despite having no <br/>contractual relationship with the buyer. Options (1) and (4) are incorrect because the special relationship giving <br/>rise to a duty to take care (not to make negligent misstatements) will be created where a skilled person, such as a <br/>real estate licensee, gives advice in the course of his or her business to a person who is reasonable going to rely <br/>on that advice. Option (3) is incorrect because a skilled person, such as a real estate licensee, can avoid liability <br/>for negligent misstatements by giving their advice or opinion with a clear qualification that he or she accepts no <br/>responsibility for the accuracy or reliability of the advice.  <br/></p>
<p>Question 709 <br/>Answer: 3 <br/>Option (3) is correct because the mutual exchange of concessions is crucial to effective negotiations. If you enter <br/>negotiations unprepared to make concessions it is unlikely that the other party will be willing to do so. Option <br/>(1) is incorrect because it is important that concessions occur in a relatively reciprocal fashion. If one party <br/>makes repeated concessions without expecting the other party to follow with similar behaviour, this <br/>encourages the latter party to hold tight and not participate in the exchange of resources. Option (2) is incorrect <br/>because considerable research demonstrates that more optimal solutions are reached when parties do not go <br/>issue by issue, and instead package and trade multiple issues simultaneously. Option (4) is incorrect because <br/>disclosing your underlying interests will often result in more effective negotiations. If you share your true <br/>interests, the other party will often reciprocate. This allows both parties to identify the true needs and desires of <br/>each other and then to find creative solutions that will satisfy those needs and desires. <br/></p>
<p>Question 710 <br/>Answer: 4 <br/>Option (4) is correct because changes to retained earnings are calculated by taking the amount of net income <br/>less any dividends paid to shareholders. RE/LAX earned a net income of $234,000 and paid $14,000 in <br/>dividends; therefore, the retained earnings account on their balance sheet should increase by $220,000. Option <br/>(1) is therefore incorrect. Options (2) and (3) are also incorrect because net income and revenue comes from the <br/>income statement rather than the balance sheet. <br/></p>
<p>Question 711 <br/>Answer: 2 <br/>Option (2) is correct because south facing windows are the most energy efficient in heating. Options (1), (3), and <br/>(4) are therefore incorrect.  <br/></p>
<p>Question 712 <br/>Answer: 2 <br/>Option (2) is correct because in terms of appraisal, &#8220;recent&#8221; refers to the time period for which supply and <br/>demand conditions have not changed or have remained relatively stable. Options (1), (3), and (4) are therefore <br/>incorrect. </p>


<p>Question 713 <br/>Answer: 4 <br/>Option (4) is correct because a caveat is a note placed on a certificate of title by a person claiming an interest in <br/>land that temporarily prevents all dealings (e.g., transfers, mortgages, etc.) with the land inconsistent with the <br/>estate or interest claimed by the caveator. Option (1) is incorrect because caveats are not issued by the <br/>Prosecutor&#8217;s Office. Option (2) is incorrect because a caveat is a temporary &#8220;freezing&#8221; measure. If a party <br/>commences a court action concerning the property, then a certificate of pending litigation can be registered <br/>against the property to provide formal notice of that court action. Option (3) is incorrect because builder&#8217;s liens <br/>are registered as charges on title, not as caveats.  <br/></p>
<p>Question 714 <br/>Answer: 4 <br/>Option (4) is correct because it is unlikely that 100% occupancy will be reached in most properties. Option (1) is <br/>incorrect because vacancy rates are expressed as a percentage of gross potential revenue. Option (2) is incorrect <br/>because vacancy rates are not considered an operating expense; they are an allowance for reductions in gross <br/>potential revenue attributable to vacancies, tenant turnover, and nonpayment of rent or other income. Option <br/>(3) is incorrect because vacancy allowance is determined by the long-term vacancy rates in the area; therefore, it <br/>does not matter if the subject property has never had any vacancies before. <br/></p>
<p>Question 715 <br/>Answer: 1 <br/>Option (1) is correct because since total assets = total liabilities on a balance sheet, if the total assets for The <br/>Mountain Bike Emporium = $185,900 and the only liabilities were accounts payable of $2,900 and long-term <br/>debt of $89,450, the amount of owner&#8217;s equity = $93,550 ($185,900 &#8211; $2,900 &#8211; $89,450). Options (2), (3), and (4) <br/>are therefore incorrect. <br/></p>
<p>Question 716 <br/>Answer: 3 <br/>Option (3) is correct because according to the cost principle, an asset must be recorded for the amount that was <br/>paid for it. Options (1), (2), and (4) are incorrect because they are true statements. <br/></p>
<p>Question 717 <br/>Answer: 3 <br/>Option (3) is correct because quantum meruit is the doctrine that no one who benefits by the labour and <br/>material of another should be unjustly enriched thereby. In the circumstances of this question, the law will <br/>invoke quantum meruit to imply a promise (given by Joe to Harry) to pay a reasonable about for the delivery of <br/>the groceries, even though a specific contract price was not agreed to. Option (1) is incorrect for the same <br/>reason. Option (2) is incorrect because the delivery of groceries does not fall within the scope of the Real Estate <br/>Services Act. Option (4) is incorrect because section 54 if the Law and Equity Act deals with waiver of conditions <br/>precedent, not payment for services. </p>


<p>Question 718 <br/>Answer: 4 <br/>Option (4) is correct because, in order to offend section 52 and section 74.01 of the Competition Act, a <br/>representation must be &#8220;false or misleading in a material respect&#8221;. Despite being strictly false, understating the <br/>square footage of a condo by merely 2 square feet would likely be insufficient to constitute a material <br/>misrepresentation. Option (1) is incorrect because misrepresenting a strata unit as having two bedrooms when <br/>it only has one would be considered false and misleading in a material respect. Option (2) is incorrect because <br/>section 52 prohibits reckless misrepresentations, and falsely advertising a house as having a recently renovated <br/>kitchen without first investigating the matter would be considered reckless. This false advertisement would also <br/>offend section 74.01, since section 74.01 imposes no requirement that the deceptive practices were made <br/>knowingly or recklessly. Option (3) is incorrect because advertising homes starting at $700,000 when the lowest <br/>priced home is, in fact, priced $300,000 higher, would be considered false and misleading in a material respect. <br/></p>
<p>Question 719 <br/>Answer: 2 <br/>Option (2) is correct because the Occupiers Liability Act imposes a duty on occupiers of premises (in this case, <br/>the owner and/or building manager) to take such care as in all the circumstances is reasonable to see that <br/>persons coming onto the property (in this case, the visitor) will be reasonably safe. In this scenario, the visitor <br/>can argue that this duty was not met because the skylight collapsed, inuring him. Option (1) is incorrect <br/>because, based on the facts provided, no untrue statement was made by the owner or the building manager to <br/>the visitor. Option (3) is incorrect because, on these facts, there is nothing that establishes a fiduciary duty owed <br/>by the owner or the building manager to the visitor (a fiduciary duty is a special type of duty imposed only in <br/>select situations). Option (4) is incorrect because the collapse of the skylight did not interfere with the visitor&#8217;s <br/>use and enjoyment of the visitor&#8217;s own property.  <br/></p>
<p>Question 720 <br/>Answer: 1 <br/>Option (1) is correct because the seller will be liable because he, as the principal: (a) is responsible for the acts of <br/>his agent and (b) expressly authorized the tort. Option (2) is incorrect because an agent can never escape <br/>liability for torts committed by the agent on the basis that the agent was authorized by the principal to commit <br/>them. Option (3) is incorrect because the inclusion of this clause in the contract of purchase and sale gives the <br/>vendor protection against innocent misrepresentations; however, it will not protect the vendor in the case of <br/>fraudulent misrepresentation. Option (4) is incorrect because, as previously mentioned, the buyer can also <br/>bring an action for damages against the licensee. The buyer can also sue for rescission of the contract.  <br/></p>
<p>Question 721 <br/>Answer: 3 <br/>Option (3) is correct because all companies must have an official records office. At that office, any person can <br/>look over the incorporation documents of the company. Option (1) is incorrect because the common law has <br/>been altered by statute to make it possible for companies incorporated under the Business Corporations Act to <br/>ratify a pre-incorporation contract by act or conduct. Option (2) is incorrect because different ratification rules <br/>apply to companies operating in British Columbia that are incorporated under federal or another province&#8217;s <br/>legislation. These rules may, therefore, restrict the legal capacity of a corporation to enter a contract. </p>


<p>Question 722  <br/>Answer: 3 <br/>Option (3) is correct because the Real Estate Services Rules (the &#8220;Rules&#8221;) restate these duties so that the British <br/>Columbia Financial Services Authority can initiate disciplinary proceedings against the licensee independently <br/>of any common law action that a client may bring against the licensee. Option (1) is incorrect because the client <br/>will not be able to receive additional damages under the Rules. Option (2) is incorrect because a client can only <br/>bring action against a licensee for breaching his or her common law duties, not for a breach of the Rules. Option <br/>(4) is incorrect because when the Rules simply restate a common law fiduciary duty, it will not be easier (or <br/>more difficult) to prove a breach of either. <br/></p>
<p>Question 723 <br/>Answer: 2 <br/>Press Display <br/>6 &#61568; NOM% 6 <br/>2 &#61568; P/YR 2 <br/>&#61568; EFF% 6.09 <br/>12 &#61568; P/YR 12 <br/>&#61568; NOM% 5.926346 <br/>99200 PV 99,200 <br/>300 N 300 <br/>0 FV 0 <br/>PMT  &#61473;634.68817 <br/> <br/>The monthly payment required to amortize the loan is $634.69. <br/></p>
<p>Question 724 <br/>Answer: 3 <br/>Option (3) is correct because the wall-to-wall carpeting that Akiko removed is most likely a fixture, and <br/>therefore was included in the purchase price (i.e., should have remained with the property when it was sold). <br/>Per Stack v. T. Eaton Co., articles affixed to the land even slightly &#8211; as the wall-to-wall carpeting is &#8211; are <br/>presumed to be part of the land. The purpose of affixing the carpeting was most likely to improve the den; <br/>therefore, the presumption that the carpeting is a fixture is unlikely to be overturned. Option (1) is incorrect <br/>because a throw rug is not attached to the land (except by its own weight), and therefore is presumed to be a <br/>chattel. Unless stipulated in the contract of purchase and sale, chattels are excluded from the purchase price of <br/>real property. Option (2) is incorrect because the stained glass window is most likely a chattel. The stained glass <br/>window, being attached (via hooks), will initially be presumed a fixture (per Stack v. T. Eaton Co.). However, this <br/>presumption is easily overturned. The window is affixed only slightly, being hung on two hooks, and therefore <br/>is quite easily removed. Additionally, since the antique window is merely hung in front of the living room <br/>window, it serves no apparent structural function. Therefore, the purpose of affixing the stained glass window <br/>is most likely to better enjoy the window as a decorative piece (similar to a painting), rather than to improve the <br/>land.  <br/></p>
<p>Question 725 <br/>Answer: 3 <br/>Option (3) is the correct answer. Appraisals are required to determine the value of real property because it is <br/>difficult to find properties that are very much alike. Unlike real property, other financial assets such as stocks <br/>are more homogenous and will have an explicitly determined price. Options (1), (2), and (4) are incorrect. </p>


<p>Question 726 <br/>Answer: 3 <br/>Option (3) is correct because concrete framing is the most common type of construction today for high-rise <br/>apartment buildings. This is because most high-rise residential buildings normally require a two-hour <br/>fire-rating for floors and columns and concrete will achieve this rating without any additional protection for <br/>most applications. Options (1), (2), and (4) are incorrect. <br/></p>
<p>Question 727 <br/>Answer: 3 <br/>Option (3) is correct because it is the owner&#8217;s responsibility to comply with work orders from public authorities <br/>in respect of a strata lot. This is why section 85 of the Strata Corporation Act requires owners to reimburse the <br/>strata corporation for the cost of work done by the strata corporation following the owner&#8217;s failure to comply <br/>with a work order from a public or local authority under section 85 of the Act. Option (1) is incorrect because <br/>the Strata Property Act requires the strata corporation to obtain and maintain full-replacement-value property <br/>insurance against harm to the common property. Option (2) is incorrect because the Strata Property Act <br/>requires every strata corporation to have an operating fund for common expenses that usually occur one or <br/>more times each year. Option (4) is incorrect because the Strata Property Act requires every strata corporation <br/>to establish a contingency reserve fund for expenses that usually occur less often than once a year or that do not <br/>usually occur. <br/></p>
<p>Question 728 <br/>Answer: 3 <br/>Option (3) is correct because Deborah, as Susan&#8217;s agent, owed Susan a duty to make complete disclosure of <br/>everything relevant to the transaction within Deborah&#8217;s knowledge. Regardless of whether or not Deborah <br/>thought that the redevelopment would increase or decrease the value of the property, Deborah had a duty to <br/>advise Susan of the redevelopment because it might in some way have affected Susan&#8217;s decision. Option (4) is <br/>incorrect for the same reason. Option (1) is incorrect because, where an agent has breached any duties to the <br/>principal, which Deborah has done, the agent&#8217;s right to commission will probably be lost. Therefore, Susan <br/>likely does have a claim against Deborah for the commission paid to Susan. In addition, Susan may have a <br/>potential claim against Deborah if she can prove that the property could have been sold for more had Deborah <br/>advised her of the redevelopment. Option (2) is incorrect because, in this scenario, Deborah did not owe a duty <br/>to Jennifer (a third party) not to advise Susan of the redevelopment.  <br/></p>
<p>Question 729 <br/>Answer: 2 <br/>Option (2) is correct because local enterprise zones are not a level of local law created under the Local <br/>Government Act. Options (1), (3), and (4) are incorrect because these are all levels of local government. <br/></p>
<p>Question 730 <br/>Answer: 2 <br/>Option (2) is correct because Alan should register a caveat, which will prevent the transfer of the property, and <br/>stay on the register for two months. This will give Alan time to commence a court action, if he so chooses. <br/>Option (1) is incorrect because Luke is not yet able to file a Certificate of Pending Litigation, because a court <br/>action has not yet been commenced. Option (3) is incorrect because Alan has not yet obtained a judgment <br/>against Luke, and thus is not able to register a judgment. Option (4) is incorrect because Alan has not obtained <br/>an Order of Possession, and thus is not yet entitled to hire a bailiff.  </p>


<p>Question 731 <br/>Answer: 1  <br/> Option (1) is correct because the buyer in a real estate transaction assumes responsibility for the taxes from the <br/>adjustment date onwards. Since Pat is assuming responsibility for the taxes on January 1, the first day of the <br/>year, no adjustment is necessary. Remember that property taxes are paid for a calendar year, even though they <br/>are usually due on July 1. Options (2), (3), and (4) are incorrect, because no adjustment is necessary for property <br/>taxes in this scenario, and therefore property taxes will not appear as a debit or credit on either the buyer&#8217;s or <br/>seller&#8217;s statement of adjustments. <br/></p>
<p>Question 732 <br/>Answer: 4 <br/>Option (4) is the correct answer (and Options (1), (2), and (3) are incorrect) as the farmhouse situated on land <br/>zoned for commercial use is likely to be the only option that has redevelopment potential. <br/></p>
<p>Question 733 <br/>Answer: 1 <br/>Option (1) is correct because when using a rating grid, the subject property is the standard of comparison and <br/>each comparable sale is adjusted to it. The subject property is not adjusted to the comparables nor are the <br/>comparables adjusted to each other. Option (2) is incorrect because the correct approach is to determine which <br/>comparable is most like the subject property and use that as main evidence for the final market value, not to <br/>average the value of the comparable sale prices. Option (3) is incorrect because the comparable properties do <br/>not require the same square footage of improvements as the subject property. Option (4) is incorrect because <br/>the comparable properties need not have the same lot size as the subject property. <br/></p>
<p>Question 734 <br/>Answer: 4 <br/>Option (4) is correct and Options (1), (2), and (3) are incorrect because since the comparable does not have an <br/>alarm system and the subject property does, there is a +$4,500 adjustment for the alarm system. In addition, <br/>since the subject property has 200 square feet less than the comparable, an adjustment for &#8211;$12,000 is also <br/>required.  <br/></p>
<p>Question 735 <br/>Answer: 3 <br/>Option (3) is correct (false) because the value of the comparable must be adjusted downwards to account for the <br/>benefit provided by the below-market vendor financing. Options (1), (2), and (4) are incorrect because they are <br/>true. <br/></p>
<p>Question 736 <br/>Answer: 1 <br/>Option (1) is correct because to find the adjusted sale price of the comparable, take the sum of the listed sale <br/>price with its adjustments to the subject property. In this case, the subject property and the comparable are <br/>identical except that the subject property has 1 additional bedroom, 1 additional bathroom, and 100 square feet <br/>less. The adjusted sale price is: $245,000 + $4,000 +$5,700 &#8211; $6,000 = $248,700. Options (2), (3), and (4) are <br/>therefore incorrect. </p>


<p>Question 737 <br/>Answer: 3 <br/>Option (3) is correct because marketable securities is the only account listed that is classified as a current asset. <br/>Option (1) represents an owner&#8217;s equity account, Option (2) represents a current liability account, and Option <br/>(4) represents a revenue account. <br/></p>
<p>Question 738 <br/>Answer: 3 <br/>Option (3) is correct because geographic information system (GIS) mapping is a form of computer-based <br/>mapping that incorporates several layers of information beyond what a traditional map can tell you. GIS maps <br/>can integrate details on lot size and dimensions, zoning bylaws applicable to the parcel, ownership details, <br/>environmental restrictions, etc. Options (1), (2), and (4) do not perform this function.  <br/></p>
<p>Question 739 <br/>Answer: 2 <br/>Option (2) is correct because an interest accruing loan represents the greatest risk to the lender, since the entire <br/>amount of principal and interest is at risk for the entire length of the term. Options (1), (3), and (4) represent <br/>loans with lesser risk to the lender. <br/></p>
<p>Question 740 <br/>Answer: 2 <br/>Option (2) is correct because depreciation expense is an accounting concept that attempts to allocate the cost of <br/>an asset over the life of the asset. Option (1) is incorrect because capital cost allowance and depreciation <br/>expense are separate frameworks that both attempt to allocate the cost of an asset over the asset&#8217;s life. The <br/>difference is that depreciation expense is used for financial statements, and capital cost allowance is used for <br/>tax deductions. Option (3) is incorrect because land is not a depreciable asset. Option (4) is incorrect because <br/>this option describes the CCA framework. <br/></p>
<p>Question 741 <br/>Answer: 2 <br/>Option (2) is correct because, in Canada, the courts of equity and the common law courts are combined, <br/>meaning that judges in all provinces (except Quebec) can apply both common law and equitable principles in <br/>deciding cases brought before them. Option (1) is incorrect for the same reason. Option (3) is incorrect because, <br/>where there is a conflict between common law and equitable principles, equitable principles take priority. <br/>Option (4) is incorrect because Option (2) is true.  <br/></p>

<p>Question 743 <br/>Answer: 4 <br/>Option (4) is the correct answer. Option (1) is incorrect because under section 49 of the Residential Tenancy Act, <br/>a landlord may end a tenancy agreement if they intend to renovate or repair a rental unit in a manner that <br/>requires it to be vacant. Option (2) is incorrect because if a tenant intends to return, they will have a right of first <br/>refusal to enter into a new tenancy agreement. Option (3) is incorrect the landlord has the right to determine <br/>the rate of rent in the new tenancy agreement. <br/></p>
<p>Question 744 <br/>Answer: 4 <br/>To solve for the outstanding balance owing at the end of the term, first determine the monthly payment under <br/>the loan.

<p>Question 745 <br/>Answer: 4 <br/>Option (4) is correct because the owner of a freehold strata lot holds a fee simple interest in the strata lot, and a <br/>proportionate fee simple interest in the common property as a tenant in common. Option (1) is incorrect <br/>because a fee simple interest is held in both the strata lot and the common property. Option (2) is incorrect <br/>because the fee simple interest in the common property is held as a tenant in common, not as a joint tenant. <br/>Option (3) is incorrect because a strata lot owner possesses a fee simple interest in the strata lot, rather than <br/>merely a license to occupy the strata lot.  </p>

<p>Question 748 <br/>Answer: 2 <br/>Option (2) is correct because Part 4 of the Assessment Act provides for the establishment of Property <br/>Assessment Review Panels as the first level of appeal from property assessments. Any person who is dissatisfied <br/>with the Property Assessment Review Panel&#8217;s decision may appeal to the Property Assessment Appeal Board. <br/>An appeal on a point of law may subsequently be made from the Property Assessment Appeal Board to the <br/>Supreme Court of British Columbia.

<p>Question 749 <br/>Answer: 4  <br/>To answer this question, calculate the maximum amount of money that can be lent out given the two <br/>constraints: the loan-to-value amount and the gross debt service ratio amount. Calculate the loan amount for <br/>the loan-to-value constraint and then calculate the loan amount for the GDSR constraint. In order to determine <br/>the maximum amount that the lender will advance, choose the lesser of the two results.  <br/> <br/>LTV = 80%  <br/></p>
<p> <br/>Lending Value = $338,000  <br/>Maximum loan under lender&#8217;s LTV criteria = 0.8 &#215; $338,000 = $270,400 <br/> <br/></p>
<p>GDSR = 30%  <br/> <br/></p>

<p> <br/>The loan states that monthly payments are required so:  <br/> <br/></p>
<p>P+I = $21,200 &#247; 12 = $1,766.67 (monthly mortgage payment)  <br/> <br/></p>

<p>Question 750 <br/>Answer: 2 <br/>Option (2) is correct because revocation must always be actually communicated to be effective. Option (1) is <br/>incorrect because an offeror can revoke their offer at any time prior to acceptance, regardless of whether or not <br/>the previously stated time limit has expired. Option (3) is incorrect because there is no requirement that the <br/>offeror give reasonable notice to the offeree before revoking the offer. Option (4) is incorrect because there is no <br/>requirement that the offeror give any pre-determined period of notice before revoking the offer.  </p>


<p>Question 751 <br/>Answer: 1 <br/>Option (1) is correct because section 60 of the Real Estate Services Rules prohibits entering into an agreement <br/>for payment on the basis of a net listing, which is the difference between the price at which real estate is listed <br/>for sale, lease or other disposition, and the actual amount realized. Options (2), (3), and (4) are incorrect because <br/>this type of commission arrangement is expressly prohibited under section 60 of the Real Estate Services Rules, <br/>and therefore cannot be agreed to.  <br/></p>
<p>Question 752 <br/>Answer: 4 <br/>Option (4) is correct because when a loan has a term that is shorter than the amortization period, it is a partially <br/>amortized loan, i.e., a partially amortized repayment scheme. Options (1), (2), and (3) are therefore incorrect. <br/></p>
<p>Question 753 <br/>Answer: 4 <br/>Option (4) is the correct answer as interest rates on treasury bills represent short-term national economic <br/>factors. Options (1), (2), and (3) represent longer-term economic factors. <br/></p>
<p>Question 754  <br/>Answer: 4 <br/>For this question, calculate the NOI from the information given. Then, use the given yield/cap rate on the <br/>comparable property to estimate the value of the subject property. Note that gross realized income is given, not <br/>the gross potential income. This means that you only have to deduct expenses from gross realized income to <br/>determine NOI.  <br/> <br/></p>
<p>NOI = Gross Realized Income &#61473; Expenses  <br/>$26,350 = $44,200 &#61473; $17,850 <br/></p>

<p>Question 758 <br/>Answer: 2 <br/>Lengthening the amortization period means that more time is allowed for the borrower to pay off the loan. For <br/>constant payment mortgage loans, the initial first payments are composed of a greater portion of interest, <br/>whereas the last payments are composed of a greater portion of principal payments.

Therefore, Option <br/>(2) is correct. Your payments have decreased and you are stretching out the time needed to pay of off the loan. <br/>You are paying more interest, and since interest is paid more at the beginning than at the end of the loan, your <br/>payments on principal are delayed; therefore, at each point in time, the amount outstanding on your principal <br/>will be greater. </p>

Therefore, Options (1), (3), and (4) are <br/>incorrect. <br/></p>
<p>Question 761 <br/>Answer: 1 <br/>Option (1) is correct because section 56 of the Real Estate Services Rules requires a licensee to disclose to his or <br/>her brokerage the full amount of commission received or anticipated as a result of providing real estate <br/>services. Option (2) is incorrect because at common law, an agent is any person who contracts to act for or on <br/>behalf of another. Therefore, failing to tell anyone of this $3,000 payment does not breach the common law <br/>principles of agency law. Option (3) is incorrect because Option (2) is false. Option (4) is incorrect because <br/>Option (1) is true. <br/></p>
<p>Question 762 <br/>Answer: 1 <br/>Option (1) is correct because section 2 of the Strata Property Act states that the owners of the strata lots in the <br/>strata plan are members of the strata corporation, once the strata plan is deposited in the land title office. <br/>Option (2) is incorrect because the strata corporation includes all of the individual strata owners, not just <br/>elected representatives. Option (3) is incorrect because strata owners own privately owned (divided) strata lots <br/>in fee simple, and own common property as tenants in common. Option (4) is incorrect because a strata <br/>corporation is comprised of the individual strata owners collectively, not a group of professional managers <br/>hired to perform this role. <br/></p>
<p>Question 763 <br/>Answer: 2 <br/>Option (2) is correct because a landlord can give notice to end a tenancy so that a family member can occupy <br/>the premises, but only if this potential occupier is the landlord, or a spouse, child, or parent of the landlord or <br/>landlord&#8217;s spouse. Option (1) is incorrect because a landlord may end a tenancy if the tenant or a person <br/>permitted on the residential property by the tenant has significantly interfered with or unreasonably disturbed <br/>another occupant or the landlord of the residential property. Option (3) is incorrect because a landlord may end <br/>a tenancy if rent is a tenant is repeatedly late paying rent. Option (4) is incorrect because a landlord may give <br/>the tenant a notice of the end of the tenancy if the tenant does not pay the security deposit within 30 days of the <br/>date it is required to do so under the tenancy agreement.  </p>


<p>Question 764 <br/>Answer: 1 <br/>Option (1) is correct because a trustee is an individual or entity in whose name a property is held, in trust for <br/>the benefit of another person, known as the beneficiary. Option (2) is incorrect because the person who the <br/>property is held for the benefit of is known as the beneficiary. Option (3) is incorrect because while an executor <br/>may seek assistance in handling a transfer of title from an estate, the title will normally be put into the name of <br/>the executor, rather than a financial institution. Option (4) is incorrect because the family members or friends <br/>of an incapable person will typically be appointed to make decisions on their behalf, and the Public Guardian <br/>and Trustee is generally only appointed where none are available or willing to act. <br/></p>
<p>Question 765 <br/>Answer: 4 <br/>Option (4) is correct because the Standard Bylaws can be amended by a strata corporation passing their own <br/>bylaw restricting pets, and is therefore false. Option (1) is incorrect because Karl purchased his lot after the <br/>bylaw was passed, and is therefore true. Option (2) is incorrect because bylaws prohibiting pets do not apply to <br/>pets living with an owner, tenant, or occupant at the time the bylaw is passed, and is therefore true. Option (3) is <br/>incorrect because the Strata Property Act allows for pet restriction bylaws to be passed, and is therefore true.  <br/></p>
<p>Question 766 <br/>Answer: 1 <br/>Option (1) is correct because the most common advertising contravention for which a penalty may be imposed is <br/>failing to display the name of a licensee&#8217;s brokerage on an advertisement in a &#8220;prominent and easily readable way&#8221; <br/>as is required under section 40(2) of the Rules. Option (2) is incorrect because it is the second most common <br/>advertising contravention.

<p>Question 768 <br/>Answer: 4 <br/>Option (4) is correct because if a person standing on the porch is able to look straight down a hallway into the <br/>main bathroom when the front door is open, this is not considered to be physical curable depreciation but <br/>rather functional and likely incurable. Option (1) is incorrect because this is considered a design deficiency in <br/>today&#8217;s market. Options (2) and (3) are incorrect because this describes a patent defect since it is visible, and <br/>functional depreciation under the cost approach of appraisal.  </p>


<p>Question 769 <br/>Answer: 2 <br/>Option (2) is correct because section 3(1) of the Occupiers Liability Act requires an occupier of premises to take <br/>that care that in all the circumstances is reasonable to see that a person will be reasonably safe in using the <br/>premises. By taking these steps, it is likely that Laura met the requisite standard of care and would not be liable. <br/>Option (1) is incorrect because an occupier owes a duty of care under the Occupiers Liability Act even to <br/>trespassers, unless they are trespassing while committing or having the intention to commit a criminal act. <br/>Option (3) is incorrect because an occupier is defined in the Occupiers Liability Act as a person who is in <br/>physical possession of premises, and does not depend on the length of the lease. Option (4) is incorrect because <br/>Laura will only be liable to Howard for his damages if she breached the standard of care owed to Howard, <br/>making her negligent.  <br/></p>

<p>Question 772 <br/>Answer: 1 <br/>Option (1) is correct because in British Columbia, under the Torrens system of land title registration, all <br/>mortgages are registered as charges against the title. Options (2), (3), and (4) are incorrect because mortgages are <br/>registered only as charges.  </p>


<p>Question 773 <br/>Answer: 3 <br/>Option (3) is correct because a truss is a prefabricated frame component that supports the roof. Option (1) refers <br/>to a dormer, Option (2) refers to a header, and Option (4) refers to one of the many components of a septic tank. <br/></p>

<p>Question 775 <br/>Answer: 1 <br/>Option (1) describes the correct order of components in a wood-frame exterior wall from the inside out. Options <br/>(2), (3), and (4) are incorrect because any other order of these components will result in undesirable appearance <br/>or function of the walls. <br/></p>
<p>Question 776 <br/>Answer: 1 <br/>Option (1) is correct because between 1900-1920, interest only loans were the primary form of repayment for <br/>residential mortgage financing. After the Depression, long-term fully amortized loans were the primary form of <br/>repayment for residential mortgage financing. Options (2), (3), and (4) are therefore incorrect. <br/></p>
<p>Question 777 <br/>Answer: 4 <br/>Option (4) is correct because a patent defect will not discharge a contract as the principle of &#8220;caveat emptor&#8221; (let <br/>the buyer beware) applies, and so the purchaser must take the risk of these patent defects. Option (1) is incorrect <br/>because a contract can be discharged by an agreement between the parties to waive full compliance with the <br/>terms of the contract. Option (2) is incorrect because a contract can be discharged by frustration. Option (3) is <br/>incorrect because once the final act of performance occurs, the contract is discharged. </p>


<p>Question 778 <br/>Answer: 3 <br/>Option (3) is correct because a licence is a contractual agreement and so does not &#8220;run with the land&#8221; and bind <br/>successors in title as an interest in land would. The distinction between a licence and a lease is based on <br/>intention based on whether the parties to the agreement intend to grant an interest in land, or simply create a <br/>licence to occupy. Option (1) is incorrect because Larry granted a licence, not a lease. Option (2) is incorrect <br/>because the agreement is a licence and therefore is not enforceable against successors. Option (4) is incorrect <br/>because the agreement is a licence. <br/></p>
<p>Question 779 <br/>Answer: 2 <br/>Option (2) is correct because both a broker and a representative employed by the broker can be disciplined <br/>jointly. Option (1) is incorrect because the Real Estate Services Act grants power to the British Columbia <br/>Financial Services Authority (BCFSA) to subject brokers to disciplinary hearings for the actions of their <br/>representatives, and therefore is true. Option (3) is incorrect because section 43 of the Real Estate Services Act <br/>allows for the suspension of the broker&#8217;s licence, and is therefore true. Option (4) is incorrect because the Real <br/>Estate Services Act requires that BCFSA publish all orders on its website and provide copies to any person upon <br/>request, and is therefore true.  <br/></p>
<p>Question 780 <br/>Answer: 2 <br/>Option (2) is correct because plates, studs, and lintels are found in the wall frame. Options (1), (3), and (4) are <br/>therefore incorrect. <br/></p>
<p>Question 781 <br/>Answer: 4 <br/>Option (4) is correct because capital gains are exempt from taxation where the property sold was the seller&#8217;s <br/>principal residence. Options (1), (2), and (3) are incorrect because they do not fall within the principal residence <br/>exception, and either 50 or 100% of the profit realized on the sale of the property would be taxed depending on <br/>whether it is considered a true capital gain or instead, business income. <br/></p>
<p>Question 782 <br/>Answer: 4 <br/>Option (4) is correct because the deposit paid directly to the seller will reduce the cash proceeds to be received <br/>by the seller upon completion, which is reflected as a debit, and will reduce the balance due from the buyer to <br/>complete, which is reflected as a credit. Options (1) and (3) are incorrect because the amount of the deposit will <br/>appear both on the buyer&#8217;s and seller&#8217;s statements of adjustments. Option (2) is incorrect because the amount <br/>will appear as a credit on the buyer&#8217;s statement and a debit on the seller&#8217;s statement. <br/></p>
<p>Question 783 <br/>Answer: 3 <br/>Option (3) is correct because specific performance is an equitable remedy granted at the discretion of the court <br/>and will not be exercised when damages are considered to be an adequate remedy. Option (1) is incorrect <br/>because a limited company can be granted specific performance at the court&#8217;s discretion. Option (2) is incorrect <br/>because a court can award specific performance if a defendant is without means. Option (4) is incorrect because <br/>even if the contract has already been partially performed, the court still has the discretion to award specific <br/>performance.  </p>


<p>Question 784 <br/>Answer: 3  <br/>This question is solved in two parts. First, calculate the interest rate on the mortgage, which will be a j12.

<p>Question 785 <br/>Answer: 3 <br/>Option (3) is correct because a corporation is owned by one or more shareholders. Option (1) is incorrect <br/>because a corporation is a separate legal entity, and so can be sued just as a natural person can be. Option (2) is <br/>incorrect because shareholders are liable only for the value of the shares purchased or agreed to be purchased, <br/>and have no further responsibility for the debts of the company once the cost of their shares have been fully <br/>paid. Option (4) is incorrect because a corporation has its own income tax status, and pays tax at a flat rate.  <br/></p>
<p>Question 786 <br/>Answer: 1 <br/>Option (1) is correct because firewalls are hardware and software boundaries frequently used to prevent <br/>unauthorized users from accessing private computers or networks connected to the internet. All data <br/>attempting to pass through the firewall is blocked unless it meets a certain criteria of authorization needed to <br/>pass through. Options (2), (3), and (4) are incorrect as they do not describe the purpose of firewalls. <br/></p>
<p>Question 787 <br/>Answer: 4 <br/>Option (4) is correct because it is not a common covenant of the borrower to waive rescission rights. Option (1) <br/>is incorrect because this is a substantial clause commonly used which states that the mortgagor will duly pay all <br/>taxes, levies and assessments whatsoever affecting the land and all premiums for insurance effected pursuant <br/>to this mortgage. Option (2) is incorrect because this is a substantial clause commonly used which states that <br/>the mortgagor will keep the land and the buildings thereof in good condition and repair, and he will not <br/>abandon or commit waste upon the same. Option (3) is incorrect because this provision can be found in column <br/>1 of the Land Transfer Form Act, Part 3, and is also a substantial clause commonly used instead of the standard <br/>clause contained in column 1. </p>

<p>Question 789 <br/>Answer: 1 <br/>Option (1) is correct because anti-virus and malware protection programs include an auto-update feature <br/>(automatic update) that instructs the program to download profiles (also called definitions) of new viruses and <br/>malware from the manufacturer&#8217;s website. Options (2), (3), and (4) do not describe typical auto-update features. <br/></p>
<p>Question 790 <br/>Answer: 2 <br/>Option (2) is correct because the terms rise and run refer to the specification of stair sizes. The rise is the height <br/>difference of each step, and the run is the depth of the step. Options (1), (3), and (4) are incorrect because rise <br/>and run are not typically used to describe windows, framing, or roofs. </p>


<p>Question 791 <br/>Answer: 2 <br/>Option (2) is the best evidence of market value due to the similarity and recency of the sale. Option (1) is <br/>incorrect because the list price of the property is a subjective value, and appraisers are interested in the <br/>objective value that arises from a sale. Option (3) is incorrect because it appears that the property was not at its <br/>highest and best use, and that it was purchased by a special purchaser. Option (4) is incorrect as the rushed <br/>motivation to sell may have an unpredictable influence on the sale price. <br/></p>
<p>Question 792 <br/>Answer: 1 <br/>The first step for this question is to calculate the monthly payment and outstanding balance owing at the end of <br/>the 5-year term based on the contract interest rate; the second step is to calculate the market value of the <br/>mortgage based on the market rate; the final step is to calculate the market value of the offer. Since each unit is <br/>priced at $132,000 and the mortgage loan is for $102,000, the down payment is $30,000. To calculate the market <br/>value of the offer, add the cash down payment to the market value of the mortgage. <br/> <br/>Press Display <br/>9.25 &#61568; NOM% 9.25 <br/>2 &#61568; P/YR 2 <br/>&#61568; EFF% 9.463906 <br/>12 &#61568; P/YR 12 <br/>&#61568; NOM% 9.076624 <br/>102000 PV 102,000 <br/>240 N 240 <br/>0 FV 0 <br/>PMT  &#61473;922.752986 <br/>922.75 +/&#61473; PMT  &#61473;922.75 <br/>60 INPUT &#61568; AMORT PER 60-60 <br/>= = =  90,570.109331 <br/>90570.11 +/&#61473; FV &#61473;90,570.11  <br/>8 &#61568; NOM% 8 <br/>2 &#61568; P/YR 2 <br/>&#61568; EFF% 8.16 <br/>12 &#61568; P/YR 12 <br/>&#61568; NOM% 7.869836 <br/>60 N 60 <br/>PV  106,834.620887 (market value of the mortgage) <br/>+ 30000 =  136,834.620887 (market value of the offer) <br/> <br/>The market value of the offer is $136,835, rounded to the nearest dollar. <br/></p>
<p>Question 793 <br/>Answer: 2 <br/>Option (2) is correct. Option (1) is incorrect because an appeal from the small claims court is taken to the British <br/>Columbia Supreme Court. Option (3) is incorrect because the Supreme Court of Canada can decide not to hear <br/>an appeal from the BC Court of Appeal. Option (4) is incorrect because an appeal from the small claims court is <br/>at the BC Supreme Court and is heard by one judge. </p>


<p>Question 794 <br/>Answer: 3 <br/>Option (3) is correct because, in British Columbia, the indefeasibility principle means that any registered owner <br/>who acquires a fee simple estate in good faith (honestly) and for valuable consideration (a reasonable price, <br/>given the circumstances and market value) is protected by our land title system. In other words, if a person is <br/>named on a certificate of title as the owner of the fee simple estate in land, then that is conclusive proof, as far as <br/>the world is concerned, that he or she is entitled to that fee simple estate. Option (1) is incorrect because it <br/>describes the common law doctrine of the void deed which was overruled by the principle of indefeasibility. <br/>Option (2) is incorrect because it also describes the common law doctrine of the void deed, which is sometimes <br/>referred to as nemo dat quad non habet, or &#8220;one cannot give what one does not have&#8221;. Option (4) is incorrect <br/>because the principle of indefeasibility relies on a certificate of title, and not who the previous owner names as <br/>the new owner of an estate in land. <br/></p>

<p>Question 796 <br/>Answer: 2 <br/>Option (2) is correct because if the landlord and tenant do not enter into a new agreement before the expiry <br/>date, and the tenant continues to occupy the premises, the landlord and the tenant are presumed to have <br/>renewed the original agreement as a month-to-month tenancy. Therefore, Options (1), (3), and (4) are incorrect.  <br/></p>

<p>Question 799 <br/>Answer: 4 <br/>Option (4) is correct because the process model of buying behaviour helps explain how consumers go about the <br/>purchase of shopping goods (i.e., real estate services) and looks at the buying process from the consumer&#8217;s <br/>perspective. A felt need is the initial need or trigger that starts the buying process. In real estate, many events <br/>can trigger the felt need to buy or sell a property. Options (1), (2), and (3) are incorrect because they are not the <br/>correct term for this initial trigger in the process model for buying behaviour. <br/></p>
<p>Question 800 <br/>Answer: 4 <br/>Option (4) is correct because reminder-oriented messages focus on keeping the product, service, or licensee at <br/>the consumer&#8217;s &#8220;top-of-mind.&#8221; Option (1) is incorrect because informational messages are designed to provide <br/>information and create awareness. Option (2) is incorrect because persuasive messages are aimed at generating <br/>a response from the recipient, such as making a phone call or sending an e-mail. Option (3) is incorrect because <br/>appeal message is a term not used in this course. <br/></p>
<p>Question 801 <br/>Answer: 4 <br/>Option (4) is correct. Option (1) is incorrect because if the seller has already paid the current year&#8217;s taxes, the <br/>seller must be reimbursed for that portion of the year from and including the adjustment date. This will be a <br/>debit to the buyer and a credit to the seller. Option (2) is incorrect because the seller is responsible for the full <br/>amount of any penalty. It is not adjusted because only the seller was liable to pay and failed to do so in a timely <br/>manner. The buyer would be debited their portion of taxes from the adjustment date to December 31, and the <br/>seller would be credited the buyer&#8217;s portion of taxes and debited the whole year&#8217;s taxes due plus any late <br/>penalties. Option (3) is incorrect because if the taxes are not yet due, an estimate of the charge will have to be <br/>made.  <br/></p>
<p>Question 802 <br/>Answer: 1 <br/>Option (1) is correct because the value of the subject property calls for the adjustment of +$4,200 and we know <br/>that the market value of one bedroom is $4,200. So if the subject property is adjusted up by $4,200, we know <br/>that the subject property must have one more bedroom than the comparable (4 bedrooms in subject). There is a <br/>&#8211;$2,600 adjustment for bathrooms; therefore, the subject property has one less bathroom than the comparable <br/>(3 bathrooms in subject). Therefore, Options (2), (3), and (4) are incorrect. <br/></p>
<p>Question 803 <br/>Answer: 4 <br/>Option (4) is correct because in the comparative approach of appraisal, it is most important that the subject <br/>building and the comparable buildings be similar with respect to factors judged important by buyers and <br/>sellers. Options (1), (2), and (3) are incorrect because similarity is only required for those factors that have a <br/>material influence on buyers and sellers, and the sale prices they negotiate. </p>


<p>Question 804 <br/>Answer: 3  <br/>Option (3) is correct because an owner of a fee simple estate has the greatest bundle of rights over his or her <br/>land that can be held in Canada, which includes the right to sell, rent, or lease the estate. Option (1) is incorrect <br/>because the term &#8220;fee&#8221; means that the estate can be inherited. Option (2) is incorrect because if the owner of a <br/>fee simple estate dies without a will, the owner&#8217;s heirs will inherit the estate in fee simple with the priority of the <br/>heirs being determined by the laws of intestate succession. Option (4) is incorrect because a fee simple estate <br/>has rights to the land for so long as he or she has heirs.  <br/></p>
<p>Question 805 <br/>Answer: 3  <br/>Option (3) is correct. Option (1) is incorrect because where the rules of equity and common law conflict, <br/>equitable principles take priority. Option (2) is incorrect because equitable remedies are awarded at the <br/>discretion of the court. Option (4) is incorrect because damages are a common law remedy.  <br/></p>
<p>Question 806 <br/>Answer: 2 <br/>Option (2) is correct because unlike in residential tenancies, there is no general obligation on either the <br/>landlord or tenant to repair commercial premises. Option (1) is incorrect because the contract does not have to <br/>be registered to be enforceable between the parties. Option (3) is incorrect because there is an implied covenant <br/>that the tenant will deliver up the premises as he or she found them, fair wear and tear excepted. Option (4) is <br/>incorrect because there is no obligation on the landlord to repair.  <br/></p>
<p>Question 807 <br/>Answer: 2 <br/>For this question, set the present value equal to $23,000; solve for the future value of the investment.

<p>Question 808 <br/>Answer: 1 <br/>Option (1) is correct because a deposit is not required in order for a contract of purchase and sale to be <br/>enforceable. Options (2), (3), and (4) are incorrect because they are all requirements for an enforceable contract <br/>of purchase and sale. <br/></p>
<p>Question 809 <br/>Answer: 4 <br/>Option (4) is correct because fixed-term residential tenancies automatically convert to a month-to-month <br/>periodic tenancy unless the parties have agreed in writing otherwise. Option (1) is incorrect because the <br/>resulting periodic tenancy does not include a rent increase of ten percent. Option (2) is incorrect because if the <br/>rent was expressed yearly, the new implied tenancy would be from year-to-year. Option (3) is incorrect because <br/>a periodic commercial tenancy can be terminated by either party by giving &#8220;reasonable&#8221; notice to the other.  </p>


<p>Question 810 <br/>Answer: 3 <br/>Option (3) is the correct answer as it is the only option listed that is not a motivation to invest in real estate. <br/>Investing in real estate is typically long term, and requires a high outlay of capital, so it will not provide <br/>short-term funds to acquire chattels. Options (1), (2), and (4) are incorrect because they are all primary motives <br/>to invest. <br/></p>
<p>Question 811 <br/>Answer: 3 <br/>Option (3) is correct because ownership can be divided. Options (1), (2), and (4) are significant characteristics of <br/>improved land.  <br/></p>
<p>Question 812 <br/>Answer: 1 <br/>Option (1) is correct because the role most often played by legislation is to change the common law. Option (2) is <br/>incorrect because the common law develops a system of precedent. Option (3) is incorrect because the power of <br/>the government to make laws is set out in our Constitution, which cannot be amended by an ordinary statute. <br/>Option (4) is incorrect because legislation is not used as a means to publicize important judicial decisions.  <br/></p>
<p>Question 813 <br/>Answer: 1 <br/>Option (1) is correct because this transfer of personal property is a credit to the buyer as it reduces the amount <br/>that the buyer owes, and is a debit to the seller as it reduces the amount of cash proceeds of sale due to the <br/>seller. Options (2) and (3) are incorrect because this transfer will appear on the statement of adjustment of both <br/>the buyer and seller. Option (4) is incorrect because a debit to the buyer would increase the amount owed to the <br/>seller, and a credit to the seller increases the cash the seller will receive on closing. <br/></p>
<p>Question 814 <br/>Answer: 2 <br/>Option (2) is correct because the common law provides tenants with various rights such the right to quiet <br/>enjoyment and the right to derogation from grant. Options (1) and (3) are incorrect because the Commercial <br/>Tenancy Act and Rent Distress Act apply to commercial, not residential, tenancies.  <br/></p>
<p>Question 815 <br/>Answer: 3 <br/>Option (3) is the correct answer because a transportation facility is the only option that is likely to be both a <br/>positive and a negative externality. The transportation facility is likely to be positive because of easier access to <br/>transit, as well as negative due to unwanted noise and traffic. Options (1), (2), and (4) are incorrect as they <br/>represent only a positive or a negative externality. </p>

To calculate the nominal interest rate that the investor <br/>will earn, change the present value to $220,500, the amount that the investor pays. <br/> <br/>Press Display <br/>11.5 I/YR 11.5 <br/>12 &#61568; P/YR 12 <br/>217200 PV 217,200 <br/>240 N 240 <br/>0 FV 0 <br/>PMT  &#61473;2,316.28516 <br/>2316.29 +/&#61473; PMT &#61473;2,316.29 <br/>220500 PV 220,500 <br/>I/YR  11.267747(j12) <br/>&#61568; EFF% 11.868261(j1) <br/>2 &#61568; P/YR 2 <br/>&#61568; NOM%  11.535586(j2) <br/></p>
<p>Question 817 <br/>Answer: 4 <br/>Option (4) is correct because these are all amounts owed by the buyer. Option (1) is incorrect because the <br/>balance due to complete is a credit on the buyer&#8217;s statement of adjustments. Option (2) is incorrect because the <br/>deposit paid and the balance due to complete are credits on the buyer&#8217;s statement of adjustments. Option (3) is <br/>incorrect because these are all credits on the buyer&#8217;s statement of adjustments.  <br/></p>
<p>Question 818 <br/>Answer: 4 <br/>Option (4) is correct because Elisa is responsible for 48/365 days for property taxes as the buyer is responsible <br/>for the adjustment date. The total property taxes is estimated to be $1324 &#215; 1.1 = $1456.40. Therefore, Elisa&#8217;s <br/>portion is $1456.40 &#215; (48/365) = $191.53. This is a debit on the seller&#8217;s statement of adjustments as it will reduce <br/>the cash proceeds due to her. Option (1) is incorrect because this value does not reflect the expected 10% <br/>increase in the current year&#8217;s property taxes. Options (2) and (3) are incorrect because the seller&#8217;s portion of the <br/>property taxes appears as a debit on the seller&#8217;s statement as it reduces the cash proceeds due to the seller.  </p>


<p>Question 819 <br/>Answer: 2 <br/>Option (2) is correct because the brokerage&#8217;s commission of $10,220, the seller&#8217;s portion of property taxes of <br/>$191.53, the assumption of Anya&#8217;s first mortgage of $123,544, the second mortgage of $23,000, and the <br/>discharge fees for the second mortgage of $75 are all debits on the seller&#8217;s statement, and the sale price of <br/>$448,000 is a credit on the seller&#8217; statement. Options (1), (3), and (4) are incorrect because the cash proceeds of <br/>sale which will be received by Anya is $290,969.47. <br/><b> <br/>Seller&#8217;s Statement of Adjustments (Anya)</b> <br/><b>ITEM    DEBIT CREDIT <br/></b>Purchase Price  448,000.00 <br/>Commission  10,220.00  <br/>Seller's Share of Taxes*     <b>191.53</b>  <br/>Assumption of 1st Mortgage 123,544.00  <br/>Discharge of 2nd Mortgage  23,000.00  <br/>Legal Fees (discharge of 2nd Mortgage)      75.00  <br/>Cash Proceeds of Sale** <b>290,969.47</b> _________ <br/> 448,000.00 448,000.00 <br/>* $1,324 &#61512; 1.10 = $1,456.40 (Jan. 1-Feb. 17 = 48 days)  <br/></p>
<p>48/365 &#61512; $1,456.40 = $191.53 <br/>** Because the total Debits and Credits must balance, in order to find the Proceeds of Sale, you must first calculate the total Credits <br/></p>

<p>Question 821 <br/>Answer: 4 <br/>Option (4) is correct because a common shareholder of a corporation is liable only for the value of the shares <br/>purchased or agreed to be purchased. Option (1) is incorrect as each common share allows for one vote at the <br/>annual general meeting of the corporation. Options (2) and (3) are incorrect as common shareholders indirectly <br/>share the income of the corporation, in the form of dividends. <br/></p>
<p>Question 822 <br/>Answer: 1 <br/>Option (1) is correct because when a property possesses latent value it is implied that the property is not <br/>currently employed at its highest and best use, and this latent value could be realized if the property were <br/>redeveloped to the highest and best use. Options (2), (3), and (4) are incorrect because they are not implications <br/>of latent value. <br/></p>

<p>Question 824 <br/>Answer: 1 <br/>Option (1) is correct because while a fee simple estate is the greatest estate in land, the owner of the estate in fee <br/>simple is not the absolute owner. This is because underlying title in all land in British Columbia is held by the <br/>Crown. Option (2) is incorrect because a fee simple estate does not always have clear title. Option (3) is incorrect <br/>because the term &#8220;fee simple&#8221; is still used today to describe the greatest interest in land, and has not been <br/>abolished. Option (4) is incorrect because fee simple is a form of estate in land. </p>


<p>Question 825 <br/>Answer: 4 <br/>The first step is to calculate the monthly payments at the contract rate; the second step is to calculate the OSB at <br/>the end of the term and set this equal to the future value; the third step is to calculate the market value of the <br/>mortgage at the market rate.

<p>Question 826 <br/>Answer: 3 <br/>Option (3) is correct because a registered fee simple acquired bona fide for value without knowledge of an <br/>earlier fraudulent dealing in the land is indefeasible. Options (1), (2), and (4) are correct because these are all <br/>exceptions to the indefeasibility principle. <br/></p>
<p>Question 827 <br/>Answer: 4 <br/>Option (4) is correct because it is the responsibility of a real estate board to enforce the Code of Ethics and <br/>Standards of Business Practices, not the Superintendent of Real Estate (the &#8220;Superintendent&#8221;). Options (1), (2), <br/>and (3) are incorrect because they are all duties of the Superintendent as stated in the Real Estate Services Act.  </p>


<p>Question 828 <br/>Answer: 4 <br/>Option (4) is correct because the common law rule of interesse termini provides that no estate in land passes <br/>until the tenant takes possession. Option (1) is incorrect because a term which is contrary to the Commercial <br/>Tenancy Act is void and unenforceable. Option (2) is incorrect because the implied covenant of quiet enjoyment <br/>is an assurance to the tenant against the consequences of a defective title. Option (3) is incorrect because section <br/>32 of the Residential Tenancy Act states that a tenant is not required to make repairs for reasonable wear and <br/>tear. <br/></p>
<p>Question 829 <br/>Answer: 2 <br/>Option (2) is correct and Options (1), (3), and (4) are incorrect because generally, a brokerage must retain <br/>records for at least seven years after their creation (section 92 of the Real Estate Services Rules). <br/></p>
<p>Question 830 <br/>Answer: 2 <br/>Option (2) is correct because specific performance and injunctions are equitable remedies available at the <br/>discretion of the court.

Option (4) is incorrect because a judge cannot refuse <br/>to apply any law which is unfair, and cannot refer to a code to ascertain the law. <br/></p>
<p>Question 831 <br/>Answer: 4 <br/>Option (4) is correct and Options (1), (2), and (3) are incorrect because a reverse annuity mortgage is an <br/>innovative loan arrangement where the lender makes periodic payments to the borrower and at the end of the <br/>term, the borrower repays the balance.  <br/></p>
<p>Question 832 <br/>Answer: 4 <br/>Option (4) is correct if a court issues a judgment against the strata corporation, the judgment is against all the <br/>owners. Options (1), (2), and (3) are incorrect because the Strata Property Act permits these remedies.  <br/></p>
<p>Question 833 <br/>Answer: 1  <br/>To calculate the depreciation expense for Fanny&#8217;s building, calculate the value of the building minus the <br/>salvage value. This will give us the amount to be depreciated. The straight-line depreciation expense equals the <br/>amount to be depreciated divided by the number of years. <br/> <br/></p>
<p>Value of the building: $225,000 &#61473; $100,000 = $125,000 <br/>Value to be depreciated = $125,000 &#61473; $25,000 = $100,000 <br/> <br/>Straight line depreciation = $100,000 &#247; 10 = $10,000  <br/></p>

<p>Question 835 <br/>Answer: 4 <br/>Option (4) is correct because an equitable mortgage cannot be prohibited by statue. If a mortgage is <br/>unregistrable for procedural reasons, then it is an equitable mortgage. Options (1), (2), and (3) are incorrect <br/>because they are all examples of equitable mortgages.  <br/></p>
<p>Question 836 <br/>Answer: 4 <br/>Option (4) is correct because interests in land are said to &#8220;run with the land&#8221;, so the doctrine of privity of <br/>contract does not apply to contracts creating an interest in land. Option (1) is incorrect because the easement is <br/>enforceable between Scott and Alice because the easement is an interest in land which is not subject to the <br/>doctrine of privity of contract. Option (2) is incorrect because since interests in land &#8220;run with the land&#8221;, and do <br/>not &#8220;run with the owner&#8221;. Option (3) is incorrect because all interests in land &#8220;run with the land&#8221;, not only rights <br/>of way.  <br/></p>
<p>Question 837 <br/>Answer: 1 <br/>Option (1) is correct; the Canadian Electrical Code requires minimum electrical service capacity of 100 amps for <br/>houses at least 80 square meters. Most houses of this size will have greater electrical service capacity of 125, 150, <br/>or 200 amps. Options (2), (3), and (4) are therefore incorrect.  <br/></p>
<p>Question 838 <br/>Answer: 3 <br/>Option (3) is correct because a registered property owner who is a widow or widower may make an application <br/>to defer the property taxes payable on their principal place of residence.

<p>Question 839 <br/>Answer: 3 <br/>Option (3) is correct because a deposit is not an essential element of a binding contract. The 7 essential elements <br/>are offer, acceptance, consideration, legal intention, capacity, legal object, and genuine consent. Options (1), (2), <br/>and (4) are incorrect because they are all essentials for the formation of a binding contract.  </p>


<p>Question 840 <br/>Answer: 2  <br/>For this question, use the following three formulas: <br/> <br/></p>
<p>NOIMarket Value =<br/>Cap Rate<br/></p>
<p>  <br/> <br/></p>
<p>NOICap Rate =<br/>Market Value<br/></p>
<p>  <br/> <br/>NOI = Gross Potential Income &#61473; Vacancy &#61473; Current Operating Expenses <br/></p>
<p> <br/>Calculate the NOI for each of the three properties and the cap rate for the two comparable properties. <br/> <br/></p>
<p>Comparable A:  NOI = $45,000 &#61473; $4,500 &#61473; $30,000 = $10,500 <br/> Cap Rate = $10,500 &#247; $210,000 = 0.05  <br/> <br/>Comparable B:  NOI = $49,000 &#61473; $4,900 &#61473; $32,000 = $12,100 <br/>  Cap Rate = $12,100 &#247; $220,000 = 0.055  <br/></p>
<p> <br/>The cap rate used to calculate the market value of the subject property is the one that most reflects the subject <br/>property and is determined by several factors. For the purposes of this question, the two most comparable <br/>properties have been selected and a range of values is determined. <br/> <br/></p>
<p>Subject Property: NOI = $54,000 &#61473; $5,400 &#61473; $36,000 = $12,600 <br/> <br/>Market value using cap rate from Comparable A: <br/>Market Value = $12,600 &#247; 0.05 = $252,000 <br/> <br/>Market value using cap rate from Comparable B: <br/>Market Value = $12,600 &#247; 0.055 = $229,090.91 or $229,000 (rounded) <br/></p>
<p> <br/>The subject property&#8217;s market value estimate is in the range of $229,000 to $252,000, (rounded to the nearest <br/>$1,000). <br/></p>
<p>Question 841 <br/>Answer: 4 <br/>Option (4) is correct because an easement or right-of-way, building scheme, and leasehold are all interests in <br/>land that can be valued. An easement or right-of-way affects the value of the properties involved depending on <br/>the location of the easement. A building scheme, which is a type of restrictive covenant, must benefit or <br/>enhance the value of the covenantee&#8217;s land in some way. A leasehold estate has great economic value and <br/>grants important rights to land. Options (1), (2), and (3) are incorrect because they are all interests in land that <br/>can be valued. </p>


<p>Question 842 <br/>Answer: 3 <br/>Note: We are given the gross realized revenue, so vacancy is already included.  <br/> <br/>A reminder: Gross potential revenue &#61473; vacancy = gross realized revenue <br/> <br/>Find the yield/cap rate of Comparable A and B, then determine a range for the market value of the subject <br/>property using these two cap rates. <br/> <br/></p>
<p>A: $47,000 &#61473; $29,000 = $18,000 &#247; $210,000 = 8.571429% <br/>B: $52,000 &#61473; $34,000 = $18,000 &#247; $225,000 = 8% <br/> <br/>Subject Property: NOI = $56,000 &#61473; $37,000 = $19,000 <br/> <br/>Market value using cap rate from Comparable A: <br/>Market value = $19,000 &#247; 8.571429% = $221,666.67 or $222,000 (rounded) <br/> <br/>Market value using cap rate from Comparable B: <br/>Market value = $19,000 &#247; 8% = $237,500 or $238,000 (rounded) <br/></p>
<p> <br/>The subject property&#8217;s market value estimate is in the range of $222,000 to $238,000 (rounded to the nearest <br/>$1,000). <br/></p>
<p>Question 843 <br/>Answer: 3 <br/>Option (3) is correct (false); the maximum CCA in a given year is equal to the undepreciated capital cost (UCC) <br/>multiplied by the CCA percentage. Options (1), (2), and (4) are incorrect because they are true. <br/></p>
<p>Question 844 <br/>Answer: 3 <br/>Option (3) is correct because in 2001, CMHC launched Canada Mortgage Bonds to increase the supply of low <br/>cost mortgage funds in Canada, and provide easy access to investment in Canadian residential mortgages. The <br/>Canada Mortgage Trust is the organization created by CMHC that issues these bonds. Options (1), (2), and (4) are <br/>incorrect because the CMHC did not create virtual banks, Ginnie Mae Mortgage-Backed Securities, or credit <br/>unions. <br/></p>
<p>Question 845 <br/>Answer: 4 <br/>Option (4) is correct because Options (1), (2), and (3) are all incorrect. Option (1) is incorrect because Larry is <br/>liable to the buyer in negligence because he did not exercise reasonable care and skill by relying only on <br/>information from the seller. Option (2) is incorrect because the seller does have a duty to disclose this defect to <br/>the buyer because it is likely a latent defect. Option (3) is incorrect because the seller can still be liable for <br/>misrepresentation because there is a relationship between the seller and the buyer giving rise to a duty of care.  </p>


<p>Question 846 <br/>Answer: 3 <br/>Option (3) is correct because if a party seeking to enforce the contract has reasonably relied on the existence of a <br/>contract and in doing so has altered his or her position, a court may enforce the contract if only its enforcement <br/>will prevent an unfair result. Option (1) is incorrect because the Law and Equity Act writing requirement <br/>applies even when a buyer and seller agree on the terms of the sale. Option (2) is incorrect because a contract <br/>not in writing is not void, but may be unenforceable. Option (4) is incorrect because if the party denying the <br/>contract has done some act that indicates the contract was made, they will be &#8220;estopped&#8221; from denying its <br/>existence.  <br/></p>
<p>Question 847 <br/>Answer: 1 <br/>Option (1) is correct because a real estate professional has an ethical duty to present all options, which is <br/>implicit in the duty to advise fully, candidly and honestly. Therefore, Options (2), (3), and (4) are incorrect.  <br/></p>
<p>Question 848 <br/>Answer: 2 <br/>Option (2) is correct because Devco has potentially breached various statutes. Option (1) is incorrect because <br/>this could potentially be a breach of the federal Competition Act which is designed to hold business actors <br/>accountable for misleading, deceptive, or anti-competitive practices. Option (3) is incorrect because the Real <br/>Estate Services Rules prohibits licensees from knowingly publishing real estate advertising containing any false <br/>statement or representation concerning real estate, a trade in real estate, or the provision of real estate services. <br/>Option (4) is incorrect because the Real Estate Services Rules requires licensees to disclose their interests in the <br/>property to potential buyers. <br/></p>
<p>Question 849 <br/>Answer: 2 <br/>Option (2) is correct because when a life estate is created for one party with the remainder going to another <br/>party in fee simple, the interest the second party holds is known as a remainderman. Therefore, Options (1), (3), <br/>and (4) are incorrect.  <br/></p>
<p>Question 850 <br/>Answer: 3 <br/>Option (3) is correct because making a substantial change to Mary&#8217;s offer would be considered a counter-offer. <br/>The counter-offer becomes the new offer, which terminates the original offer. Option (1) is incorrect because if <br/>acceptance by mail is appropriate, then the &#8220;postal acceptance rule&#8221; applies, making the acceptance effective as <br/>soon as it is put in the mailbox, rather when it is actually received. Option (2) is incorrect because the party who <br/>made the offer can revoke it at any time before it is accepted. Option (4) is incorrect because while a <br/>counter-offer terminates the original offer, an offeree&#8217;s minor request for information does not terminate an <br/>offer.  </p>


<p>Question 851 <br/>Answer: 2 <br/>For this question, calculate the mortgage amount based on the two constraints of the loan-to-value and debt <br/>service ratio. The maximum loan allowable will be the amount that satisfies both constraints: therefore, it is the <br/>lower amount of the two. <br/> <br/>LTV = 80%  <br/></p>
<p> <br/>Lending Value = $208,000 <br/>Maximum loan under lender&#8217;s LTV criteria = 0.8 &#215; $208,000 = $166,400 <br/> <br/></p>
<p>GDSR = 30%  <br/> <br/>The Mortgagor&#8217;s gross income is $35,000 + ($30,000 &#215; 0.75) = $57,500 <br/> <br/></p>
<p>P I T P I $1,900GDSR 0.30<br/>GI $57,500<br/>+ + + +<br/></p>

<p> <br/>The loan states that monthly payments are required so:  <br/> <br/></p>
<p>P+I = $15,350 &#247; 12 = $1,279.17 (monthly mortgage payment)  <br/> <br/>Press Display <br/>7.5 &#61568; NOM% 7.5 <br/>2 &#61568; P/YR 2 <br/>&#61568; EFF% 7.640625 <br/>12 &#61568; P/YR 12 <br/>&#61568; NOM% 7.385429 <br/>1279.17 +/&#8211; PMT &#8211;1,279.17 <br/>300 N 300 <br/>0 FV 0 <br/>PV 174,856.31915 <br/> <br/>The maximum loan under the GDSR is $174,856.  <br/>Therefore, the maximum mortgage is the lower of the two loan amounts: $166,400.  <br/></p>
<p>Question 852  <br/>Answer: 3  <br/>The loan-to-value ratio is the maximum loan divided by the lending value. <br/></p>
<p>$268,000 &#247; $335,000 = 0.8  </p>


<p>Question 853 <br/>Answer: 3 <br/>Option (3) is correct because under the Constitution Act, 1867, the provincial governments were given <br/>jurisdiction over matters affecting private property and were also empowered to delegate some provincial <br/>powers to local governments. Option (1) is incorrect because the Constitution Act, 1867 gave the provincial <br/>government jurisdiction over matters affecting private property, not the federal government. Option (2) is <br/>incorrect because although the province has delegated most authority to regulate land use to local <br/>governments, the provincial government has maintained certain power such as through the Agricultural Land <br/>Commission Act. Option (4) is incorrect because the Heritage Conservation Act also gives local governments the <br/>authority to impose restrictions on a private landowner&#8217;s use of their land.  <br/></p>
<p>Question 854 <br/>Answer: 2 <br/>Option (2) is correct because Mr. Falcon&#8217;s need for a quick sale is likely to result in a lower sale price. Options <br/>(1), (3), and (4) are incorrect because they would not cause Mr. Finch&#8217;s home to sell for a lower value. <br/></p>
<p>Question 855 <br/>Answer: 3 <br/>Option (3) is correct because unless there is an express prohibition in the lease, a tenant under a commercial <br/>lease may assign without the consent of the landlord. Option (1) is incorrect because a commercial tenant can <br/>assign a lease unless the lease expressly prohibits them from doing so. Option (2) is incorrect because the <br/>landlord is not required to give his/her consent for an assignment of a commercial lease. Option (4) is incorrect <br/>because a tenant can assign a commercial lease even if the lease permits subletting the premises. <br/></p>
<p>Question 856 <br/>Answer: 2 <br/>Option (2) is correct because at common law, once a &#8220;break&#8221; in the chain of title occurred, all subsequent <br/>transfers or other dealings with the land were of no effect because of the maxim nemo dat quod non habet. <br/>Option (1) is incorrect because the current &#8220;owner&#8221; would lose the title and would have no remedy other than to <br/>sue the person from whom he or she had bought the land. Option (3) is incorrect because a deed given in <br/>exchange for an illegal act or thing is a void deed. Option (4) is incorrect because a current fee simple &#8220;owner&#8221; <br/>could have certainty of title after the 20 year limitation period for lawsuits to recover a land title transferred by <br/>a void deed had expired.  <br/></p>
<p>Question 857 <br/>Answer: 2 <br/>The correct answer is Option (2) because a property with a particularly attractive view may be worth much <br/>more than a property without a view. Option (1) is incorrect; the quality of aesthetic factors that can be <br/>corrected economically, such as landscaping, do not have an impact on appraised values. Option (3) is also <br/>incorrect because a one-year difference in age in a relatively new home is unlikely to have a material impact on <br/>appraised values. Option (4) is incorrect because the weather is unlikely to have a material impact on appraised <br/>values. </p>

<p>Question 859 <br/>Answer: 2 <br/>Option (2) is correct because it is only an offence under section 52 of the Competition Act if the false <br/>advertisement is misleading in a material respect. Option (1) is incorrect because the forms of advertising <br/>covered by section 52 are extremely broad, and include representations in print, oral, and digital form. Option <br/>(3) is incorrect because the courts will consider both the literal meaning and general impression of the <br/>advertisement to determine whether the representation is false or misleading in a material respect. Option (4) is <br/>incorrect because an accused may escape liability under section 52 if they honestly believed that the <br/>representation or advertisements were not false or misleading and that they exercised due diligence in making <br/>sure that was the case.  <br/></p>
<p>Question 860 <br/>Answer: 4 <br/>Option (4) is correct because authority can be revoked by an act of the principal that is inconsistent with the <br/>continuation of authority. Options (1), (2), and (3) are incorrect because these events will not terminate a real <br/>estate agency relationship.  <br/></p>
<p>Question 861 <br/>Answer: 3  <br/>Option (3) is correct because in an agreement for sale, the vendor &#8220;lends&#8221; the purchaser some portion of the <br/>purchase price but remains the owner of the property. The purchaser repays this amount to the vendor by way <br/>of instalments, and the vendor transfers title to the purchaser when the entire amount has been repaid. <br/>Therefore, Options (1), (2), and (4) are incorrect. <br/></p>
<p>Question 862 <br/>Answer: 1 <br/>Option (1) is correct because a person selling a neighbour&#8217;s house for a flat fee is not exempted from the <br/>requirements to be licensed under the Real Estate Services Act. Option (2) is incorrect because appraisers and <br/>property inspectors are exempted from having a license with respect to trading services.

<p>Question 863 <br/>Answer: 1 <br/>Option (1) is correct because section 49 of the Real Estate Services Rules prohibits licensees from making a <br/>promise to buy or sell any real estate belonging to a prospective buyer unless at the time the licensee makes the <br/>promise, he or she gives a signed statement containing the details of the promise to the person to whom it is <br/>made. Option (2) is incorrect because a trading services representative does not have to have lined up a buyer <br/>for the property before making a promise to buy or sell any real estate belonging to a prospective buyer. Option <br/>(3) is incorrect because a trading services representative is not required to first obtain authorization by the <br/>brokerage before making such a promise.

<p>Question 865 <br/>Answer: 4 <br/>Option (4) is correct because copyright law protects software. Option (1) is incorrect because even though you <br/>pay a price for software, it is licensed to the user, not an &#8220;ownership&#8221; purchase. Option (2) is incorrect because <br/>the licence agreement contains a fair use clause, which restricts copying the software for friends, colleagues, <br/>and making copies for resale. Option (3) is incorrect because copying and reselling software is generally not <br/>legally permissible. <br/></p>
<p>Question 866 <br/>Answer: 3 <br/>Option (3) is correct because the Strata Property Act does not permit a strata corporation to prohibit strata lot <br/>owners from selling their lots to non-residents of British Columbia. Option (1) is incorrect because the Strata <br/>Property Act permits a strata corporation to control, manage, and administer the common property and <br/>common assets of the corporation for the benefit of the owners. Option (2) is incorrect because the Strata <br/>Property Act permits the strata corporation to file a lien in the land title office against a strata lot for money <br/>owing to the corporation. Option (4) is incorrect because the Strata Property Act permits a strata corporation to <br/>deny an owner, tenant, occupant, or visitor the use of the recreational facility that is common property for a <br/>reasonable length of time. <br/></p>
<p>Question 867 <br/>Answer: 2 <br/>Option (2) is correct because an agent&#8217;s authority to act on behalf of his principal may not arise contingently. <br/>Options (1), (3), and (4) are incorrect because an agency relationship is commonly created expressly, by <br/>implication, or by ratification by the principal of the agent&#8217;s acts done on the principal&#8217;s behalf.  </p>


<p>Question 868  <br/>Answer: 1  <br/>For this question, calculate the mortgage amount based on the constraints of loan-to-value and debt coverage <br/>ratio. The maximum loan allowable will be the amount that satisfies both constraints; therefore, it is the lower <br/>amount of the two. <br/> <br/>LTV constraint: $880,000 &#215; 0.80 = $704,000 <br/> <br/>Using DCR constraint, calculate maximum allowable payments.  <br/> <br/></p>

<p>Question 869 <br/>Answer: 4 <br/>Option (4) is correct because the factory was in compliance with the industrial use permitted by the zoning <br/>bylaw when it was built, and so it will be permitted to continue as a legal non-conforming use after the area is <br/>rezoned to residential use. Option (1) is incorrect because this is an example of an illegal secondary suite. The <br/>fact that the municipality is aware of the suite does not make the suite legal; rather, the city could elect to <br/>enforce its bylaws at any time. Option (2) is incorrect because the grocery was non-compliant with the bylaw <br/>even before it was amended, so the use was never legal. Option (3) is incorrect because an addition cannot be <br/>made to a building used for a non-conforming use unless it is required by law or permitted by a board of <br/>variance. <br/></p>
<p>Question 870 <br/>Answer: 4 <br/>Option (4) is correct because section 44 of the Residential Tenancy Act states that a tenant vacating or <br/>abandoning the rental unit will result in the end of a tenancy agreement. Option (1) is incorrect because a <br/>residential landlord cannot distrain a tenant&#8217;s goods for arrears of rent. Option (2) is incorrect because section <br/>32 of the Residential Tenancy Act imposes an obligation on the landlord to repair all types of residential <br/>premises. Option (3) is incorrect because there is no obligation to register a lease of three years or less to secure <br/>a tenant&#8217;s rights against subsequent owners of the leased premises. </p>


<p>Question 871 <br/>Answer: 4 <br/>Option (4) is correct because a manufactured home is not required to be registered. Option (1) is incorrect <br/>because under section 7 of the Manufactured Home Act, the transfer is not effective, except between the parties <br/>to the transfer, unless both the home and the transfer are registered. Option (2) is incorrect because the <br/>Manufactured Home Act prohibits any person from importing into British Columbia unless ownership is <br/>registered. Option (3) is incorrect because the registrar will assign a manufactured home a registration number <br/>upon satisfactory completion of the initial registration, and issue two decals bearing that number.  <br/></p>
<p>Question 872 <br/>Answer: 3 <br/>Option (3) is correct because a wood-fired space heater may not provide steady consistent heat. Rooms that are <br/>not space heated will remain cool. Options (1), (2), and (4) are incorrect because they are true. A wood-fired <br/>space heater can reduce the overall heating expense by providing an additional source of heat that does not rely <br/>on electricity or gas. This type of heating is frequently described as comfortable heat because it provides both <br/>radiant and convection heat. In addition, thermostatic controls for temperature and circulation fans are <br/>available.  <br/></p>
<p>Question 873 <br/>Answer: 4 <br/>Option (4) is correct because the undertaking and carrying out of real estate law reform is a duty of the Real <br/>Estate Foundation, not the British Columbia Financial Services Authority (BCFSA).

Option (2) is incorrect because BCFSA may conduct investigations and hold formal disciplinary <br/>processes. Option (3) is incorrect because according to section 53.1 of the Real Estate Services Act, BCFSA may <br/>require the licensee to pay the expenses, or part of the expenses, incurred in relation to either or both of the <br/>investigation and the discipline hearing to which the order relates.  <br/></p>
<p>Question 874 <br/>Answer: 1 <br/>Option (1) is correct because using proven anti-virus and malware software is the most simple, effective, and <br/>reliable method of protecting against viruses. Therefore, Options (2), (3), and (4) are incorrect.  <br/></p>
<p>Question 875 <br/>Answer: 1 <br/>Option (1) is correct because a misrepresentation is a false statement of fact, not of opinion. Option (2) is <br/>incorrect because in order to be a misrepresentation that would entitle the buyer to rescind the contract, the <br/>statement must have induced the other party to enter into the contract. Option (3) is incorrect because the <br/>statement must also be one which would have induced a reasonable person to enter into the contract. Option <br/>(4) is incorrect because in order to claim damages, the seller must have known it was false, or have been reckless <br/>as to its truth or falsehood. <br/></p>
<p>Question 876 <br/>Answer: 3 <br/>Option (3) is correct because damages that are not reasonably foreseeable are considered too &#8220;remote&#8221; in law, <br/>and a plaintiff will not be able to get compensation for them. Option (1) is incorrect because a claim for <br/>negligence is concerned with whether the defendant breached the standard of care owed, not whether they <br/>intended to cause injury or damage to the plaintiff. Option (2) is incorrect because this is a required element for <br/>a successful claim of negligence. Option (4) is incorrect because even if an act was authorized by statute, a <br/>defendant could still be found negligent for the way that act was done.  </p>


<p>Question 877 <br/>Answer: 2 <br/>Option (2) is correct because while a person can assign away benefits under a contract to a third party, a person <br/>generally cannot assign liabilities. Option (1) is incorrect because under the doctrine of privity of contract, only <br/>the parties to a contract can sue or be sued for its breach. Option (3) is incorrect because one exception to the <br/>doctrine of privity of contract is contracts which create an interest in land. Option (4) is incorrect because the <br/>Law and Equity Act states that a statutory assignment must be in writing, must be absolute and unconditional, <br/>and notice must be given in writing to the original promissor.  <br/></p>
<p>Question 878 <br/>Answer: 1  <br/>Option (1) is correct because a judgment against the strata corporation is a judgment against all the owners, and <br/>every strata lot owner is liable to pay the judgment in the portions set out in the Schedule of Unit Entitlement. <br/>Option (2) is incorrect because although the Strata Property Act requires the strata corporation to maintain <br/>insurance against liability for bodily injury, if this insurance does not cover the full judgment, George would <br/>still be liable to pay his proportionate liability. Option (3) is incorrect because the contingency reserve fund is <br/>used for paying for common expenses, not for paying damage awards. Option (4) is incorrect because since <br/>George is an owner, he must pay his proportionate liability. <br/></p>
<p>Question 879 <br/>Answer: 2 <br/>Option (2) is correct because it is a valid defence to private nuisance if the damage caused is trifling and of little <br/>consequence. Option (1) is incorrect because it is no defence to say that the utmost care and skill have been <br/>taken. Option (3) is incorrect because having authority under a municipal business licence is not a defence to <br/>private nuisance. Option (4) is incorrect because it is no defence to say that a person is only making a <br/>reasonable use of his or her property. <br/></p>
<p>Question 880 <br/>Answer: 3 <br/>Option (3) is correct because although Avon is not liable for voluntary, permissive, or ameliorating waste, Avon <br/>would still incur liability for flagrantly or maliciously damaging or destroying the property.

Option (4) is incorrect because Avon is liable for equitable waste. <br/></p>
<p>Question 881 <br/>Answer: 1  <br/>To calculate the straight-line depreciation, take the amount that can be depreciated and then divide by the <br/>number of years. <br/></p>
<p>Straight-line depreciation: $97,835 &#247; 25 = $3,913.40  </p>


<p>Question 882 <br/>Answer: 2 <br/>Option (2) is correct. The easement must be capable of forming the subject matter of a grant, which means that <br/>the easement must be capable of reasonably exact definition. One must be able to identify its boundaries. <br/>Furthermore, the person granting the easement and the person whose land receives the benefit of the easement <br/>must have the necessary capacity to be grantor and grantee. For example, a tenant cannot grant an easement <br/>that binds the property after the tenancy expires. Option (1) is incorrect because an easement can be either <br/>positive or negative in nature (in comparison to a restrictive covenant, which must be negative in nature). <br/>Option (3) is incorrect because one party can own both the dominant and servient tenement provided that they <br/>are two different parcels of land. Option (4) is incorrect because the easement must accommodate the dominant <br/>tenement, not the servient tenement. <br/></p>
<p>Question 883 <br/>Answer: 3 <br/>Option (3) is correct because an order absolute of foreclosure does not wipe all other charges, liens, <br/>encumbrances, and interests off the title. Option (1) is incorrect because once the petitioner has been granted <br/>the order absolute of foreclosure, he or she may not then sue the borrower on the borrower&#8217;s personal covenant. <br/>Option (2) is incorrect because the order absolute of foreclosure declares that the respondents are foreclosed of <br/>any right, title, or interest in the mortgaged property and it directs them to deliver up possession of the property <br/>to the petitioner. Option (4) is incorrect because if the petitioner sells the land, there is no requirement to <br/>account to the borrower for any money received or any profit which might be realized in excess of the <br/>mortgaged debt.  <br/></p>
<p>Question 884 <br/>Answer: 2 <br/>Option (2) is correct because a portable mortgage allows the borrower to sell his or her home and carry the <br/>mortgage over to the purchase of a new home. Because of this portability, the borrower will save money if his or <br/>her mortgage has a lower interest rate than the current interest rate that a new mortgage would be written at. <br/>Option (1) is incorrect because  <br/> <br/>a portable mortgage allows a seller of their home to carry the mortgage over to a purchase of a new home. <br/>Option (3) is incorrect because a portable mortgage cannot also be vendor-supplied. Option (4) is incorrect <br/>because a portable funds fee is not necessarily always charged on a portable mortgage. <br/></p>
<p>Question 885 <br/>Answer: 3 <br/>Option (3) is correct because the Personal Information Protection Act (PIPA), which came into force in January <br/>2004, regulates the way private sector organizations collect, use, keep secure, and disclose personal <br/>information. Options (1), (2), and (4) are incorrect because they do not refer to legislation that regulates personal <br/>information.  </p>


<p>Question 886 <br/>Answer: 4 <br/>Option (4) is correct because a licensee may be exempt from the application of the Real Estate Services Act <br/>(RESA) and the Real Estate Services Rules when the licensee manages rental real estate owned by himself or <br/>herself. To be exempt, the licensee must provide these services in their own name and not in the name of their <br/>related brokerage, must not include any information about their brokerage in advertising the rental real estate, <br/>and must disclose in writing to their managing broker that they will be providing rental property management <br/>services on their own behalf in relation to their own real estate. The licensee must also disclose to each potential <br/>tenant of the rental real estate that even though they are licensed under RESA, they are not acting as a licensee <br/>in this case and are not regulated under RESA in relation to the rental real estate. Options (1), (2), and (3) are <br/>incorrect for this reason.  <br/></p>
<p>Question 887 <br/>Answer: 1 <br/>Option (1) is correct because buyers of cooperatives own shares in the cooperative association or company and <br/>is a tenant, rather than a fee simple owner. Option (2) is incorrect because the disclosure requirements in the <br/>Real Estate Development Marketing Act apply to cooperatives and condominiums. Option (3) is incorrect <br/>because condominiums are generally easier to sell than cooperatives because the cooperative association&#8217;s <br/>board of directors must approve the person who proposes to buy a cooperative owner&#8217;s shares. Option (4) is <br/>incorrect because where a building is being converted to a cooperative, any residential tenants who are <br/>required to move will be entitled to the protections of the Residential Tenancy Act. <br/></p>
<p>Question 888 <br/>Answer: 1 <br/>Option (1) is correct because a brokerage does not have to have a separate trust account for each client. Option <br/>(2) is incorrect because all money received for or on behalf of a client must be put into a trust account as soon as <br/>the brokerage receives it. Option (3) is incorrect because a brokerage is permitted to withdraw money paid into <br/>a trust account if it was paid into the trust account by mistake. Option (4) is incorrect because money paid into a <br/>trust account may be withdrawn to cover expenses incurred on behalf of a client and according to the client&#8217;s <br/>instructions.  <br/></p>

<p>Question 890 <br/>Answer: 2 <br/>Option (2) is correct (i.e., false) because a brokerage&#8217;s real estate commission appears on the seller&#8217;s statement of <br/>adjustments as a debit, and does not appear on the buyer&#8217;s statement of adjustments. Option (1) is incorrect <br/>because where an existing mortgage will be assumed by the buyer and remain on title, the amount of cash due <br/>to the seller is reduced which is reflected as a debit on a seller&#8217;s statement of adjustments. Option (3) is incorrect <br/>because the seller is responsible for property taxes up to the day before the adjustment date, and the buyer is <br/>responsible for the property taxes on the adjustment date. Option (4) is incorrect because a seller&#8217;s portion of <br/>taxes to be paid in the future will reduce the amount required to complete due from the buyer which is <br/>reflected as a credit on a buyer&#8217;s statement of adjustments.  <br/></p>
<p>Question 891 <br/>Answer: 4 <br/>Option (4) is correct because only the principal or agent can terminate the authority. Options (1), (2), and (3) are <br/>incorrect because these are ways that can terminate an agency contract.  <br/></p>
<p>Question 892 <br/>Answer: 4 <br/>Option (4) is correct because all of the statements are true. Option (1) is true because a special buyer is a <br/>potential purchaser that is interested in a particular property because it has a specific attribute, and he or she <br/>may be willing to pay significantly more or less than other buyers. Option (2) is true because real property is <br/>immobile, which causes the market for real property to be local by nature. Option (3) is true because the <br/>neighbourhood an appraiser considers in his or her analysis may not be confined to the subdivision. This will <br/>depend on the abundance of similar recent sales and the appraiser&#8217;s discretion.  <br/></p>
<p>Question 893 <br/>Answer: 3 <br/>Option (3) is correct because unlimited liability means that the owner&#8217;s legal liability is not limited to his or her <br/>initial investment in the company. Sole proprietors and general partners have unlimited liability, whereas <br/>limited partners and corporate shareholders have limited liability. Options (1), (2), and (4) are incorrect <br/>statements. <br/></p>
<p>Question 894 <br/>Answer: 4 <br/>Option (4) is correct and Options (1), (2), and (3) are incorrect because all of the statements are true.

Commercial leases must include the commencement date <br/>and duration of its term.  </p>


<p>Question 895 <br/>Answer: 2 <br/>To calculate the maximum loan amount, calculate the loan amounts based on both the constraint of the <br/>loan-to-value ratio and the gross debt service ratio. The loan-to-value is calculated based on the bank&#8217;s <br/>appraisal of the property. In this case, the amount the bank appraises the property at is $375,000. Once the <br/>payments from the GDSR are calculated, the PV of the loan is calculated, taking into consideration the stress <br/>test qualification rules. The loan amount that satisfies both constraints (the smaller amount) will be the <br/>maximum loan amount.  <br/> <br/>LTV = 80% <br/> <br/>Lending Value = $375,000 <br/>Maximum loan under lender&#8217;s LTV criteria = 0.8 &#215; $375,000 = $300,000 <br/> <br/>GDSR = 32%  <br/> P + I = (GDSR &#215; Gross Income) &#8211; Property Taxes  <br/>P + I = (0.32 &#215; $60,000) &#8211; $1,800  <br/>P + I = $17,400 per year = $1,450 per month <br/> The mortgage qualifying rate is based on the greater of (1) the government-specified qualifying rate of j2 = <br/>5.25% OR (2) an additional 2% above the mortgage&#8217;s negotiated contract rate. In this case, you would apply a <br/>rate of j2 = 5.25%, the government-specified rate, which is greater than the mortgage&#8217;s contract rate plus 2% of j2 <br/>= 5% (2% + 3%). <br/> <br/>Press Display <br/>5.25 &#61568; NOM% 5.25 <br/>2 &#61568; P/YR 2 <br/>&#61568; EFF% 5.318906 <br/>12 &#61568; P/YR 12 <br/>&#61568; NOM%  5.193482 <br/>1450 +/&#8211; PMT &#8211;1,450 <br/>300 N 300 <br/>0 FV 0 <br/>PV 243,322.060330 <br/> <br/>The maximum loan under the GDSR is $243,320, rounded to the nearest $10. The maximum that Jake can <br/>borrow is the lesser of $300,000 (LTV) and $243,320 (GDSR). In this case, Jake can only borrow $243,320, <br/>rounded to the nearest $10.<b></p>
<p>Question 896 <br/>Answer: 2 <br/>Option (2) is correct because the doctrine of the void deed was a component of the common law system, but is <br/>not a component of the British Columbia land title registration system. Options (1), (3), and (4) are incorrect <br/>because they are all components of the British Columbia land title registration system. <br/></p>
<p>Question 897 <br/>Answer: 4 <br/>Option (4) is correct and Options (1), (2), and (3) are incorrect because the plaintiff must first file and serve a <br/>notice of civil claim, then the defendant must file and serve a response to civil claim, then an examination for <br/>discovery is conducted, and finally the judgment is enforced.  </p>


<p>Question 898 <br/>Answer: 3  <br/>Option (3) is correct because it is false. Option (1) is incorrect because lenders and brokers must disclose the <br/>Annual Percentage Rate (APR) to the borrower. Option (2) is incorrect because the APR represents the <br/>borrower&#8217;s contractual interest rate plus any non-interest finance charges. Option (4) is incorrect because in <br/>order to provide borrowers with some help in determining the actual cost of borrowing, most provincial <br/>governments in Canada have legislated that certain disclosure requirements must be met for specific types of <br/>mortgages. However, a disclosure statement must be given to a borrower TWO days prior to the borrower <br/>incurring an obligation under a credit agreement, unless the time period is waived by the borrower in <br/>accordance with Section 15 of the Disclosure of the Cost of Consumer Credit Regulation.  <br/></p>
<p>Question 899 <br/>Answer: 3  <br/>Option (3) is correct because the Real Estate Development Marketing Act, not the Real Estate Services Act, <br/>requires disclosure statements. Options (1), (2), and (4) are incorrect because these are ways in which the Real <br/>Estate Services Act achieves its primary purpose. <br/></p>
<p>Question 900 <br/>Answer: 3  <br/>Option (3) is correct because the legal fees for discharge of the second mortgage, sales commission and <br/>assumption of first mortgage all appear on the vendor&#8217;s statement of adjustments as debits. Options (1) and (4) <br/>are incorrect because the purchaser&#8217;s share of taxes paid appears as a credit on the vendor&#8217;s statement of <br/>adjustments. Option (2) is incorrect because sale price appears as a credit on the vendor&#8217;s statement of <br/>adjustments.  <br/></p>
<p>Question 901 <br/>Answer: 1 <br/>Option (1) is correct because a proprietor&#8217;s net income on the income statement will increase the owner&#8217;s equity <br/>account on the balance sheet. Option (2) is incorrect because net assets is found only on the balance sheet, and <br/>does not link to the income statement. Option (3) is incorrect because depreciation expense is found only on the <br/>income statement, and does not link to the balance sheet. Option (4) is incorrect, because retained earnings is a <br/>link between the income statement and the balance sheet for a corporation only, not a proprietorship. <br/></p>
<p>Question 902 <br/>Answer: 3 <br/>Option (3) is correct because having an existing contractual relationship between the parties is not a <br/>requirement for a successful claim of negligent misrepresentation. Options (1), (2), and (4) are incorrect because <br/>these are all requirements of negligent misrepresentation.  </p>

<p>Question 905 <br/>Answer: 3 <br/>Option (3) is correct and Option (4) is incorrect because statute law always prevails over equitable principles. <br/>Option (1) is incorrect because equitable principles prevail over common law principles. Option (2) is incorrect <br/>because statute law prevails over common law principles.  <br/></p>
<p>Question 906 <br/>Answer: 2 <br/>Option (2) is correct because damproofing is the material applied to foundation walls to seal the pores and <br/>prevent water from penetrating the concrete with capillary action movement. Options (1), (3), and (4) are false. </p>


<p>Question 907 <br/>Answer: 3 <br/>Option (3) is correct because the courts will consider whether the representation would have a real effect upon <br/>an ordinary consumer&#8217;s buying decision. There is no need to prove that an individual consumer or group of <br/>consumers was actually misled. Option (1) is incorrect because the general impression test is considered where <br/>the oral or written statements in the representation are literally true but the visual portion may create a false <br/>impression. Option (2) is incorrect because the representation must be false or misleading in a material respect <br/>to constitute an offence under section 52. Option (4) is incorrect because the accused may escape liability under <br/>section 52 if they honestly believed that the representations or advertisements were not false or misleading and <br/>that they exercised due diligence in making sure that was the case.  <br/></p>
<p>Question 908 <br/>Answer: 1 <br/>Option (1) is correct because FINTRAC is required under the Proceeds of Crime (Money Laundering) and <br/>Terrorist Financing Act to make public all AMPs imposed. Option (2) is incorrect because the issuance of an <br/>AMP is not automatic, and is generally used after other methods for promoting compliance have failed. Option <br/>(3) is incorrect because FINTRAC has discretion to disclose relevant information to law enforcement, depending <br/>on the extent of the non-compliance. Option (4) is incorrect because the maximum penalty which can be <br/>imposed on an individual under an AMP is $100,000. <br/></p>

<p>Question 910 <br/>Answer: 4 <br/>Option (4) is correct because the most obvious difficulty in using the cost approach to value properties is that <br/>cost and market value may not be approximately equal. The cost approach is most applicable to problems <br/>where data is lacking for the income or comparison approaches. Options (1), (2), and (3) are incorrect. <br/></p>
<p>Question 911 <br/>Answer: 2 <br/>Option (2) is correct because the Real Estate Services Act does not require all listings to always be in writing. <br/>Option (1) is incorrect because commission is only paid to the agent who is the effective cause of the sale under <br/>an open listing. Option (3) is incorrect because if the seller disposes of the property to a prospect not introduced <br/>by any of the listing agents, the seller does not pay anyone a commission. Option (4) is incorrect because under <br/>an open listing, the seller is free to employ a number of brokerages to also represent the seller through their <br/>Designated Agents.  </p>


<p>Question 912 <br/>Answer: 4 <br/>Option (4) is correct because the revenue recognition principle states that revenue should be recorded when it is <br/>earned, not when payment is received. In the case of a sale of property, Sandy Salesperson has earned her <br/>commission as soon as the subject clauses are removed. Options (1), (2), and (3) are incorrect as these principles <br/>do not deal with the timing of recognizing revenue. <br/></p>
<p>Question 913 <br/>Answer: 2 <br/>The market value of Sara&#8217;s offer is the market value of the mortgage plus her cash down payment.

<p>Question 914 <br/>Answer: 3 <br/>Option (3) is correct because the Residential Tenancy Act does not permit a landlord to end a residential <br/>tenancy agreement for cause so that the renovations can be performed. Options (1), (2), and (4) are incorrect <br/>because section 47(1) of the Residential Tenancy Act provides that these are examples of a situation in which a <br/>landlord can end a residential tenancy agreement for cause.  <br/></p>
<p>Question 915 <br/>Answer: 4 <br/>Option (4) is correct and Options (1), (2), and (3) are incorrect because a strata lot&#8217;s contribution to an expense is <br/>calculated as the unit entitlement of the strata lot divided by the total unit entitlement of all strata lots <br/>multiplied by the total contribution. Richard&#8217;s unit entitlement is 2,400, the total unit entitlement of all strata <br/>lots is 40,000, and the total contribution is $48,000. Richard&#8217;s annual share of the common expense is $2,880, <br/>and therefore his monthly share is $240.  <br/></p>
<p>Question 916 <br/>Answer: 3 <br/>Option (3) is correct because the type of buyer does not generally factor into the consideration of whether or not <br/>the profit realized on the sale of property was business income (i.e. money earned from an activity carried on <br/>for the purpose of making a profit). On the other hand, the seller&#8217;s actions and intentions are considered in the <br/>decision. Options (1), (2), and (4) are incorrect because they are all factors which are generally considered in <br/>deciding when profit is considered business income rather than a capital gain. </p>


<p>Question 917 <br/>Answer: 4 <br/>Option (4) is correct because it is the only option listed that is not a valid reason to hire a professional appraiser. <br/>Real property typically has relatively long physical and economic lifespans, and it is not very easy to account for <br/>changes over these long time frames. Options (1), (2), and (3) are incorrect because they are all reasons to hire a <br/>professional appraiser.  <br/></p>
<p>Question 918 <br/>Answer: 2 <br/>Option (2) is correct because the Strata Property Act does not require a minimum of $5,000,000 liability <br/>insurance on the strata project. Option (1) is incorrect because the Strata Property Act imposes an obligation on <br/>the strata corporation to repair and maintain the common property and common assets. Option (3) is incorrect <br/>because the Strata Property At requires a contingency reserve fund to be established for unusual or <br/>extraordinary expenses. Option (4) is incorrect because the Strata Property Act requires the strata corporation <br/>to maintain an operating fund for common expenses.  <br/></p>
<p>Question 919 <br/>Answer: 4 <br/>Option (4) is correct because registering a notice of civil claim against the judgment debtor&#8217;s property is not a <br/>means available to judgment creditors to enforce a judgment. Option (1) is incorrect because the plaintiff can <br/>examine the judgment debtor in court under oath about his or her assets and sources of income. Option (2) is <br/>incorrect because the plaintiff can request a writ of execution to be issued by the court to the sheriff directing <br/>the seizure and sale of enough of the debtor&#8217;s assets to pay the judgment plus the costs of seizure. Option (3) is <br/>incorrect because a garnishing order can be served on the judgment debtor&#8217;s bank, requiring the bank to pay <br/>the money into the court instead of to the debtor.  <br/></p>
<p>Question 920 <br/>Answer: 2  <br/>Option (2) is correct (false) because the insurance company guarantees that the lender can recover all of the <br/>funds loaned in case of default, but does not guarantee that borrowers will be able to make their mortgage <br/>payments without interruption. Option (1) is incorrect; lenders may apply a higher loan-to-value ratio to an <br/>insured loan because the insurance reduces risk to the lender. Option (3) is incorrect because the insurance <br/>premiums are typically added to the loan amount. Option (4) is incorrect, as it is the lender that benefits from <br/>the insurance. The borrower may also derive some indirect benefit such as a lower interest rate or higher loan <br/>amount. <br/></p>
<p>Question 921 <br/>Answer: 2 <br/>Option (2) is correct because the comparative approach is generally used for residential properties with <br/>sufficient comparable sales data available. Options (1) and (3) appear too unique for the comparative approach, <br/>and Option (4) appears to be an income-generating investment building, thus the income approach should be <br/>used. <br/></p>
<p>Question 922 <br/>Answer: 3 <br/>Option (3) is correct (false) because Canada has a smaller market share of subprime mortgages than the US. <br/>Options (1), (2), and (4) are incorrect because they are true. </p>


<p>Question 923 <br/>Answer: 1 <br/>Option (1) is correct because an agent is not personally liable if they are mistakenly believed by a third party to <br/>be contracting as a principal. Options (2), (3), and (4) are incorrect because these are the three situations at <br/>common law in which an agent is personally liable to a third party. <br/></p>
<p>Question 924 <br/>Answer: 1 <br/>Option (1) is correct because a deposit is not required to create a binding contract of purchase and sale. Option <br/>(2) is incorrect because where an offer is received with a deposit after banking hours and the seller rejects the <br/>offer before the bank reopens, the cheque may be returned intact to the purchaser. Option (3) is incorrect <br/>because agents hold deposits as stakeholders. Option (4) is incorrect because section 27 of the Real Estate <br/>Services Act requires that all money held or received from, for, or on behalf of a principal in relation to real <br/>estate services, must be promptly paid or delivered by a licensee to his or her brokerage. <br/></p>
<p>Question 925 <br/>Answer: 3 <br/>Option (3) is correct because once a building scheme has been established, the restrictions imposed may be <br/>modified or discharged only by an express agreement between all of the present owners of the lots. Options (1), <br/>(2), and (4) are incorrect because these are all requirements that must be met in order for the arrangement to <br/>constitute a valid building scheme.  <br/></p>
<p>Question 926 <br/>Answer: 2 <br/>Option (2) is correct because when payments are rounded up to the next higher dollar for a fully amortized <br/>loan, the result will be a smaller final payment, and possibly a reduction in the number of payments. This is <br/>because the borrower is &#8220;overpaying&#8221; a slight amount each period. The cumulative effect will depend on the <br/>loan amount, amortization period, and the amount that the payment was rounded up. Options (1), (3), and (4) <br/>are incorrect for this reason.  <br/></p>
<p>Question 927 <br/>Answer: 4 <br/>Option (4) is correct because leases dealing with residential property for a period of over 20 years are not <br/>&#8220;residential tenancies&#8221; and must be dealt with as commercial tenancies. Commercial tenancies are not subject <br/>to the provisions of the Residential Tenancy Act. Options (1), (2), and (3) are incorrect because they are all <br/>situations that are subject to the provision of the Residential Tenancy Act.  <br/></p>
<p>Question 928 <br/>Answer: 3 <br/>Option (3) is correct because central gas fired forced hot air heating systems are advantageous because they <br/>have a rapid response to extreme outside temperature changes. Options (1), (2), and (4) are incorrect because <br/>these heating systems do not provide as fast of a response. </p>


<p>Question 929 <br/>Answer: 4 <br/>The borrower&#8217;s maximum monthly payments are to be 30% of his $2,500 monthly income; in other words, the <br/>borrower&#8217;s maximum monthly payment will be $750 ($2,500 &#215; 0.3). Then, calculate the maximum amount lent, <br/>which is the PV of the monthly payments. <br/> <br/>Press Display <br/>9 &#61568; NOM% 9 <br/>2 &#61568; P/YR 2 <br/>&#61568; EFF% 9.2025 <br/>12 &#61568; P/YR 12 <br/>&#61568; NOM% 8.835748 <br/>0 FV 0 <br/>200 N 200 <br/>750 +/&#61473; PMT &#61473;750 <br/>PV 78,374.008924 <br/></p>
<p>Question 930 <br/>Answer: 4 <br/>Option (4) is correct because the listing contract must be signed by all of the owners. Option (1) is incorrect <br/>because a listing agreement is a contract between a seller and a brokerage and does not involve a buyer. Option <br/>(2) is incorrect because in order for a licensee to be entitled to commission, the licensee must produce a <br/>purchaser whose offer strictly complies with the terms of the listing agreement. Option (3) is incorrect because a <br/>listing brokerage can still be entitled to commission even if it does not have a listing agreement with the seller <br/>prior to listing the property for sale.  <br/></p>
<p>Question 931 <br/>Answer: 1 <br/>Option (1) is correct because depreciation is an accounting concept, and does not relate to contract law. Options <br/>(2), (3), and (4) are incorrect because these are all topics relating to contract law.  <br/></p>
<p>Question 932 <br/>Answer: 1 <br/>Option (1) is correct (false) because the general impression test is used in this situation, which can still result in <br/>a conviction under section 52. Option (2) is incorrect (true) because a misrepresentation will only be contrary to <br/>section 52 of the Competition Act if it is false or misleading in a material respect. Option (3) is incorrect (true) <br/>because section 52 applies to both oral and written misrepresentations. Option (4) is incorrect (true) because the <br/>accused may escape liability under section 52 if they honestly believed that the representations or <br/>advertisements were not false or misleading and that they exercised due diligence in making sure that was the <br/>case.  <br/></p>
<p>Question 933 <br/>Answer: 2 <br/>Option (2) is correct because the agent has a duty to tell his or her client everything relevant to the transaction <br/>within the agent&#8217;s knowledge. Failing to mention that the buyer may be willing to increase the offer is a breach <br/>of the agent&#8217;s legal and ethical duty of full disclosure. Option (1) is incorrect because the agent does not have an <br/>ethical obligation to deal fairly with the buyer at all times. Option (3) is incorrect because this was a breach of <br/>the agent&#8217;s duty of full disclosure, and therefore is not acceptable conduct. Option (4) is incorrect because this is <br/>not an example of the agent&#8217;s duty not to make a secret profit.  </p>


<p>Question 934 <br/>Answer: 2 <br/>Option (2) is correct because the Builders Lien Act gives priority to the lien over a mortgage as of the date the <br/>lien is filed in the Land Title Office. Where part of the money has been advanced and then a builder&#8217;s lien is <br/>filed against the property, the builder&#8217;s lien has priority over further advances made under the mortgage. <br/>Option (1) is incorrect because the advances clause states that all payments are at the discretion of ABC, so it <br/>would not be a breach of the mortgage contract to refuse to pay the second installment. Option (3) is incorrect <br/>because the lien takes priority over all subsequent advancements of funds because of the operation of the <br/>Builders Lien Act. Option (4) is incorrect because allowing a builder&#8217;s lien to remain on title does not constitute <br/>a breach of the mortgage contract.  <br/></p>

<p>Question 936 <br/>Answer: 4 <br/>Option (4) is correct because damages are a common law remedy. Options (1), (2), and (3) are incorrect because <br/>specific performance, injunctions, and quantum meruit are equitable remedies.  <br/></p>
<p>Question 937 <br/>Answer: 4 <br/>Option (4) is correct because the residual method is used for properties that have latent value. Options (1), (2), <br/>and (3) are incorrect because it is not clear whether there is latent value in each situation. <br/></p>

<p>Question 939 <br/>Answer: 2 <br/>Option (2) is correct because the indefeasibility principle means that any registered owner who acquires a fee <br/>simple estate in good faith and for valuable consideration is protected by the land title system. That purchaser <br/>can keep his or her title, even if the previous registered owner acquired title by way of fraud or forgery. Option <br/>(1) is incorrect because the indefeasibility principle allows the purchaser to keep his or her title. Option (3) is <br/>incorrect because Michael did not contribute to his own loss by neglecting to register a lien on his title to <br/>indicate that he was the registered owner. Option (4) is incorrect because the principle of indefeasibility <br/>overrules the common law doctrine of void deed, and so the transfer of the property to the third party was valid <br/>and the purchaser now has indefeasibility of title.  <br/></p>
<p>Question 940 <br/>Answer: 2 <br/>Option (2) is correct because the registration and approval of a strata plan creates an estate in fee simple for <br/>each individual strata lot. Option (1) is incorrect because the approval required to amend the bylaws of the <br/>corporation varies based on the strata type, and whether it is before or after the second annual general meeting. <br/>Option (3) is incorrect because the condominium concept can be utilized for both residential and <br/>non-residential projects. Option (4) is incorrect because all strata lots do not need to be presold before a strata <br/>plan can be registered in the land title office.  <br/></p>

<p>Question 942 <br/>Answer: 1  <br/>Option (1) is incorrect because a mortgage is not a loan, but instead is security for a loan. Options (2), (3), and (4) <br/>are incorrect because these are all true statements concerning mortgages.  <br/></p>
<p>Question 943 <br/>Answer: 4 <br/>Option (4) is correct because all real estate representatives are employed by a managing broker, and trade in <br/>real estate in the brokerage&#8217;s name and on behalf of the brokerage&#8217;s clients. Option (1) is incorrect because a <br/>licensee can only provide real estate services under the supervision of a managing broker. Option (2) is <br/>incorrect because licensees may employ unlicensed assistants, but must ensure that an unlicensed assistant is <br/>not performing any tasks that fall within the definition of &#8220;trading services&#8221;. Option (3) is incorrect because all <br/>representatives must be employed by a registered real estate brokerage.  </p>


<p>Question 944 <br/>Answer: 4 <br/>Option (4) is the correct answer because under designated agency, while the contracting party is still the <br/>brokerage, the seller agrees that the brokerage will appoint one or more specific licensees to act as the seller&#8217;s <br/>sole agent. Options (1) and (2) are incorrect because dual agency, not designated agency, relates to whether a <br/>licensee can or cannot act for both the buyer and seller. Option (3) is incorrect because a listing agreement <br/>involves the seller but not the buyer. <br/></p>
<p>Question 945 <br/>Answer: 2 <br/>Option (2) is correct because the sand blowing onto Ana&#8217;s property, making the tennis court slippery and <br/>hazardous for anyone playing there, is likely to be considered an unreasonable and substantial interference <br/>with the reasonable use and enjoyment of her property, and would therefore be considered a private nuisance. <br/>Option (1) is incorrect because trespass requires an intentional act, and the sand was carried onto Ana&#8217;s <br/>property by the wind, rather than by an intentional act done by Fletcher. Option (3) is incorrect because <br/>Fletcher could still be liable for private nuisance even though the problem occurred because of the wind. <br/>Option (4) is incorrect because the tort of private nuisance does not require the conduct to be done <br/>intentionally.  <br/></p>
<p>Question 946 <br/>Answer: 1  <br/>In this question the given rate is compounded semi-annually; N must be set equal to 2, as there are 2 <br/>semi-annual periods in 12 months. <br/> <br/>Press Display <br/>11.25 I/YR 11.25 <br/>2 &#61568; P/YR 2 <br/>2 N 2 <br/>275000 PV 275,000 <br/>0 PMT 0 <br/>FV  &#61473;306,807.617187 <br/></p>
<p>Question 947 <br/>Answer: 1 <br/>Since we know that the comparable property has one less bedroom, its sale price calls for an adjustment. We <br/>know that the market value of one bedroom is $1,100, so the sale price of the subject property is adjusted up by <br/>$1,100. We also know that the comparable property has a garage, while the subject does not. Since the market <br/>value of a garage is stated to be $7,000, we must adjust the sale price of the comparable down by $7,000. Finally, <br/>it is stated that each 100 sq. ft. above the 2,000 sq. ft. benchmark has a market value of $3,000. Since the <br/>comparable is 200 sq. ft. smaller than the subject, we must adjust the sale price of the comparable up by 200 sq. <br/>ft. &#215; $3,000 = $6,000. <br/> <br/>The adjusted sale price is $173,000 +$1,100 &#61473; $7,000 + $6,000 = $173,100 </p>


<p>Question 948 <br/>Answer: 1 <br/>Option (1) is correct because the owner would have to live in the property as a principal residence for 6 months <br/>in order to avoid the Empty Homes Tax; 3 months is not sufficient. In addition, investors who use their property <br/>as a short term rental without a hotel or B&amp;B license are subject to the EHT where the rental periods are shorter <br/>than 30 days. Option (2) is incorrect because properties which are rented for at least 30 days in a row for a <br/>minimum of six months in aggregate over the course of a year are exempt from the EHT. Options (3) and (4) are <br/>incorrect because the EHT does not apply to properties being used as a principal residence by the owner, a <br/>family member, or a friend for at least six months of the year.  <br/></p>
<p>Question 949 <br/>Answer: 1 <br/>Option (1) is correct. Since there is a -$4,000 adjustment for bedrooms, this comparable has one more bedroom <br/>than the subject (5 bedrooms). In addition, since there is a +$5,700 adjustment for bathrooms, the comparable <br/>has one less bathroom than the subject (3 bathrooms). Options (2), (3), and (4) are therefore incorrect. <br/></p>
<p>Question 950 <br/>Answer: 1 <br/>Option (1) is correct because sophisticated investors will ultimately determine the value of undeveloped land by <br/>estimating the value of the land when improved and subtracting the costs of undertaking such a development. <br/>Options (2), (3), and (4) are incorrect because they do not determine the value of undeveloped land. <br/></p>
<p>Question 951 <br/>Answer: 3 <br/>Option (3) is correct because in relation to the subject property, this comparable requires an adjustment of <br/>+$6,000 for 1 bathroom and +$4,000 for an alarm system. Options (1), (2), and (4) are therefore incorrect. <br/></p>
<p>Question 952 <br/>Answer: 3 <br/>Option (3) is correct and Options (1), (2), and (4) are incorrect because a limitation or restriction placed upon the <br/>use of one person&#8217;s land for the benefit of another is called a restrictive covenant. <br/></p>
<p>Question 953 <br/>Answer: 4 <br/>Option (4) is correct because in a mortgage transaction, the mortgagee is granted the mortgage from the <br/>mortgagor as security for a loan. Options (1), (2), and (3) are incorrect because these options describe the <br/>mortgagor, not the mortgagee.  <br/></p>
<p>Question 954 <br/>Answer: 1  <br/>Option (1) is correct because since the comparable does not have an alarm system and the subject property <br/>does, there is a +$4,500 adjustment for the alarm system. In addition, since the subject property has 100 square <br/>feet less than the comparable, an adjustment for - $6,000 is required. Therefore, Options (2), (3), and (4) are <br/>incorrect. </p>


<p>Question 955 <br/>Answer: 1 <br/>Ernie assumes responsibility for the remaining 36 monthly payments of $3,994 and the outstanding balance of <br/>$433,709.14. Calculate the market value of the mortgage by determining the PV of the remaining payments and <br/>OSB at the end of the original 5-year term based on the current market rate of j1 = 10%. The market value of the <br/>offer is the market value of the mortgage plus the cash down payment.  <br/> <br/>Press Display <br/>10 &#61568; NOM%  10 <br/>1 &#61568; P/YR 1 <br/>&#61568; EFF% 10 <br/>12 &#61568; P/YR 12 <br/>&#61568; NOM%  9.568969 <br/>36 N 36 <br/>3994 +/&#61473; PMT &#61473;3,994 <br/>433709.14 +/&#61473; FV &#61473;433,709.14  <br/>PV 450,410.811187 (market value of the mortgage) <br/>+ 240000 =  690,410.811187 (market value of the offer) <br/> <br/>The market value of the offer is $690,410.81. <br/></p>
<p>Question 956 <br/>Answer: 4 <br/>Option (4) is correct because a landlord must provide written, not oral, notice at least three months in advance <br/>in order to increase rent. Option (1) is incorrect because a residential tenant can assign or sublet the leased <br/>premises at any time during the term of the tenancy with the consent of the landlord. Option (2) is incorrect <br/>because if a tenant has failed to give the security deposit required under the agreement within 30 days of the <br/>date it is required, the landlord is entitled to terminate the tenancy for cause by giving not less than one month <br/>written notice. Option (3) is incorrect because a landlord can enter residential premises if an emergency exists <br/>and the entry is necessary to protect life or property.  <br/></p>
<p>Question 957 <br/>Answer: 2 <br/>Option (2) is correct because licensees are not required to include the name of their related brokerage in each <br/>&#8220;Tweet&#8221;. Option (1) is incorrect because the name of the brokerage must appear in a prominent and easily <br/>readable form on all internet and social media advertising vehicles, including each individual page. Option (3) <br/>is incorrect because claims such as &#8220;Top Selling Real Estate Team!&#8221; must include a qualifying statement. Option <br/>(4) is incorrect because if a licensee posts a video blog on YouTube, the name of the brokerage must be in the <br/>title or description of the video.  <br/></p>
<p>Question 958 <br/>Answer: 1 <br/>Option (1) is correct because specific performance can be granted for a contract for the sale of property, but only <br/>if there is evidence that the subject property is unique. Options (2), (3), and (4) are incorrect because these are all <br/>true statements regarding specific performance.  </p>


<p>Question 959 <br/>Answer: 3 <br/>The cap rate used to calculate the market value of the subject property is the one that most reflects the subject <br/>property and is determined by several factors. For the purposes of this question, the two most comparable <br/>properties have been selected and a range of values is determined. <br/>Find the cap rate: <br/></p>
<p>NOICap Rate =<br/>Sale Price<br/></p>
<p>  <br/></p>
<p>Comparable A <br/>NOI = $51,000 &#61473; $32,000 &#61473; $4,080 = $14,920 <br/>Cap Rate = $14,920 &#247; $234,000 = 0.0637607 <br/></p>
<p>Comparable B <br/>NOI = $44,000 &#61473; $28,000 &#61473; $3,520 = $12,480 <br/>Cap Rate = $12,480 &#247; $211,000 = 0.0591469 <br/></p>
<p>Subject Property <br/>NOI = $48,000 &#61473; $30,000 &#61473; $3,840 = $14,160 <br/></p>
<p>Sale price using cap rate from Comparable A:  <br/>NOISale Price =<br/></p>
<p>Cap Rate<br/> <br/></p>
<p> = $14,160 &#247; 0.0637607 = $222,080 or $222,000 (rounded) <br/>Sale price using cap rate from Comparable B: <br/></p>
<p>NOISale Price =<br/>Cap Rate<br/></p>
<p> <br/></p>
<p>  = $14,160 &#247; 0.0591469 = $239,404 or $239,000 (rounded) <br/>Therefore, the best market value estimate would be $222,000 to $239,000 (rounded to the nearest $1,000). <br/></p>
<p>Question 960 <br/>Answer: 1 <br/>Option (1) is correct and Options (2), (3), and (4) are incorrect because yields and market values are inversely <br/>related. If market capitalization rates (i.e., the required yields) decline while net operating income remains <br/>constant, market values will rise. <br/></p>
<p>Question 961 <br/>Answer: 3 <br/>Option (3) is correct because the registration of a charge only raises a rebuttable presumption that the charge is <br/>valid. Unlike a registered fee simple, a registered charge is not &#8220;guaranteed&#8221;. Option (1) is incorrect because the <br/>registration of a mortgage transfers the mortgagor&#8217;s interest in land to the mortgagee as security for the <br/>repayment of the debt. Option (2) is incorrect because even if a mortgage is not registered in the land title office, <br/>it is still enforceable as between the parties to the mortgage. Option (4) is incorrect because Option (3) is correct.  </p>


<p>Question 962 <br/>Answer: 1  <br/>Option (1) is correct because a conflict of interest arises when there is a substantial risk that the agent&#8217;s <br/>representation of a client would be negatively affected by the agent&#8217;s own interest or by the agent&#8217;s duties to <br/>another. Option (2) is incorrect because some conflicts of interest can be avoided. Option (3) is incorrect because <br/>conflicts of interest can be documented or undocumented. Option (4) is incorrect because a trivial risk to a <br/>client does not create a conflict of interest by itself &#8211; the risk can be something that is more than trivial. <br/></p>
<p>Question 963 <br/>Answer: 2 <br/>Option (2) is correct because movable objects such as furniture are not normally included in the concept of real <br/>property, but instead are considered personal property. Options (1), (3), and (4) are incorrect because these are <br/>normally classified as real property.  <br/></p>
<p>Question 964 <br/>Answer: 1 <br/>Option (1) is correct because strata corporations are created so that property can be subdivided into separate <br/>parts for private ownership. The sole purpose is not to limit the liability of the corporation members. Options <br/>(2), (3), and (4) are incorrect because these are true statements relating to strata lot ownership.  <br/></p>
<p>Question 965 <br/>Answer: 1 <br/>Option (1) is correct (false) because there is no single statute law governing the real property tax system in BC. <br/>The Assessment Act is one of the sources of property law, but not the only source. Option (2) is incorrect (true) <br/>since Helen, as the registered owner, is no longer living in the Vancouver property, she is not eligible for the <br/>basic home owner grant. Option (3) is incorrect (true); if a property has been incorrectly assessed, anyone, <br/>including a municipal council, can file an appeal to the Property Assessment Review Panels under the <br/>Assessment Act. Option (4) is incorrect (true); Helen is qualified for a special assessment on her property <br/>because she has lived continuously in that home for more than 10 years, and the property was zoned for a <br/>higher use. <br/> </p>

<p>Question 967 <br/>Answer: 4 <br/>Option (4) is correct because none of the other statements are true. Option (1) is incorrect because the interests <br/>of the agent do not take priority over those of the principal. Option (2) is incorrect because the agent&#8217;s primary <br/>duty is to their principal, who may or may not be the buyer of the property. Option (3) is incorrect because the <br/>agent is not an employee of their principal.  <br/></p>
<p>Question 968 <br/>Answer: 4 <br/>Option (4) is correct because it is true. Option (1) is incorrect because changing any physical characteristic of a <br/>property such that it results in a misrepresentation is not acceptable. Option (2) is incorrect because photo <br/>editing is allowed as long as it does not misrepresent aspects of the property. Option (3) is incorrect because <br/>removing power lines with photo editing is considered changing a physical characteristic of the property and <br/>represents a misrepresentation, which is unacceptable. <br/></p>
<p>Question 969 <br/>Answer: 4 <br/>Option (4) is correct because section 10 of the Interest Act does not require that the lender be a financial <br/>institution in order for the borrower to have the right to tender prepayment of their mortgage. Options (1), (2), <br/>and (3) are incorrect because these are all requirements under section 10 of the Interest Act in order for a <br/>borrower to tender prepayment.  <br/></p>
<p>Question 970 <br/>Answer: 2 <br/>Final Cost &#8722; Salvage Value = Remaining Value <br/>$17,100 &#8722; $1,500 = $15,600 <br/>$15,600 &#247; 10 = $1,560 per year depreciation <br/></p>
<p>Question 971 <br/>Answer: 3  <br/>Option (3) is correct because section 46 of the Residential Tenancy Act provides that a landlord can give a notice <br/>of the end of the tenancy agreement to a tenant who does not pay the rent when it is due, which is cancelled if <br/>the tenant pays the rent owing within 5 days of receiving the notice. Option (1) is incorrect because section 26 of <br/>the Residential Tenancy Act abolishes the remedy of distress (seizing a tenant&#8217;s goods and eventually selling <br/>them to satisfy a claim for rent owing) in residential tenancies. Option (2) is incorrect because non-payment of <br/>rent allows a landlord to terminate a fixed term tenancy agreement. Option (4) is incorrect because failure to <br/>pay rent does not make the tenancy agreement void.  <br/></p>
<p>Question 972 <br/>Answer: 3  <br/>Option (3) is correct because an implied easement may result if the intention of the parties granting the <br/>easement has not been sufficiently explicit. Option (1) is incorrect because the land receiving the benefit is <br/>called the dominant tenement. Option (2) is incorrect because the dominant tenement owner does not receive <br/>an ownership of the easement area, but rather has an interest in the land less than ownership. Option (4) is <br/>incorrect because an easement can only be granted by the owner of the servient tenement, not by a tenant who <br/>occupies the land under a lease.  </p>


<p>Question 973 <br/>Answer: 3 <br/>Option (3) is the correct answer. A &amp; A Appraisers will be responsible to Peach Credit Union under contract law, <br/>and will be responsible to Joan under tort law. The appraisal contract is between A &amp; A and Peachy Credit <br/>Union, and an implied term in the contract is the appraisal report be carefully prepared according to accepted <br/>appraisal practices. Due to the unacceptable error, it is clear that this contract has been breached by A &amp; A. <br/>There is no contract between A &amp; A and Joan, but it is reasonable that Joan may rely on this appraisal report. <br/>Given the unacceptable error, A &amp; A may be liable to Joan for the tort of negligence. Options (1), (2), and (4) are <br/>therefore incorrect. <br/></p>
<p>Question 974 <br/>Answer: 2 <br/>Option (2) is correct because there are no legal restrictions regarding security deposits, so this is an item left <br/>open for negotiation. Option (1) is incorrect because it is up for negotiation who is entitled to the interest which <br/>accrues on a security deposit. Option (3) is incorrect because the federal Interest Act does not restrict the interest <br/>rate on a security deposit. Option (4) is incorrect because there are no legal restrictions regarding security <br/>deposits for commercial tenancies.  <br/></p>
<p>Question 975 <br/>Answer: 4 <br/>Option (4) is correct because licensees are not required to provide opinions to buyers on areas outside of their <br/>expertise. Option (1) is incorrect because a disclosure statement will not protect licensees from all <br/>misrepresentations. Option (2) is incorrect because a licensee can be liable for the tort of fraudulent <br/>misrepresentation even if he or she does not have expertise in that area. Option (3) is incorrect because <br/>vicarious liability does not arise between the licensee and the vendor. <br/></p>
<p>Question 976  <br/>Answer: 4 <br/>Option (4) is correct because if a seller instructs a listing licensee not to disclose a material latent defect to a <br/>potential buyer of the property, the licensee must refuse to provide further trading services to or on behalf of <br/>that client in respect of the trade in real estate. Option (1) is incorrect because as an agent, the listing licensee <br/>owes a duty to follow his or her principal&#8217;s instructions. The listing licensee must therefore discontinue acting <br/>for the principal, rather than disregard the principal&#8217;s instructions. Option (2) is incorrect because the British <br/>Columbia Financial Services Authority governs licensees&#8217; conduct; it does not govern consumers&#8217; conduct. <br/>Option (3) is incorrect because the listing licensee cannot act upon instructions that would result in a <br/>misrepresentation of the property or in a violation of federal, provincial, or local law. </p>

Therefore, the lender is being slightly underpaid with each payment. Given the inverse <br/>relationship between interest rates and present value, if the present value rises, then the interest rate drops. <br/></p>
<p>Question 978 <br/>Answer: 2 <br/>Option (2) is correct and Options (1), (3), and (4) are incorrect because stare decisis literally means &#8220;let the <br/>former decision stand&#8221;, which requires courts to adhere to principles laid down by previous courts where the <br/>facts are substantially the same.  <br/></p>
<p>Question 979 <br/>Answer: 1 <br/>Option (1) is correct because although section 49 of the Real Estate Services Rules places limitations on when <br/>licensees can make promises to purchase property to induce a buyer to enter a contract, Tina complied with <br/>these limitations because she provided all the terms of the promise in writing to Tom before he entered into the <br/>contract of purchase and sale. Option (2) is incorrect because Tina did not breach the Real Estate Services Act. <br/>Option (3) is incorrect because Tina did not engage in misconduct and is not liable to be disciplined by the <br/>British Columbia Financial Services Authority. Option (4) is incorrect because neither Options (2) nor (3) are <br/>correct.  <br/></p>
<p>Question 980 <br/>Answer: 4 <br/>Option (4) is correct because registered charges are not indefeasible, but rather only raise a rebuttable <br/>presumption that the charge is valid. An innocent purchaser of any interest less than a fee simple estate in land <br/>may not rely on the land title system as being conclusive proof of ownership. Option (1) is incorrect because <br/>registered charges are not indefeasible. Option (2) is incorrect because Julia is able to have the mortgage <br/>removed from her title, and so is not obliged to repay the mortgage or recover from the assurance fund. Option <br/>(3) is incorrect because Handy Dandy is not entitled to recover the amount of the mortgage from the assurance <br/>fund because courts have found that the cost of fraud should not be borne by the public but should instead be <br/>the responsibility of the lenders themselves.  <br/></p>
<p>Question 981 <br/>Answer: 2 <br/>Option (2) is correct because real estate is affected by externalities due to the immobility of land. This <br/>immobility means that home owners cannot simply move their property away from negative externalities and <br/>cannot move their property towards positive externalities. Options (1), (3), and (4) are incorrect because they are <br/>not causes of neighbouring properties&#8217; external influences on real property.   </p>

<p>Question 983 <br/>Answer: 4 <br/>Option (4) is correct because a license is not one of the three main classifications of interests in land that are less <br/>than estates. Options (1), (2), and (3) are incorrect because these are the three main classifications of interests in <br/>land that are less than estates.  <br/></p>

<p>Question 985 <br/>Answer: 1  <br/>Option (1) is false since a restrictive covenant must be a negative obligation; however, it does not matter <br/>whether the wording is positive or negative. Options (2), (3), and (4) are incorrect because they are true. <br/></p>
<p>Question 986 <br/>Answer: 4 <br/>Option (4) is correct because Options (1), (2), and (3) are all required to be disclosed by licensees in this situation <br/>due to the operation of section 53 of the Real Estate Services Rules.  <br/></p>
<p>Question 987 <br/>Answer: 3 <br/>Option (3) is correct because the plaintiff does not have to prove an interference with the use and enjoyment of <br/>their land and physical damage to property to bring a successful claim for trespass. Options (1), (2), and (4) are <br/>incorrect because these are all true statements. <br/></p>
<p>Question 988 <br/>Answer: 1  <br/>The maximum loan granted will be the lower amount of the loan-to-value constraint and the DCR constraint. <br/> <br/>Using DCR constraint, calculate maximum allowable payments.  <br/> <br/></p>

<p>Question 989 <br/>Answer: 1 <br/>Option (1) is correct because the plant was conforming to the bylaw prior to the rezoning, and so it will be <br/>&#8220;grandfathered&#8221; as a legal non-conforming use. Option (2) is incorrect because a non-conforming use may <br/>continue through successive changes of ownership. Option (3) is incorrect because the Local Government Act, <br/>not the Planning Act, establishes the circumstances under which non-conforming uses may continue. Option <br/>(4) is incorrect because land use contracts can no longer be created; rather, the use could continue as a legal <br/>non-conforming use or the property owner could apply to have the area rezoned.  <br/></p>
<p>Question 990 <br/>Answer: 3 <br/>Option (3) is correct because occupiers are entitled to assume that a visitor will exercise reasonable care for <br/>their own safety. Because Eugene breached this duty, he will probably not recover any damages against <br/>Rodney. Option (1) is incorrect because Rodney is likely not liable to Eugene for his injuries. Option (2) is <br/>incorrect because Lenore&#8217;s injury from tripping on the garden hose was a direct result of Rodney&#8217;s negligence, <br/>and she did not willingly assume these risks, so Rodney will likely be liable for her injuries. Option (4) is <br/>incorrect because Rodney is still an occupier of the premises even if he is not physically present when the <br/>injuries in question occurred. <br/></p>
<p>Question 991 <br/>Answer: 2 <br/>Option (2) is correct because the Occupiers Liability Act requires an occupier of premises to take care that is <br/>reasonable in all of the circumstances to ensure that a person will be reasonably safe in using the premises. If <br/>Ethan was a child, it is likely that it would be found reasonable that he could not have read the sign, and so the <br/>occupier would have been required to do more to ensure he was reasonably safe. Option (1) is incorrect, <br/>because a visitor is deemed to have willingly assumed all risks only if trespassing while also committing or <br/>having the intention to commit a criminal act. Even if a person has willingly assumed all risks, an occupier still <br/>has a duty not to create a danger with intent to do harm to the person, or act with reckless disregard to the <br/>safety of the person. Option (3) is incorrect because the Occupiers Liability Act provides that an occupier is <br/>liable, and if Clara was leasing the lot, she could still be an occupier under the Act if she was in physical <br/>possession of the premises, or had responsibility for, and control over, the condition of the premises, the <br/>activities conducted on those premises, and the persons allowed to enter those premises. Option (4) is incorrect <br/>because as long as Clara is deemed an occupier under the Act, then she would be liable even if she was away <br/>from the lot at the time of the injury.  <br/></p>
<p>Question 992 <br/>Answer: 3 <br/>Option (3) is correct and Options (1), (2), and (4) are incorrect because filing a notice of civil claim is the first step <br/>to in bringing a claim. <br/></p>
<p>Question 993 <br/>Answer: 2 <br/>Option (2) is correct because the parcel identifier (PID) is listed under the &#8220;Description of Land&#8221; section of a title <br/>search. Options (1), (3) and (4) are incorrect because these items are not listed on a title search.  <br/></p>
<p>Question 994 <br/>Answer: 2 <br/>Option (2) is correct because the immobile nature of land causes real property to be more influenced by <br/>externalities. Options (1), (3), and (4) are incorrect as they do not describe externalities resulting from land&#8217;s <br/>immobility.  </p>


<p>Question 995 <br/>Answer: 4 <br/>In this question, straight-line means that each year the expense will be the same. We ignore CCA.  <br/> <br/></p>
<p>$97,635 &#247; 25 years = $3,905.40 <br/></p>
<p>Question 996 <br/>Answer: 2 <br/>Option (2) is correct because items that are fixtures are considered part of the land and will belong to the buyer <br/>upon completion. Therefore, a seller of real property does not have the right to detach and remove any fixture <br/>after entering the contract of purchase and sale. Option (1) is incorrect because an object &#8220;prima facie&#8221; is <br/>considered a fixture once it is even slightly attached to real property, unless it is shown that it was intended to <br/>remain a chattel. Option (3) is incorrect because if an object is attached to the real property for the better use of <br/>the mirror, the owner will usually be entitled to remove the object (as it is considered a chattel) when the house <br/>is sold. Option (4) is incorrect because if an object cannot be removed without damaging the real property, then <br/>this is an indication that it is likely to be considered a fixture.  <br/></p>
<p>Question 997 <br/>Answer: 2 <br/>Option (2) is correct. Choosing debt financing instead of equity financing will not change the predictability of <br/>return on capital. Options (1), (3), and (4) are incorrect because they are valid reasons to choose debt financing <br/>over equity financing.  <br/></p>
<p>Question 998 <br/>Answer: 3 <br/>Option (3) is correct because agency/fiduciary law is  an example of a common law source of duties to clients. <br/>Options (1), (2), and (4) are incorrect because they are examples of legislative duties to clients. <br/></p>
<p>Question 999 <br/>Answer: 2 <br/>Option (2) is correct because Dave is not trespassing while committing or intending to commit a criminal act (as <br/>he was merely looking for casual work). Dave also does not fall under any of the other enumerated categories of <br/>visitors who are deemed to have willingly assumed all the risks of entering on a property under section 3 of the <br/>Occupiers Liability Act. Option (1) is incorrect because Mimi is an occupier since she is in &#8220;physical possession <br/>of the premises&#8221;, and the absent owners remain occupiers because they still have &#8220;responsibility for, and <br/>control over&#8221; the property. (There may be more than one occupier of the same premises as per section 1 of the <br/>Occupiers Liability Act.) Option (3) is incorrect because section 3(2) of the Occupiers Liability Act states that the <br/>duty of care imposed on occupiers applies in relation to the: (a) condition of the premises; (b) activities on the <br/>premises; or (c) conduct of third parties on the premises. Option (4) is incorrect because the duty of care <br/>imposed by the Occupiers Liability Act on an occupier is to take such care as in all the circumstances is <br/>reasonable to see that persons coming onto the property will be reasonably safe. </p>
