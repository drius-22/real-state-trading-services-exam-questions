"Question 501: What is a “time clause” or “72 hour clause”? 
(1)It refers to the fact that the offer is only open for a stipulated time. 
(2)It refers to the period in which either the seller or buyer can change their mind. 
(3)It refers to the length of time that a condition subsequent is in force. 
(4)It refers to the length of time the other party has to remove a condition precedent once the clause is invoked.","Answer: 4 Explanation: Option (4) is correct because a “time clause” or “72 hour clause” is a clause contained in a contract for purchase or resale of land which allows a seller to invoke a time period in which a condition precedent must be removed. If invoked, failure to remove the condition precedent within the time period would result in termination of the contract. Option (1) is incorrect because a time clause does not, in and of itself, mean that the offer is only open for a stipulated time period. Rather, the right to invoke a time clause arises only where a seller receives a subsequent offer after entering the original contract of purchase and sale. Option (2) is incorrect because this is a right given to the seller only. Option (3) is incorrect because time clauses relate to conditions precedent, not conditions subsequent."
"Question 502: Which of the following statements regarding trespass is TRUE? 
(1)Trespass is actionable only upon proof of damage. 
(2)Trespass is actionable per se. 
(3)Trespass is not actionable. 
(4)Trespass is actionable only within 30 days of the trespass.","Answer: 2 Explanation: Option (2) is correct because trespass is actionable per se, meaning that no actual damage needs to be proven in order for an occupier to sue in trespass. Option (1) is incorrect for the same reason. Option (3) is incorrect because trespass is actionable. Option (4) is incorrect because there is no 30 day limit for bringing an action in trespass."
"Question 503: The market value of a vacant site can be determined using: 
(1)the cost approach of appraisal. 
(2)the comparative approach of appraisal. 
(3)the accrual approach of appraisal. 
(4)the capitalization approach of appraisal.","Answer: 2 Explanation: Option (2) is correct because a vacant site can only be valued using the comparative approach of appraisal. Options (1), (3), and (4) are therefore incorrect."

"Question 505: A “real estate service” under the Real Estate Services Act includes: 
(1)finding a party to acquire real estate. 
(2)collecting rents or security deposits for the use of real estate. 
(3)advising on the appropriate price for real estate. 
(4)all of the above.",Answer: 4 Explanation: Option (4) is correct because “real estate services” is defined in the Real Estate Services Act to include: (a) rental property management services; (b) strata management services; and (c) trading services. Finding a party to acquire real estate and advising on the appropriate price for real estate are both “trading services” under the Real Estate Services Act. Collecting rents or security deposits for the use of real estate is a “rental property management service” according to the Real Estate Services Act.

"Question 507: Mr. Smith has contracted to sell his house to Mr. Jones for $200,000. Mr. Jones has paid a deposit of $15,000, the balance in cash. Conveyancing fees are $350, taxes were prepaid by the seller, totalling $800 net for the period of July 1 to December 31, and the commission is 5%. Completion, adjustment, and possession dates are July 1. As well, Mr. Jones is NOT a foreign entity for property transfer tax purposes. Property transfer tax will be due on completion.

"Question 508: Which of the following would be classified as a current asset on the financial statements of a business? 
(1)Land 
(2)Rents receivable 
(3)Real property at its historic cost 
(4)Accounts payable","Answer: 2 Explanation: Option (2) is correct because rents receivable is the only account listed that will be classified as a current asset. A current asset is something that the company owns, that will be used up within the next year. The rent receivable account is expected to be collected within the next year. Options (1) and (3) are incorrect because land and real property are classified as fixed- or long-term assets. Option (4) is incorrect because accounts payable is classified as a current liability."
"Question 509: Bobby Buyer purchased a home in an area with landslide risks; however, at the time of purchase, Bobby’s licensee did not make any inquiries about landslide risks in the area. Three months after Bobby’s purchase, a landslide occurred three lots away from his property. There is no physical damage to Bobby’s property, but the value of the property decreased significantly. Upon a brief investigation, Bobby discovered that his neighbouring property had previously been the subject of a landslide and that there were public government reports about it. Bobby has started a claim in negligence for economic loss against his licensee for not investigating and alerting him of any landslide risks. Which of the following statements is TRUE? 
(1)Bobby will have difficulty proving that his licensee owed him a duty of care because it is not reasonably foreseeable that his licensee’s actions in the course of the sale would affect Bobby. 
(2)When assessing the standard of care, a court will need to determine whether a reasonable buyer’s agent would have made inquiries as to the landslide risk relating to the property. 
(3)Since the law of negligence only provides for compensation for physical damages, Bobby will not succeed in a negligence claim against his agent. 
(4)All of the above statements are true.","Answer: 2 Explanation: Option (2) is correct because the standard of care expected of a licensee is based on what a reasonable licensee ought to have done in all the circumstances. In this situation, a reasonable buyer’s agent would have made inquiries as to the landslide risk relating to the property given that the area was publicly known for landslide risks. Option (1) is incorrect because it is reasonably foreseeable that the actions or inactions of licensees will affect their clients. Option (3) is incorrect because negligence law may also provide compensation for non-physical damages such as economic losses. Option (4) is incorrect because Options (1) and (3) are incorrect."
"Question 510: An option to purchase the mortgaged property given by the mortgagor to the mortgagee at the time the mortgage is negotiated is: 
(1)enforceable if the mortgagor has independent legal advice. 
(2)void. 
(3)enforceable in all cases. 
(4)called the equity of redemption.","Answer: 2 Explanation: Option (2) is correct because there is a fundamental principle of mortgage law which prohibits “clogging” on “the equity of redemption”. The equity of redemption refers to a borrower’s right to repay the mortgage and, upon doing so, to redeem his or her legal title to the property free of all encumbrances. In other words, a borrower (or the mortgagor) cannot be prevented by the terms of the mortgage from eventually redeeming his or her property free from the conditions contained in the mortgage. An option to purchase a mortgaged property given by the mortgagor (the borrower) to the mortgagee (the lender) at the time the mortgage is negotiated, if exercised, would prevent the mortgagor from redeeming his or her property upon repayment, and is therefore void. Option (1) is incorrect because the prohibition against clogging does not disappear even where the mortgagor has independent legal advice. Option (3) is incorrect because a void option cannot be enforceable in any case. Option (4) is incorrect because the equity of redemption refers to a mortgagor’s right to repay the mortgage, and is not a term for an option to repurchase a mortgaged property."
"Question 511: All other things being equal, shortening the contractual term on a constant level payment mortgage always has the effect of: 
(1)increasing the size of the periodic payments required to fully amortize the loan. 
(2)increasing the size of the outstanding balance payment due at the end of the term. 
(3)increasing the interest rate. 
(4)increasing the payment frequency.","Answer: 2 Explanation: Option (2) is correct because if the term of a constant level payment mortgage is shortened, the result will be a higher outstanding balance at the end of the term. This occurs because a shorter term has fewer payments that will pay down principal and reduce the outstanding balance with each payment. Option (1) is incorrect because the size of periodic payments is not increased when the contractual term in shortened in a constant level payment mortgage. Option (3) is incorrect because the interest rate is not affected. Option (4) is incorrect because the payment frequency will not change."
"Question 512: If you consider that the value shown on your assessment notice is too high, you can make a formal complaint to the: 
(1)municipal court. 
(2)Court of Appeal. 
(3)assessment commissioner. 
(4)Property Assessment Review Panel.","Answer: 4 Explanation: Option (4) is correct because any person may, under the Assessment Act, make a complaint against an entry in an assessment roll on the grounds that the property has been valued at too high or too low an amount. Any initial appeal against a real property assessment must be submitted to the Property Assessment Review Panel for initial adjudication. Option (1) is incorrect because there are no “municipal courts” to deal with property assessment complaints. Option (2) is incorrect because the Court of Appeal will not hear formal complaints regarding assessment notices. The Court of Appeal will only review issues of law arising from lower court decisions. Option (3) is incorrect because, while the Property Assessment Appeal Board may order the Assessment Commissioner to carry out a reassessment, formal complaints are not made to the Commissioner."
"Question 513: Charlie enters into a fixed term tenancy agreement with Lucy for the rental of a suite during the school year. The agreement is for eight months beginning on September 1, 2018. The agreement does not provide that Charlie must vacate the rental unit when the term expires. In April, Charlie finds a summer job and decides to remain in the suite after the original lease expires. He pays Lucy one month’s rent on May 1, 2019, which she accepts. No new agreement is entered into. Two days later, Lucy learns that her brother, Linus, has been transferred back to Vancouver and is expected to arrive at the end of the month with his new wife, Sally. Linus has indicated that he wishes to live in the suite now occupied by Charlie. Which of the following statements is TRUE? 
(1)Under the termination provisions of the Residential Tenancy Act, Lucy can give Charlie notice of the end of the tenancy agreement since she intends, in good faith, for her brother to occupy the premises. 
(2)Lucy just has to wait until the end of May, and can evict Charlie at any time after that, since the original fixed term lease has expired and there is no new tenancy agreement. 
(3)If Linus decides to purchase the suite, and Lucy provides Charlie with at least two months’ notice and pays an amount equivalent to one months’ rent, Linus must move in within a reasonable time after the effective date of the notice and stay for at least 6 months or else a court may order that Charlie be paid an amount equivalent to 12 months’ rent. 
(4)If Linus decides to purchase the suite and plans to move in right away, Lucy can give at least one month notice to end the tenancy.","Answer: 3 Explanation: Option (3) is correct because under the Residential Tenancy Act, when a fixed term residential tenancy expires and the agreement does not provide that the tenant will vacate the rental unit when the term expires, the landlord and the tenant are presumed to have renewed the original agreement as a month-to-month tenancy. Section 49 of the Residential Tenancy Act allows a landlord to terminate a tenancy agreement where the landlord enters into a good faith agreement to sell the rental unit and the purchaser intends to occupy that unit, provided that each of the conditions laid out in Option (3) are met. If the purchaser does not occupy the unit as intended for at least six months, the purchaser must pay the tenant an amount equivalent to 12 months’ rent. Option (1) is incorrect because a landlord cannot terminate a tenancy agreement to allow his or her sibling to occupy the rental unit without further justification. There is a provision for a “close family member” but siblings do not fall under that category. Option (2) is incorrect because, as previously mentioned, Lucy and Linus are presumed to have renewed the original agreement as a month-to-month tenancy. In order to end the tenancy, Lucy must be able to rely on a provision in the Residential Tenancy Act which allows her to do so. Unfortunately, in Lucy’s situation, Charlie is her brother and not a “close family member”. Even if Charlie was a “close family member”, Lucy would need to provide two months’ notice. Option (4) is incorrect because Lucy would need to provide at least two months’ notice to end the tenancy."
"Question 514: When can an appeal be made to the Supreme Court of British Columbia regarding a real property assessment value? 
(1)When a property owner receives their assessment notice 
(2)After receipt of the Property Assessment Appeal Board decision, and then only on a point of law 
(3)Never 
(4)After receiving notification of the decision of the Property Assessment Review Panel","Answer: 2 Explanation: Option (2) is correct because an appeal against a real property assessment must be submitted to the Property Assessment Panel for initial adjudication. Subsequently, an appeal may be made to the Property Assessment Appeal Board. An appeal can then be made from the Property Assessment Appeal Board to the Supreme Court of British Columbia, only if it is based on a point of law. Option (1) is incorrect because an appeal must first be submitted to the Property Assessment Panel. Option (3) is incorrect because an appeal may reach the Supreme Court of British Columbia. Option (4) is incorrect because an appeal following a decision of the Property Assessment Review Panel must first be submitted to the Property Assessment Appeal Board."
"Question 515: If an offer is made by mail and the acceptance is mailed, when is the acceptance effective? 
(1)When it is received by the offeree 
(2)When it is received by the offeror 
(3)When it is posted 
(4)From the date and time of the postmark on the envelope","Answer: 3 Explanation: Option (3) is correct because the “postal acceptance rule” provides that where an offer is made by mail, or other non-instantaneous means, acceptance is effective when it is posted. Option (1) is incorrect because the offeree is the party accepting the offer. Option (2) is incorrect because, if an offer is made by mail, acceptance need not be received by the offeror to be effective. Option (4) is incorrect because, in some cases, a document may not be postmarked the very day it is posted."
"Question 516: Where a borrower believes that the amount of interest being charged is excessive, under which statute might relief be granted? 
(1)The Interest Act 
(2)The Business Practices and Consumer Protection Act 
(3)The Land Titles Act 
(4)All of the above","Answer: 2 Explanation: Option (2) is correct because, in British Columbia, the Business Practices and Consumer Protection Act gives courts the power to grant relief where a mortgage transaction is deemed inequitable, or where the cost of a loan is excessive and the transaction is harsh and unconscionable. Option (1) in incorrect because the federal Interest Act does not impose a limit on the rate of interest which can be charged in a mortgage transaction. Option (3) is incorrect because the Land Title Act does not provide for relief for excessive mortgage interest rates. Option (4) is incorrect because Options (1) and (3) are incorrect."
"Question 517: The Annual Percentage Rate (APR) is: 
(1)a requirement under the federal Interest Act. 
(2)also known as the stated interest rate. 
(3)the borrower’s contractual interest rate plus any non-interest finance charges. 
(4)an interest rate that must be expressed with semi-annual compounding.","Answer: 3 Explanation: Option (3) is correct because the APR is the borrower’s contractual interest rate plus any non-interest financing charges such as and bonuses or fees. Option (1) is incorrect because the APR is not a requirement under the Federal Interest Act. Option (2) is incorrect because the APR includes non-interest financing charges, and thus may differ from the stated interest rate. Option (4) is incorrect because the APR is not expressed with semi-annual compounding."
"Question 518: Which one of the following lists accurately describes the correct criteria, as agreed upon by negotiation experts, for a successful negotiation? 
(1)Efficiency, a zero-sum game, minimal wasted resources, preservation of the relationship 
(2)Efficiency, satisfaction of both parties, distributive results, minimal wasted resources 
(3)Efficiency, satisfaction of both parties, minimal wasted resources, preservation of the relationship 
(4)Efficiency, a zero-sum game, satisfaction of both parties, preservation of the relationship","Answer: 3 Explanation: Option (3) is correct because these criteria characterize successful negotiations which are most likely to render optimal outcomes for both parties. Options (1) and (4) are incorrect because negotiation need not be a zero-sum game where the only solution is a compromise down the middle. Option (2) is incorrect because a “distributive perspective”, viewing negotiation as a conflict with one winner and one loser, can inhibit creative problem solving and makes it difficult to reach optimal results."
"Question 519: As a marketing incentive to speed up the sale of newly completed but unsold condominiums, a developer agrees to provide the buyers with first mortgages written at 8% rather than the going market rate of 13%, if they pay the $45,000 asking price. Under these circumstances, the developer would likely be equally satisfied (in cash equivalent terms) with an “all cash” offer: 
(1)less than $45,000. 
(2)more than $45,000. 
(3)equal to $45,000. 
(4)that includes an additional bonus in order to purchase the unit.","Answer: 1 Explanation: Option (1) is correct. Since the market rate is higher than the contract rate, the market value of the mortgage is less than the face value of $45,000. The cash-equivalent value of the mortgage at 8% will be less than a $45,000 mortgage at 13%. Options (2), (3), and (4) are therefore incorrect."
"Question 520: Garfield, a licensee, was representing a seller, Madison, in the sale of his house to Tyler. After the sale completed, Tyler discovered that the main and lower floors of the house sloped. Garfield, Madison, and Tyler had not noticed this before, although the defect was discoverable using ordinary diligence. Based on the above, which of the following statements is TRUE? 
(1)Garfield had a duty to inspect the premises for soundness and structural defects before advertising it for sale. 
(2)The sloping floor is a patent defect that should have been brought to Tyler’s attention. 
(3)Neither Garfield nor Madison are liable to Tyler for failing to bring the defect to Tyler’s attention. 
(4)Both (1) and (2) are true statements.","Answer: 3 Explanation: Option (3) is correct because the sloped floors were a defect that could have been discovered during the course of a reasonable inspection. Therefore, the sloped floors were a patent defect. The general rule regarding patent defects is that the buyer assumes the risk (caveat emptor), meaning that the seller and the listing licensee are not required to disclose discoverable defects. Option (1) is incorrect because, while it can be prudent to do so, neither the seller nor the seller’s agent has a duty to inspect the premises prior to advertising it for sale. Option (2) is incorrect because a vendor is not required to disclose patent defects. Option (4) is incorrect because Options (1) and (2) are both incorrect."
"Question 521: Which of the following is considered to be an advantage of the mobile office environment? 
(1)It is easier to establish a sense of community within the brokerage in a mobile office environment. 
(2)The mobile office environment reduces certain inefficiencies, such as commuting, allowing licensees to focus their time on more productive tasks. 
(3)The mobile environment makes it easier for a licensee to feel connected to the brokerage, strengthening the sense of loyalty. 
(4)All of the above","Answer: 2 Explanation: Option (2) is correct because the mobile office environment permits representatives to work from home, out in the field, or from other locations that the traditional offices. An advantage of this is that it eliminates certain inefficiencies, such as time spent commuting to and from the office, which allows representatives more time to focus on more productive, income-generating tasks. Option (1) is incorrect because due to decentralization, it is more difficult, not easier, to establish a sense of community within the brokerage in a mobile office environment. Option (3) is incorrect because representatives may feel disconnected from the brokerage when they are less physically present, resulting in a weaker sense of loyalty. Since Options (1) and (3) are incorrect, Option (4) is also incorrect."
"Question 522: The principle of good faith includes: 
(1)the duty of parties to a contract to fulfil their contractual obligations to the best of their ability. 
(2)the duty of a mortgagee not to commence foreclosure proceedings without giving the mortgagor ample time to cure the default. 
(3)the duty to not make false representations when negotiating a contract. 
(4)the duty of parties to a contract to act honestly in the performance of their contractual obligations.","Answer: 4 Explanation: Option (4) is correct because the principle of good faith includes the duty of honest performance, where parties to a contract are under a duty to act honestly in the performance of their contractual obligations. Options (1), (2), and (3) are incorrect because these are not duties included in the general organizing principle of good faith."
"Question 523: Which one of the following accurately describes the law with respect to security deposits on a commercial tenancy? 
(1)Security deposits must not exceed 50% of the monthly rental. 
(2)There is no limit on the amount of security deposit that may be charged. 
(3)Security deposits are not permitted. 
(4)Security deposits cannot exceed one month’s rent.","Answer: 2 Explanation: Option (2) is correct because, as far as commercial tenancies are concerned, there are no legal restrictions regarding security deposits. Options (1), (3), and (4) are incorrect for the same reason."
"Question 524: A trading services licensee who is not licensed to provide property management services CAN: 
(1)collect rent from tenants. 
(2)supervise contractors hired by the owner. 
(3)negotiate a lease document. 
(4)negotiate contractors on the owner's behalf other than the lease.",Answer: 3 Explanation: Option (3) is correct because the definitions of “trading services” and a “trade in real estate” in the Real Estate Services Act permit trading services licensees to negotiate lease terms. The remaining options are incorrect because they describe activities that do not fall within the definition of trading services.
"Question 525: Julie is acting as the listing licensee for a property owned by her client, George. Julie also represents a client, Ahmed, whom she is helping find a suitable property to buy. Ahmed becomes interested in purchasing George’s property. Julie would like to continue to represent George as a client in the sale of his property, while releasing Ahmed as a client. To do this, Julie must enter into an Agreement Regarding Conflict of Interest Between Clients with: 
(1)George, the continuing client, only 
(2)Ahmed, the released client, only 
(3)Both George and Ahmed 
(4)Neither George nor Ahmed, as the Agreement Regarding Conflict of Interest Between Clients must only be agreed to by Julie’s managing broker","Answer: 3 Explanation: Option (3) is correct because when a licensee is faced with a conflict of interest between multiple clients, the licensee must enter into an Agreement Regarding Conflict of Interest Between Clients with all clients. Options (1), (2), and (4) are incorrect for this reason."
"Question 526: Which one of the following statutes affects the real property taxation system in British Columbia? 
(1)Real Estate Services Act 
(2)School Act 
(3)Arbitration Act 
(4)Land Transfer Form Act",Answer: 2 Explanation: Option (2) is correct because the School Act is one of seven statutes which form the foundation of the real property tax system in British Columbia. The School Act provides for real property taxation to fund public
"Question 527: Martha, who has been George’s landlord for the past three months, has seized George’s furniture from his rented premises and threatens to sell the furniture in order to pay George’s arrears of rent. Which one of the following statements is FALSE? 
(1)Martha has chosen an illegal remedy against George if the rented premises is George’s personal residence. 
(2)Martha has chosen a remedy called “distress” or “distraint”. 
(3)Martha has chosen the most effective remedy against George if the rented premises is a warehouse. 
(4)Martha has taken an action that can be described as a classic example of a private nuisance.","Answer: 4 Explanation: Option (4) is correct because private nuisance typically occurs where an owner or occupier of land unreasonably and substantially interferes with the reasonable use and enjoyment of a neighbouring property. Option (1) is incorrect because section 26(3) of the Residential Tenancy Act abolishes the remedy of distress in residential tenancies. Option (2) is incorrect because “distraint” or “distress” means a seizure and sale of the tenant’s personal property to recover arrears of rent. Option (3) is incorrect because a commercial landlord can exercise the remedy of distress, which is often the most effective remedy available to the landlord."
"Question 528: Which of the following statements about the trial process in British Columbia is FALSE? 
(1)Our common law system is based on an adversarial process in which each of the two opposing parties presents its point of view to an impartial trier of fact whose decision is binding on both parties. 
(2)A plaintiff commences an action by filing a notice of civil claim in the court registry; once served with the notice of civil claim, the defendant can answer by denying some or all of the claims set out in the plaintiff’s notice of civil claim by filing a response to civil claim. 
(3)One of the major reasons why most claims are settled out of court is that the discovery process allows the parties to see more plainly the strengths and weaknesses of their positions. 
(4)The plaintiff and defendant alternate in calling their witnesses.","Answer: 4 Explanation: Option (4) is correct because, in British Columbia, the plaintiff calls each of its witnesses first. Once the defendant’s lawyer has had the opportunity to cross-examine each witness called by the plaintiff, the defendant then calls each of its own witnesses. Options (1), (2), and (3) are incorrect because each statement accurately describes the trial process in British Columbia."
"Question 529: Which of the following people may NOT require an appraisal of real property? 
(1)The executor of an estate 
(2)A property assessment appellant 
(3)A mortgage lender 
(4)A strata council","Answer: 4 Explanation: Option (4) is correct as a strata council is the only party listed that is not likely to require an appraisal. Options (1), (2), and (3) are incorrect because each of these parties are likely to require an appraisal."
"Question 530: When preparing a market value appraisal of a single-family residence, which of the following is LEAST likely to be an acceptable valuation practice? 
(1)Rely on the owner’s information as to the type of water supply piping in the property provided that you note in the appraisal report the source of your information, and that it has not been verified. 
(2)Ignore above-average quality of construction if the buyers and sellers in the neighbourhood do not consider high quality materials important. 
(3)Disregard the recent sale of a house with same floor plan that is within the same subdivision as the subject property if it was sold privately. 
(4)Rely upon the income approach as the primary method of appraisal.","Answer: 4 Explanation: The correct answer is Option (4) since the income approach is more likely a primary method of appraisal for a commercial property valuation with income and expense data, rather than a single-family residence. Options (1) and (2) are incorrect because they describe warranted valuation practices. Option (3) is considered warranted, because although the two houses have similar floor plans and are in the same neighborhood, a sale without sufficient advertising may signal a non-arm’s length sale and would not be considered reliable."
"Question 531: Which one of the following is NOT a depreciable asset? 
(1)A septic tank system 
(2)50 acres of land 
(3)Carpeting 
(4)A concrete patio","Answer: 2 Explanation: Land does not depreciate; therefore Option (2) is correct. Options (1), (3), and (4) are depreciable assets."
"Question 532: Value in exchange is: 
(1)commonly referred to as value to the owner. 
(2)the sale price. 
(3)the owner’s minimum price, called the floor price. 
(4)a range of mutual profit.","Answer: 2 Explanation: Option (2) is correct because the value in exchange is the sale price of the home. Options (1), (3), and (4) are therefore incorrect."
"Question 533: Which of the following is NOT a characteristic of a fee simple estate? 
(1)It is held subject to the Crown’s land use regulations. 
(2)It may be expropriated by the Crown. 
(3)It is a leasehold interest. 
(4)Its owner has it only for as long as they have heirs.","Answer: 3 Explanation: Option (3) is correct because a leasehold interest is of a fixed duration, whereas a fee simple estate confers the right to possess and use land for an indefinite period of time. Option (1) is incorrect because, while the fee simple estate is the greatest estate in land in Canadian law, the Crown retains underlying title to all land. Therefore, fee simple estates remain subject to the Crown’s land use regulations. Option (2) is incorrect because, though rarely exercised, the Crown retains the prerogative power to expropriate land held in fee simple. Option (4) is incorrect because land held in fee simple will escheat (or, revert) back to the Crown if the owner of the estate dies without providing for the transfer of his or her property by way of will and has no known heirs."
"Question 534: Yang was the owner of an office building in downtown Vancouver. She recently sold the building to Ashley for $100 million. Ashley did not pay the GST on the sale and Yang has just received an assessment for the GST due on the sale of the property from the Canada Revenue Agency (“CRA”) worth $5 million. Which of the following statements is FALSE? 
(1)The $5 million is collectible immediately by the CRA. 
(2)Yang will have 90 days from the date of the assessment to file an objection with the CRA if she wishes to dispute it. 
(3)If Yang files an objection and it is affirmed by an appeals officer at the CRA, Yang has exhausted her options in terms of appealing the assessment. 
(4)Yang may pursue Ashley for the uncollected GST that she has been assessed for.","Answer: 3 Explanation: Option (3) is correct (false) because if Yang files an objection and an appeals officer at the CRA confirms the assessment, Yang would have 90 days to appeal to the Tax Court of Canada. She could also potentially appeal the decision to the Federal Court of Appeal and then possibly to the Supreme Court of Canada. Options (1), (2), and (4) are incorrect because they are all true statements."
"Question 535: An offer to purchase real estate: 
(1)must have the words “or nominee” or “or assignee” if the buyer wishes to assign the contract. 
(2)must by default have standard terms relating to contract assignments unless the buyer instructs otherwise. 
(3)always provides either party with the option to assign the contract. 
(4)cannot be assigned.","Answer: 2 Explanation: Option (2) is correct because unless the buyer instructs otherwise, an offer to purchase real estate must have standard terms relating to contract assignment. Option (1) is incorrect because the Knowledge Base, “Assignment Guidelines”, states that these words should not be used to describe the buyer. Option (3) is incorrect because assignments are permissible only as long as the Standard Assignment Terms are included in the contract of purchase and sale of real estate, and provided that the assignment does not prejudice the rights of the seller and the contract does not prohibit assignment. Option (4) is incorrect because a contract of purchase and sale can be assigned if certain requirements are met."
"Question 536: Which of the following is an example of an action that a criminal may take during the placement stage of the money-laundering process? 
(1)Arranging for multiple people to deposit small amounts of cash at different financial institutions 
(2)Transferring money through a succession of bank accounts in different jurisdictions 
(3)Selling real estate that was originally purchased using illicit cash to an unsuspecting buyer 
(4)Frequently transferring ownership of a particular property between multiple acquaintances","Answer: 1 Explanation: Option (1) is correct because it is an action taken during the placement stage, meant to avoid drawing the attention of financial institutions which would take note of unusually large cash deposits. Options (2) and (4) are incorrect because they are actions taken during the layering stage of the money-laundering process, meant to increase complexity and conceal the criminal origins of the proceeds. Option (3) is incorrect because it is an action taken during the integration stage. The sale of real estate will provide proceeds which appear to have been legally earned from investment."
"Question 537: Using the cost approach, determine the market value of a property with a 37,000 square foot building if construction costs new are $62 per square foot, land value is estimated to be $1,200,000, and total depreciation on the building to date is estimated to be 8%. 
(1)$2,294,000 
(2)$3,310,480 
(3)$3,494,000 
(4)$3,214,480","Answer: 2 Explanation: The formula for this question is the costs of improvements plus the site value minus depreciation. Cost of Improvements $2,294,000 ($62  37,000) + Site Value + 1,200,000 $3,494,000  Depreciation  183,520 (0.08  $2,294,000) Market Value $3,310,480"
"Question 538: Which of the following is defined as a marketing initiative that involves face-to-face communication with a potential consumer? 
(1)Telemarketing 
(2)Emotional appeal 
(3)Brand marketing 
(4)Personal selling","Answer: 4 Explanation: Option (4) is correct because personal selling involves interactive, face-to-face communication with a potential customer. Option (1) is incorrect because telemarketing uses telephone or fax technology in place of face-to-face communication. Option (2) is incorrect because emotional appeal refers to a communications strategy that aims to stir up positive or negative emotions in an audience in order to generate a desired response. Option (3) is incorrect because brand marketing refers to a marketing initiative based on the theme of a business, which encompasses a variety of attributes that distinguish the business from its competitors."
"Question 539: There is a large Olympic-sized pool in the backyard of the home Margaret owns in Coquitlam. Each week in the summer, a worker from a pool maintenance company comes in and cleans the pool. Usually when he is cleaning the pool, the backwash runs over and chlorinated water leaks down on the garden of the neighbour below, killing the flowers. Both Margaret and the worker from the pool company are aware of what is happening. This would be considered which of the following? 
(1)A breach of the duty of care under the BC Occupiers Liability Act 
(2)A private nuisance 
(3)A patent defect 
(4)Occupiers liability","Answer: 2 Explanation: Option (2) is correct because a private nuisance occurs when an owner or occupier of land unreasonably and substantially interferes with the reasonable use and enjoyment of a neighbouring property. Private nuisance typically occurs when an owner or occupier wrongfully allows the escape of injurious things (in this case, chlorinated water) onto another person’s land. Options (1) and (4) are incorrect because occupiers liability and the British Columbia Occupiers Liability Act concern the liability of an occupier for injury suffered by visitors entering their own premises, not for losses occurring on someone else’s property. Option (3) is incorrect because a patent defect is a defect in property that can be discovered during the course of a reasonable inspection. On the facts of this question, there is no indication that the leak was caused by any defect in the property of either Margaret or the neighbour."
"Question 540: The income approach is NOT usually used for the valuation of: 
(1)single-family residences. 
(2)warehouses. 
(3)leasehold interests in real property. 
(4)single-storey retail complexes.","Answer: 1 Explanation: Option (1) is correct because the income approach would not usually be used for the valuation of single-family residences. Options (2), (3) and (4) are incorrect because this approach can be used in appraising most types of property, although it is more appropriate for properties that produce rental income, e.g., apartment buildings, office buildings, industrial space."
"Question 541: On March 7, Allan contracts, in writing, to sell his home to Bob for the price of $100,000. The sale is to complete on March 31. On March 8, the house is destroyed. Accordingly, there has been: 
(1)a mutual mistake. 
(2)a frustration of the contract. 
(3)a common mistake. 
(4)a rescission of the contract.","Answer: 2 Explanation: Option (2) is correct because, after a contract has been made, but before it has been performed, it will be frustrated if events outside of the control of the parties destroy the subject matter of the contract. Options (1) and (3) are incorrect because, on the facts of this question, neither Allan nor Bob made a mistake relating to the contract. Option (4) is incorrect because the effect of frustration is the termination of the contract. In other words, the contract is ended at the point of frustration, and future rights and liabilities no longer apply. Termination is distinct from rescission in that rescission operates to “unmake” a contract, attempting to return the parties back to the position they were in prior to entering the contract."
"Question 542: Which of the following statements regarding mortgagees is FALSE? 
(1)A mortgagee may require the addition of a guarantor to provide a separate personal covenant as a third party in addition to the borrower’s personal covenant to pay. 
(2)Where the property secured is a condominium, a mortgagee may require the borrower to grant to the mortgagee the right to vote at meetings of the strata corporation on various matters affecting the security of the mortgage. 
(3)Although a number of remedies are usually available to a mortgagee in the event of borrower default, the lender usually has complete discretion in deciding the most suitable remedy to use in the circumstances. 
(4)Once the mortgage terms have been agreed to by the mortgagor and the mortgagee, the mortgagee is bound to advance the total amount of the funds when requested by the borrower, regardless of the terms of the mortgage.","Answer: 4 Explanation: Option (4) is correct because most mortgages contain a term which states that the mortgagee (the lender) shall not be bound for any reason whatsoever to advance any part of the money to the mortgagor (the borrower). If, for example, a builder’s lien is filed against the property, the lender may require the removal of the lien before advancing funds. Option (1) is incorrect because a lender may require a guarantor as a form of additional security for the loan. Option (2) is incorrect because the Strata Property Act provides that a lender can obtain the right to vote at meetings of the strata corporation on matters relating to insurance, maintenance, finance or other matters affecting the security of the mortgage. Option (3) is incorrect because lenders are generally given complete discretion to select from the available remedies. This ensures that lenders are given the greatest possible chance to recover their losses resulting from a borrower default."
"Question 543: Conditions precedent are usually included in contracts of purchase and sale to protect the buyer. However, since conditions precedent can also be abused by buyers, a seller must be protected when a condition precedent is being included in a contract of purchase and sale. Which of the following additions to the contract of purchase and sale is NOT a valid method of protecting a seller’s interests? 
(1)A specific time within which the condition must be removed can be included in the contract of purchase and sale. 
(2)A clause requiring a Property Disclosure Statement to be filled out can be included in the contract of purchase and sale. 
(3)A covenant can be inserted stating that the buyer will use their best efforts to satisfy the specific condition. 
(4)A time clause can be included, which gives the seller the right to demand that the buyer remove the condition precedent within 72 hours.","Answer: 2 Explanation: Option (2) is correct because it is in the buyer’s (not the seller’s) best interests to incorporate a Property Disclosure Statement (PDS) into the contract of purchase and sale. Doing so incorporates the warranties made by the seller in the PDS into the contract of purchase and sale, which allows the buyer to sue the seller for breach of contract if such warranties are breached. Option (1) is incorrect because it allows the seller to review the buyer’s progress with regards to the fulfilment of the condition and decide whether or not to extend the time limit or to terminate the agreement. Option (3) is incorrect because if such a covenant is inserted into the contract of purchase and sale, and the buyer does not use his or her best efforts to satisfy the specific condition, the seller can sue the buyer for breach of contract. Option (4) is incorrect because a including a 72-hour “time clause” allows the seller to demand that the buyer remove the condition precedent within 72 hours in the event that the seller receives another offer. If the buyer fails to do so, then the seller can accept the other offer."
"Question 544: Which one of the following is TRUE where a comparable property is sold subject to a vendor supplied mortgage at an interest rate lower than the current market rate? 
(1)The comparable property may never be used as evidence of market value. 
(2)The comparable sale price must be adjusted upward. 
(3)The comparable sale price may only be used as evidence of market value. 
(4)The comparable sale price must be adjusted downward.","Answer: 4 Explanation: Option (4) is correct because when a comparable property is sold subject to a low interest rate, the comparable sale price must be adjusted downward. Option (1) is false because the comparable property can be used as evidence of market value, as long as an adjustment is made for the “cheap” financing provided by the vendor. Option (2) is false because the comparable sale price must be adjusted downward to compensate for the benefit provided by the below-market interest rate on the mortgage. Option (3) is false because the price of the comparable property needs to be adjusted to its cash-equivalent price."
"Question 545: An appraiser has located a comparable where the sale price was $220,000, comprised of $105,000 cash and a $115,000 vendor take-back mortgage written at 3.5% per annum, compounded semi-annually, with monthly payments sufficient to fully amortize the loan over 20 years. Assuming that the market rate for similar financing is 5% per annum, compounded semi-annually, what should the appraiser regard as the sale price of the house? (Round answer to the nearest $100). 
(1)$101,300 
(2)$220,000 
(3)$206,300

"Question 546: Allison wants to put aside some money into a savings account to accumulate enough money to go on a trip to Australia. If she can afford to deposit $250 at the end of every month, and the savings account earns interest at j12 = 4%, how much money will have accumulated in the savings account by the end of the third year?

"Question 547: Norm Abrahm has offered $231,000 for a house, providing he is able to obtain acceptable financing. The house lists for $242,000, but the lender has appraised the house at $238,000. The lender requires a loan-to-value ratio of 80% and a gross debt service ratio of 28%. Property taxes are $1,750 per year and Mr. Abrahm’s annual gross income is $85,000. If the interest rate is 12% per annum, compounded annually, the amortization period is 15 years, and payments are made monthly, what is the maximum amount this lender will advance, rounded to the nearest $10? 
(1)$149,910 
(2)$178,500 
(3)$158,270 
(4)$190,400","Answer: 3 Explanation: To answer this question, calculate the maximum amount of money that can be lent out given the two constraints: the loan-to-value amount and the gross debt service ratio amount. Calculate the loan amount for the loan-to-value constraint and then calculate the loan amount for the GDSR constraint. In order to determine the maximum amount that the lender will advance, choose the lesser of the two results. LTV = 80%"
"Question 548: Which of the following clauses contained in a mortgage would constitute a clog on the equity of redemption and therefore be void? 
(1)Collateral advantage clause 
(2)Option to purchase clause 
(3)Indemnity clause 
(4)Acceleration clause","Answer: 2 Explanation: Option (2) is correct because an option to purchase clause, if exercised, would deny the borrower his or her right to redeem title to the property upon repayment of the loan. In other words, if the bank exercised the option and chose to purchase the property, then the borrower would necessarily be unable to redeem title upon repayment. Option (1) is incorrect because collateral advantage clauses are no longer considered clogs on the borrower’s equity of redemption, even if they extend beyond the term of the mortgage. Option (3) is incorrect because indemnity clauses do not constitute clogs on the equity of redemption, and are instead rendered unenforceable by section 8(1) of the federal Interest Act. Option (4) is incorrect because an acceleration clause is a term in the mortgage contract which makes the outstanding balance of the loan immediately due and payable if the borrower defaults. Acceleration clauses do not interfere with the borrower’s right to redeem title upon repayment, since they operate in situations where the borrower has defaulted."
"Question 549: The MOST effective remedy available to a landlord when a tenant does not pay the rent in a commercial tenancy is: 
(1)an injunction. 
(2)a garnishing order. 
(3)distress. 
(4)a demand letter.","Answer: 3 Explanation: Option (3) is correct because the remedy of distress allows a commercial landlord to seize and sell a tenant’s personal property in order to satisfy a claim for rent owing. This is the most effective remedy because it immediately gives the landlord tangible assets which can be sold to recover the debt. Option (1) is incorrect because a tenant may choose to disobey an injunction, which would require that the landlord take additional legal action against them. Option (2) is incorrect because the third party to whom the garnishing order is served may still disobey the garnishing order. There are also additional limitations to this remedy, including a limit on the percentage that may be garnished from an employee’s wages. Option (4) is incorrect because a demand letter may be ignored by the tenant, in which case the landlord would be required to pursue additional action."
"Question 550: Where an agent with authority enters into a contract with a third party and does not disclose that they are acting as an agent: 
(1)the third party may sue either the agent or the principal to enforce the contract. 
(2)the principal may sue the agent to enforce the contract. 
(3)only the agent may sue the third party to enforce the contract. 
(4)there is no contract in existence because there is no disclosure.","Answer: 1 Explanation: Option (1) is correct because, at common law, where an agent does not disclose to a third party that he or she is acting as an agent, the agent may be held liable as a principal. This rule is justified because the third party was led to believe that it was making a contract with the agent personally, and might not have chosen to enter a contract with the principal had they been aware of the principal’s existence and/or identity. Option (2) is incorrect because the contract is not between the agent and the principal, but is instead between the principal and the third party (though the agent may be held liable as a principal, as mentioned previously). Option (3) is incorrect because the contract remains between the principal and the third party, and therefore, the principal may sue the third party to enforce it. Option (4) is incorrect because an agent’s failure to disclose their status as an agent does not render a contract void."
"Question 551: In mortgage financing, a constant payment mortgage is one where: 
(1)each payment is identical to the preceding one. 
(2)the payments are comprised of a constant amount of principal plus interest due. 
(3)the payments decrease in size during the term of the loan. 
(4)principal and interest are the same amount for each payment.",Answer: 1 Explanation: Option (1) is correct because a constant payment mortgage has identical periodic payments. Options (2) and (3) describe a straight line principal reduction loan. Option (4) is incorrect because the constant payment is apportioned to varying levels of principal and interest.
"Question 552: A trading services representative must never promise to sell real estate belonging to a prospective client, as an inducement to enter into a listing agreement with the licensee’s brokerage: 
(1)unless at the time of making the promise, a signed statement setting forth the details of the promise is given to the person to whom the promise has been made. 
(2)unless at the time of making the promise, the representative has in fact lined up a buyer for the property. 
(3)unless they have been authorized to make such a promise. 
(4)unless the buyer is also a licensee.","Answer: 1 Explanation: Option (1) is correct because the Real Estate Services Rules prohibit a licensee from making inducement promises of this nature unless the licensee gives a signed statement containing the details of the promise to the person to whom the promise is made. A licensee who breaches this prohibition may be suspended by the British Columbia Financial Services Authority. Options (2), (3), and (4) are incorrect because none of these scenarios alleviate the licensee’s obligation to give a signed statement, setting forth the details of the promise, to the person to whom the promise is being made."
"Question 553: A property owner is making an application to the municipal council to amend a zoning bylaw. Which of the following steps is NOT a part of the rezoning process? 
(1)The municipal council must vote in favour of the amendment on four different occasions (readings). 
(2)According to the Local Government Act, the municipal council must wait at least six months before approving the amendment. 
(3)The applicant may be required to donate a portion of their land to the municipality to be used as a park or pay to widen an existing road. 
(4)The applicant may be required to give a presentation about the amendment and answer questions from the municipal council at a public hearing.","Answer: 2 Explanation: Option (2) is correct because the municipal council is not required to wait at least six months before approving an amendment to a zoning bylaw. Option (1) is incorrect because any rezoning bylaw must be given four readings by the municipal council, meaning that the council must vote in favour of the bylaw four separate times. Option (3) is incorrect because subdivision bylaws, made under the Local Government Act, may require that an owner dedicate up to five percent of his or her land for park purposes. In addition, sometimes an applicant will be required to pay for the widening of roads. Option (4) is incorrect because after a proposed rezoning bylaw receives a favourable first (or sometimes second) reading, a public hearing is usually held. At the hearing, the applicant may be required to give a short presentation, and will be asked questions about the proposal by the municipal council."
"Question 554: You have a partially completed appraisal report that you need to fill in. The subject property has 4 bedrooms and 4 bathrooms. The house next door is similar in all respects except for the number of bedrooms and bathrooms. It sold for $225,500 and has 3 bedrooms and 3 bathrooms. If the market value of a bedroom is $4,000 and the market value of a bathroom is $5,700, this comparable will have to be adjusted for bedrooms and bathrooms by: 
(1)–$4,000 and –$5,700 respectively. 
(2)+$6,400 and +$5,700 respectively. 
(3)+$4,000 and +$5,700 respectively. 
(4)+$5,700 and +$4,000 respectively.","Answer: 3 Explanation: Option (3) is correct because in relation to the subject property, this comparable requires an adjustment of +$4,000 for 1 bedroom and +$5,700 for 1 bathroom. Options (1), (2), and (4) are therefore incorrect."
"Question 555: In order for a person to make a successful claim against the Assurance Fund in British Columbia, they must prove three of the following. Indicate the EXCEPTION. 
(1)They have lost an interest or estate in land. 
(2)They cannot recover that interest or estate by court action. 
(3)The person who deprived the injured party of their interest or estate in land has resold the interest to a bona fide purchaser for valuable consideration. 
(4)If the Land Title Act had not been passed, they would have recovered the interest in land by a court action.","Answer: 3 Explanation: Option (3) is correct because, in addition to compensating victims of fraud, the Assurance Fund also provides compensation to individuals who have suffered loss or damages caused, solely or partially, by an omission, mistake or misfeasance of the registrar or employees of the Land Title Office. Options (1), (2), and (4) are incorrect because a claimant must prove the following to successfully claim against the Assurance Fund in British Columbia: (a) that the claimant has lost an interest in land as a result of the registration of a person other than the claimant as owner; (b) that the claimant cannot recover that estate or interest (or compensation for it) by a court action; and (c) that, if the Land Title Act had not been passed, the claimant would have recovered the estate or interest at common law by a court action."
"Question 556: Using the comparative approach of appraisal to value properties with redevelopment potential, it is NOT necessary that the comparables and the subject property: 
(1)have a similar highest and best use after redevelopment. 
(2)have a similar current use. 
(3)have a market value of zero in their current use. 
(4)expect to undergo redevelopment at a similar point in time.","Answer: 3 Explanation: Option (3) is correct because when using the comparative approach of appraisal to value properties with redevelopment potential, it is not necessary that the comparables and the subject property have a market value of zero in their current use. Options (1), (2), and (4) are incorrect because it is necessary that they have a similar highest and best use after redevelopment, have a similar current use, and expect to undergo redevelopment at a similar point in time."
"Question 557: A seller refuses to acknowledge the waiver of a condition precedent from a contract of purchase and sale. Assuming that the condition was made exclusively for the benefit of the buyer and the waiver was made prior to the expiry of the condition precedent, the agreement is: 
(1)one that is not binding on either party. 
(2)voidable at the option of the seller. 
(3)binding. 
(4)voidable at the option of the buyer.","Answer: 3 Explanation: Option (3) is correct because section 54 of the Law and Equity Act provides that where a condition precedent is for the sole benefit of the buyer, the buyer is allowed to unilaterally waive the condition prior to its expiration. Section 54 overrides the common law rule preventing the unilateral waiver of a true condition precedent. Option (1) is incorrect because the agreement remains valid and enforceable in this situation. Options (2) and (4) are incorrect because, in this situation, the agreement does not become voidable at either the option of the seller or the buyer."
"Question 558: When, with respect to commercial tenancies, there is said to be an implied covenant of quiet enjoyment, it means: 
(1)that the landlord will refrain and will cause others to refrain from entering into competition with the tenant’s business. 
(2)that the tenant will conduct their affairs in such a manner as not to violate local noise bylaws and that, if they do, they will be liable for any fines or penalties levied. 
(3)that the landlord provides assurance to the tenant against the consequence of a defective title involving the landlord or those lawfully claiming under them. 
(4)that the landlord will ensure that all tenants conduct their affairs in such a manner as not to violate local noise bylaws.","Answer: 3 Explanation: Option (3) is correct because, with respect to commercial tenancies, the implied covenant of quiet enjoyment does not simply refer to freedom from noise; rather, it is an assurance to the tenant against the consequences of defective title. This means that if the landlord, or anyone who claims to have received rights from the landlord, attacks the tenant’s right to the premises, it would breach this covenant. Option (1) is incorrect because the implied covenant of quiet enjoyment does not concern competition with the tenant’s business. Option (2) is incorrect because the implied covenant of quiet enjoyment is an implied promise given by the landlord to the tenant, and does not restrict the tenant’s own conduct on the property. Option (4) is incorrect because the implied covenant of quiet enjoyment does not constitute a guarantee by the landlord that other tenants will comply with local noise bylaws."

"Question 560: Which of the following statements about restrictive covenants is FALSE? 
(1)A restrictive covenant must be negative in nature. 
(2)Both the benefited and burdened land must be precisely identified in the agreement or document creating the restrictive covenant. 
(3)The burden of the restriction must have been intended by the parties to bind the land. 
(4)The covenantor must retain the restricted property, as any subsequent buyer will not be a party to the original contract.","Answer: 4 Explanation: Option (4) is correct because a restrictive covenant is an interest in land which can be registered at the Land Title Office. Once a valid restrictive covenant has been registered, it binds subsequent owners of the property (i.e., it “runs with the land”). Therefore, the covenantor (the person who agrees to be bound by the restriction) need not retain the restricted property for the restrictive covenant to remain valid. Option (1) is incorrect because, in order to be a valid restrictive covenant, an owner must be able to comply with the covenant by not doing something. If a covenant requires action it is a “positive” covenant, and does not run with the land. Options (2) and (3) are both incorrect because each statement is one of the five essential requirements of a valid restrictive covenant."
"Question 561: An agent’s duty to the principal not to make a secret profit means that an agent must keep the principal fully informed about which of the following? 
(1)All of the agent’s personal business dealings 
(2)The agent’s annual tax return 
(3)All of the actual benefits and prospective benefits accruing to the agent as a result of the agency relationship 
(4)Only the actual profits received by the agent","Answer: 3 Explanation: Option (3) is correct because an agent owes a duty of loyalty to the principal, which requires them to disclose to the principal all facts relevant to the transaction within the agent’s knowledge. The complete disclosure requirement prohibits an agent from making a “secret” profit, meaning that the agent must disclose all of the benefits and prospective benefits received by the agent as a result of, or in the course of, performing duties on behalf of the principal. Option (1) is incorrect because the agent is not required to disclose all of their personal business dealings to the principal if those dealings do not affect the interests of the principal. Option (2) is incorrect because the agent is not required to inform the principal of their own annual tax return, as this information does not affect the interests of the principal. Option (4) is incorrect because an agent has a duty to disclose all relevant facts that could influence the conduct of the principal. This duty is not limited to situations where the agent is receiving actual profits, and extends to situations where the agent will suffer a loss."
"Question 562: In appraising an income-producing property using the income approach, gross potential rents must be estimated. How are gross potential rents BEST determined? 
(1)Based on long-term vacancy rates in the area in which the subject property is located 
(2)Based on published surveys of relevant real estate trends 
(3)Based on the relationship between money actually received and units actually rented 
(4)Based on current market rents of similar properties","Answer: 4 Explanation: Option (4) is correct because gross potential revenue is estimated using current market rents paid on similar properties. Even when the subject or comparable property is fully rented, the rents used in determining the property’s net operating income should be compared to current rental prices. Therefore, Options (1), (2), and (3) are incorrect."
"Question 563: When a strata corporation grants an owner or tenant of a strata lot the permission to exclusively use common property as a short term exclusive use: 
(1)the permission requires approval by a ¾ vote at a general meeting of the strata corporation, unless the short term exclusive use is to endure for less than six months. 
(2)the permission may be granted by a majority vote of the strata council if the permission does not involve a significant change in the use or appearance of the common property. 
(3)the permission is identical to the designation of limited common property for the benefit of a strata lot owner. 
(4)the strata corporation must not grant the permission for more than one month.","Answer: 2 Explanation: Option (2) is correct because the Strata Property Act gives strata corporations the ability to grant an owner or tenant permission to exclusively use common property for a period of less than one year. If the permission does not involve a significant change in the use or appearance of the common property, then the permission can be granted by a majority vote of the strata council. Option (1) is incorrect because approval by a ¾ vote, rather than a simple majority vote, at a general meeting of the strata corporation is only required where the permission or privilege granted involves a significant change in the use or appearance of the property. Option (3) is incorrect because permission to exclusively use common property may only be granted for less than one year, whereas the designation of limited common property has no fixed duration and need not be renewed. Therefore, the permission to exclusively use common property cannot be identical to the designation of limited common property. Option (4) is incorrect because the strata corporation may grant the permission for up to one year."
"Question 564: Which one of the following is NOT an activity of a Board of Variance? 
(1)To permit a structural alteration to a building used for a non-conforming use 
(2)To hear an appeal where the enforcement of a zoning bylaw will cause undue hardship 
(3)To amend a zoning bylaw 
(4)To establish a time limit within which construction of a minor variance must be completed","Answer: 3 Explanation: Option (3) is correct because a Board of Variance does not have the jurisdiction to amend zoning bylaws. Instead, the function of a Board of Variance is to permit minor exceptions, or “variances”, to existing bylaws, without altering the bylaws themselves. Amending zoning bylaws is the responsibility of municipal councils and regional districts. Options (1), (2), and (4) are incorrect because a Board of Variance is given the authority to hear appeals in situations where the enforcement of a bylaw would cause undue hardship. To achieve this purpose, the Board may permit a structural alteration to a building used for a non-conforming use, and may establish time limits within which construction of a variance must be completed."
"Question 565: The REALTOR® Code of Ethics is enforced by the: 
(1)Canadian Real Estate Association. 
(2)local real estate boards. 
(3)British Columbia Real Estate Association. 
(4)British Columbia Financial Services Authority.","Answer: 2 Explanation: Option (2) is correct because the REALTOR® Code of Ethics is enforced by the local real estate boards in British Columbia. Option (1) is incorrect because, while the Canadian Real Estate Association establishes the REALTOR® Code of Ethics, enforcement occurs at the local board level. Option (3) is incorrect because the British Columbia Real Estate Association is responsible for representing the interests of local real estate boards, and their members on provincial matters, and does not directly enforce the REALTOR® Code of Ethics. Option (4) is incorrect because the British Columbia Financial Services Authority (“BCFSA”) is a statutory body tasked with administering the Real Estate Services Act (RESA) and related regulations, and rules. The REALTOR® Code of Ethics is set by the Canadian Real Estate Association, which is a professional trade organization that is separate from BCFSA."
"Question 566: Which of the following information is NOT necessary for a brokerage to keep in the real estate trade record sheet? 
(1)The date of the MLS® listing 
(2)The sale price or other consideration for the trade in real estate 
(3)The nature of the trade in real estate 
(4)The names and addresses of all parties to the trade in real estate","Answer: 1 Explanation: Option (1) is correct because a real estate trade record sheet is required for each transaction in which the brokerage or a related licensee holds or receives money. Since listing a property on the MLS® listing occurs prior to such a transaction, this information does not need to be included in the record sheet. Options (2), (3), and (4) are incorrect because each contains information that is necessary to accurately describe and record real estate transactions."
"Question 567: Sections 15 and 18(1) of the Manufactured Home Act provide that no person shall move a manufactured home UNLESS: 
(1)the manufactured home is registered in the land titles office. 
(2)the manufactured home is registered in the manufactured homes registry, and a transport permit has been obtained from the registrar. 
(3)the manufactured home is free of any security interests registered against it in the personal property registry. 
(4)they are the registered owner of the manufactured home.","Answer: 2 Explanation: Option (2) is correct because section 15 of the Manufactured Home Act provides that no person may move a manufactured home unless it is registered in the manufactured homes registry. Additionally, section 18(1) requires that a transport permit be obtained from the registrar to authorize the movement of the home to a specific location. Option (1) is incorrect because the ownership, transfer and granting of charges of manufactured homes are not registered in the land title office. Option (3) is incorrect because a manufactured home with a security interest registered against it in the personal property registry can still be moved. The secured party remains protected because registrar is required to notify the secured party when an application for a transport permit is made. Option (4) is incorrect because, in certain cases, a landlord, a secured party, or any other person acting under a court order may obtain a transport permit authorizing them to move a manufactured home."
"Question 568: Bert and Ernie owned, as joint tenants, a revenue producing property, which was leased to Oscar. Ernie died, leaving a will, which gave his interest in the property to Grover. Grover is now demanding one-half of the rent paid by Oscar. Bert refuses this request. Which of the following statements is TRUE? 
(1)Bert and Grover now own the revenue producing property as joint tenants. 
(2)Bert and Grover now own the revenue producing property as tenants in common. 
(3)No interest in the property could be transferred to Grover via Ernie’s will because the entire estate passed to Bert when Ernie died. 
(4)Ernie severed the joint tenancy by bequeathing his interest in the property to Grover. Therefore, Grover is entitled to a one-half interest in the property.","Answer: 3 Explanation: Option (3) in correct because joint tenants enjoy the right of survivorship, meaning that when one joint tenant dies, the entire estate automatically vests in the surviving joint tenant(s). Bert, therefore, became the sole owner of the revenue producing property immediately upon Ernie’s death and Ernie had no interest to dispose of in his will. Options (1) and (2) are incorrect because no interest in the property passed to Grover. Option (4) is incorrect because a joint tenant cannot sever a joint tenancy merely by bequeathing their interest in the property to a third party in their will. To sever the joint tenancy Ernie would have had to (a) destroy one of the four “unities” required for a joint tenancy to exist (e.g., by selling or mortgaging his estate); (b) partition the property via a mutual agreement with Bert; or (c) obtain a court order for partition."
"Question 569: There are three common types of void deeds. Which one is considered NOT to be a void deed? 
(1)An unregistered deed 
(2)A forged deed 
(3)A deed given for illegal consideration 
(4)A deed signed in circumstances where the party can plead non est factum","Answer: 1 Explanation: Option (1) is correct because section 20(1) of the Land Title Act provides that “except as against the person making it”, an unregistered transfer deed is inoperative. This section indicates that an unregistered deed remains operative between the transferor and the transferee. Option (2) is incorrect because it is a long standing common law rule that a forged deed is void from the beginning. Option (3) is incorrect because, where the consideration given exchange for a deed amounts to an illegal act or thing, the transfer deed is void. Option (4) is incorrect because where a party can successfully plead non est factum (“that is not my deed”) the deed in question will be rendered void for reason of unilateral mistake."
"Question 570: Which one of the following is FALSE with respect to the proprietorship form of business? 
(1)A proprietorship is terminated upon the death of the owner. 
(2)A proprietor must pay tax on their business income at personal tax rates. 
(3)The proprietor is liable for all debts of their business to the extent of their capital investment in the business only. 
(4)There is no legal separation of the assets of the business and the other assets of its owner.","Answer: 3 Explanation: Option (3) is correct because, since a sole proprietorship is a business enterprise owned by a single individual, the owner of a proprietorship is personally liable for all the debts incurred by the proprietorship. This means that, if the proprietorship is unable to pay its debts, the proprietorship’s creditors may collect from the personal assets of the owner. Option (1) is incorrect because, since a proprietorship is not regarded as a separate legal entity from the owner, it is terminated upon the death of the owner. Option (2) is incorrect because the profits of a proprietorship accrue to the owner and are taxed as part of his or her personal income. Option (4) is incorrect because, as stated previously, a proprietorship is not regarded as a separate legal entity from the owner, and the owner has unlimited liability."
"Question 571: Hurston, the Head of Production at XYZ Preservatives Ltd., has been ordered by the company’s president, in Toronto, to vent some gasses that have been stored in a pressure chamber at the Vancouver plant. Although the president knows that the gas is highly toxic, Hurston has been assured by the president that the gas is totally harmless and will quickly dissipate when released. Unfortunately, having escaped from the pressure chamber, the gas drifts in a dense cloud over Ralph’s neighbouring apple orchard and destroys the apple crop. Which one of the following is TRUE? 
(1)Ralph will be successful in a claim against XYZ’s president under the doctrine of trespass. 
(2)Ralph will probably succeed in a claim against XYZ based on negligence. 
(3)Ralph will be successful in his claim against XYZ based on XYZ breaching its fiduciary duty towards Ralph. 
(4)Ralph would probably have a successful claim against XYZ based on the provisions of the Occupiers Liability Act.","Answer: 2 Explanation: Option (2) is correct because Ralph will likely be able to establish the three elements required for a successful negligence claim: (1) that XYZ, a company storing highly toxic gasses, owed him a duty of care as his neighbour; (2) that XYZ breached the standard of care by allowing the gas to drift over Ralph’s apple orchard; and (3) that the damage to Ralph’s orchard was reasonably foreseeable (i.e. not too remote). Option (1) is incorrect because trespass is an intentional tort, and consequently must be a direct, voluntary act, as opposed to an indirect result of an act. In this case, there is no indication that Hurston or the President intended to release the gas over Ralph’s apple orchard. Option (3) is incorrect because a fiduciary duty is only owed by a person who holds a legally significant position of trust with respect to someone else, and is obliged, by virtue of that relationship or trust, to act solely for the other person’s benefit. There is no indication, on the facts provided, that XYZ was in such a relationship of trust with Ralph. Option (4) is incorrect because the Occupiers Liability Act would only apply if Ralph had suffered damage while on XYZ’s premises."
"Question 572: Under the Residential Tenancy Act, the landlord is entitled to collect a security deposit equal to: 
(1)one half of one month’s rent. 
(2)one month’s rent. 
(3)the first and last month’s rent. 
(4)six months’ rent.","Answer: 1 Explanation: Option (1) is correct because the Regulations passed under the Residential Tenancy Act provide that a security deposit for a residential tenancy agreement cannot exceed one half of the monthly rent. Options (2), (3), and (4) are incorrect because each of these amounts exceeds the amount permitted under the Act."
"Question 573: Joe Carmichael borrows $11,000 at a periodic interest rate of 0.75% per month. He agrees to repay $335 per month. For how many FULL years will Joe have to make payments? 
(1)3 
(2)9 
(3)27 
(4)37","Answer: 1 Explanation: For this question, with a given monthly periodic rate, calculate how many years Joe will make payments. First, express the rate as a j12, then calculate N. Press Display .75 × 12 = I/YR 9 12  P/YR 12 11000 PV 11,000 335 +/ PMT 335 0 FV 0 N 37.837088 (months) ÷ 12 = 3.153091 (years) N is expressed as months; therefore, divide by 12 to express the amortization in years. Joe will have to make payments for three full years."
"Question 574: When casual reference is made to the current mortgage lending rate, the common practice is to quote: 
(1)effective annual interest rates. 
(2)nominal interest rates. 
(3)equivalent interest rates. 
(4)interest rates per compounding period.","Answer: 2 Explanation: Option (2) is correct because when mortgage interest rates are casually referenced, it is typically a nominal interest rate. Therefore, Options (1), (3), and (4) are incorrect."
"Question 575: Charlotte offered to sell her property to Dennis for $180,000 by email. Dennis emailed, “Send lowest cash price – will give $165,000 cash”. Charlotte replied, “Cannot reduce price”. Dennis then accepted the original offer but Charlotte refused to sell claiming that there was no contract. Which of the following statements is TRUE? 
(1)There is no contract because Charlotte’s reply was not a renewal of her original offer. 
(2)Charlotte’s reply to Dennis’ first wire was, in effect, a counter-offer on the same terms as her original offer. 
(3)Charlotte may successfully claim that her initial price of $180,000 was an “invitation to treat” and therefore she was entitled to refuse Dennis’ offer to pay that amount. 
(4)Options (1) and (3) are both true.","Answer: 2 Explanation: Option (2) is correct because Charlotte effectively revived her original offer (to sell her property to Dennis for $180,000), which Dennis then accepted. Dennis’ offer of $165,000 was a counter-offer, which therefore terminated the original offer. However, Charlotte made her own counter-offer when she replied, “cannot reduce price”, which effectively renewed her original offer. Option (1) is incorrect because the case of Livingstone v. Evans tells us that the words “cannot reduce price”, uttered in this context, renew the original offer. Dennis was therefore entitled to accept the renewed offer. Option (3) is incorrect because Charlotte’s initial email contained the necessary terms (the property and the price) to constitute an offer capable of being accepted, and therefore was more than a mere invitation to treat. Option (4) is incorrect because Options (1) and (3) are both incorrect."
"Question 576: “A contract respecting land or a disposition of land is not enforceable unless there is, in writing signed by the party to be charged or by his agent, both an indication that it has been made and a reasonable indication of the subject matter...” The preceding is an extract from which statute? 
(1)Real Estate Services Act 
(2)Statute of Frauds 
(3)Land Title Act 
(4)Law and Equity Act","Answer: 4 Explanation: Option (4) is correct because this extract is taken from section 59(3)(a) of the Law and Equity Act. Therefore, Options (1), (2), and (3) are incorrect."
"Question 577: Anna is interested in purchasing Elizabeth’s house. In an attempt to save money, instead of hiring a licensed home inspector, Anna thoroughly inspects Elizabeth’s house herself and does not find any defects or deficiencies. After the sale completes, Anna discovers a major issue with the foundation of the house that will cost $55,000 to fix. As a result, Anna sues Elizabeth for failing to disclose the issue with the foundation. Which of the following is TRUE? 
(1)Because the deficiency in the foundation is a major issue, Elizabeth is liable to Anna, even if she did not know about the defect. 
(2)Elizabeth would only be required to disclose this defect if Anna specifically asked about the foundation. 
(3)Anna’s claim against Elizabeth for failing to disclose the foundation issue will likely fail if it can be shown that any qualified home inspector would have identified the issue. 
(4)The foundation issue is known as a property stigma.","Answer: 3 Explanation: Option (3) is correct because if a qualified home inspector would have identified the issue, it would likely be classified as a patent defect, which sellers do not have an obligation to disclose. As a buyer, Anna has a duty to conduct a reasonable inspection and make reasonable inquiries to ensure that there are no patent defects, which typically involves consulting a licensed home inspector. Option (1) is incorrect because, even for major issues, the seller is only required to disclose latent defects that he or she knows or should have reasonably known. Option (2) is incorrect because sellers are required to disclose known latent defects that render the property dangerous or unfit for habitation, even if the buyer did not specifically ask about that defect. Option (4) is incorrect because the defect’s impact on the property can be objectively determined at a value of $55,000 and therefore cannot be classified as a stigma."
"Question 578: On June 1, Jem offered to buy Boo’s summer cottage for $230,000, and Boo accepted. Since the cottage was on a secluded island, neither party was aware that on May 30, the cottage was struck by lightning and completely destroyed by fire. Boo has no insurance and is seeking to enforce the contract. Which of the following statements is TRUE? 
(1)This is an example of mutual mistake and Jem can rescind the contract. 
(2)The doctrine of frustration applies here and both parties are relieved of their future obligations under the contract. 
(3)A court will set aside the contract based on “non est factum” (it is not my deed) or unilateral mistake since Jem did not know the nature of the document he was signing and could not have known the cottage was no longer standing. 
(4)This is an example of common mistake and the contract is void.","Answer: 4 Explanation: Option (4) is correct because a common mistake occurs when both parties to a contract make the same mistake about a fundamental term of the contract, such as the existence of what is being sold. In this case, the fact that the cottage had been destroyed prior to the formation of the contract was unknown to both parties. The existence of a common mistake such as this renders a contract void. Option (1) is incorrect because a mutual mistake occurs when both parties make a fundamental mistake about the contract but each makes a different mistake. Here, the mistake was the same (the assumption that the cottage still existed). Option (2) is incorrect because frustration occurs where a specific thing that is necessary for the performance of the contract is no longer in existence at the time for performance. In this case, the cottage was destroyed before the contract was entered into, meaning that frustration does not apply. Option (3) is incorrect because (a) there is no indication that Jem did not understand the nature of the contract of sale; and (b) the mistake regarding the existence of the cottage was a common mistake, not a unilateral mistake since both Jem and Boo were mistaken."
"Question 579: Which of the following is a FALSE statement regarding the duties licensees owe to their clients under the Real Estate Services Rules? 
(1)The duty to act in the client’s best interests does not include taking actions that are unlawful. 
(2)The duty to act within the scope of authority given by the client does not include signing agreements for the client unless written permission is received. 
(3)The duty of confidentiality is terminated when the relationship between the licensee and the client ends. 
(4)The duty of full disclosure can include disclosing information a licensee may see as trivial.","Answer: 3 Explanation: Option (3) is correct because it is false. The duty of confidentiality to a client lasts forever. Option (1) is incorrect because actions that are unlawful would be against the duty of acting in the client’s best interest. Option (2) is incorrect because section 45 of the Real Estate Services Rules requires licensees to obtain written authorization to sign agreements on behalf of their clients. Option (4) is incorrect because full disclosure requires licensees disclose to their clients all known material information, no matter how trivial."
"Question 580: At common law and unless the agreement stipulates to the contrary, as soon as a contract is signed for the purchase and sale of real property, the risk of loss or damage suffered between the signing of the contract and the completion falls on: 
(1)the buyer. 
(2)the seller. 
(3)the seller’s insurance company. 
(4)no one.","Answer: 1 Explanation: Option (1) is correct because one of the undesirable aspects of the common law pertaining to contracts is that when no mention of the state of title is made in the contract beneficial ownership, and therefore risk of loss or damage, passes to the buyer at the time the contract is signed. The standard form Contract of Purchase and Sale in BC expressly alters this common law presumption. Options (2), (3), and (4) are therefore incorrect."
"Question 581: What is the key purpose that is achieved when a licensee fulfills section 54 of the Rules and provides a consumer with a Disclosure of Representation in Trading Services form? 
(1)Informed consent 
(2)Undivided loyalty 
(3)Fiduciary duty 
(4)Disclosure of interest in trade","Answer: 1 Explanation: Option (1) is correct because the key purpose of the Disclosure of Representation in Trading Services form is to ensure that consumers understand how trading services can be provided to them, so that they can provide informed consent to the chosen form of relationship with the real estate licensee. Options (2), (3), and (4) are incorrect for this reason."
"Question 582: You, as a trading services licensee working in a “hot” market, have recently listed a property for sale at $850,000. An offer of $840,000 was received at 8:30 this morning. At noon, a second offer of $845,000 was received and a third offer of $850,000 at 2:30 in the afternoon. You will be seeing the seller at 7:00 this evening. Which offer is to be presented? 
(1)All of the offers 
(2)The offer of $840,000 
(3)The offer of $845,000 
(4)The offer of $850,000","Answer: 1 Explanation: Option (1) is correct because licensees have a duty to present all options to a client (which includes all offers) unless the client has given specific instructions to somehow limit which offers are to be presented. Options (2), (3), and (4) are incorrect because all three offers must be presented to your client."
"Question 583: A mortgage of the mortgagor’s equity of redemption is called: 
(1)a lien. 
(2)an equitable mortgage. 
(3)an agreement for sale. 
(4)a lease.","Answer: 2 Explanation: Option (2) is correct because a borrower who grants a legal mortgage retains an equitable interest in the property. The borrower is free to mortgage this equitable interest by granting a second, or subsequent, mortgage. These subsequent mortgages are mortgages on the borrower’s equity of redemption (the borrower’s right to repay the mortgage and redeem title to the property). Option (1) is incorrect because, though also a form of security interest, a lien is not a mortgage. Options (3) and (4) are incorrect because agreements for sale and leases are not mortgages."
"Question 584: The Court Order usually obtained first in a foreclosure action is an: 
(1)order nisi. 
(2)order absolute. 
(3)order for sale. 
(4)order for specific performance.","Answer: 1 Explanation: Option (1) is correct because, at the first court appearance where a claim for foreclosure is brought, a judge will generally grant an order nisi. The order nisi is an important preliminary step because it sets the final redemption period, during which the respondents can redeem the mortgage by paying the amount due and owing. Options (2) and (3) are incorrect because orders absolute and orders for sale may be obtained if payment is not made within the redemption period set by the order nisi. Option (4) is incorrect because an order for specific performance may be available in the case of an agreement for sale, but is not an available remedy for foreclosure actions."
"Question 585: Which one of the following is a liability on a financial statement? 
(1)Accumulated depreciation 
(2)Mortgages payable 
(3)Wages paid 
(4)Prepaid expense","Answer: 2 Explanation: Option (2) is correct because mortgages payable represents a debt that must be repaid. Option (1) is incorrect because accumulated depreciation is part of the assets section on the balance sheet, and takes away from the value of the depreciable asset(s). Options (3) and (4) are incorrect because wages paid is listed as an expense, and prepaid expenses are listed as a current asset."
"Question 586: Which of the following options is inconsistent with generally accepted accounting principles? 
(1)Expenses directly associated with particular revenues are recognized at the time they are incurred. 
(2)Assets are revalued upwards to account for the effect of inflation. 
(3)Fiscal year ends cannot be changed at will. 
(4)Revenues are recognized at the time they are earned.","Answer: 2 Explanation: Option (2) is correct because revaluing assets is inconsistent with the cost principle. Option (1) is consistent with the matching principle, Option (3) is consistent with the consistency principle, and Option (4) is consistent with the revenue recognition principle."
"Question 587: The secondary mortgage market: 
(1)occurs when a borrower receives funds secured by a mortgage from a bank. 
(2)is the market in which existing mortgages are bought and sold as financial investments. 
(3)has been weakened by the introduction of mortgage-backed securities and Canada mortgage bonds. 
(4)is the market in which mortgage loans are initiated.","Answer: 2 Explanation: Option (2) is correct because a secondary mortgage market is the market in which existing mortgages are bought and sold between investors. Options (1), (3), and (4) are incorrect."
"Question 588: An investor wants to decide whether to buy a mortgage written for $100,000 at j12 = 3.5% that calls for monthly payments, a 20-year amortization, and a 5-year term. If the investor can earn j12 = 6% with other investments, at what price should the mortgage be purchased? 
(1)$80,951.26 
(2)$110,669.93 
(3)$90,143.73 
(4)$89,602.21","Answer: 3 Explanation: If the investor can earn j12 = 6% on other investments, the purchase price of the mortgage should be based on a market value of j12 = 6%. First, calculate the mortgage payment based on the contract rate of j12 = 3.5%. Since this question also has a 5-year term, calculate the outstanding balance at the end of the 5-year term and set this amount equal to the future value with N equal to 60.

"Question 589: Constant payment repayment schemes developed in response to: 
(1)rapid inflation. 
(2)the federal government’s desire to stimulate the demand for and supply of housing after World War II. 
(3)interest rate risk. 
(4)principal risk.","Answer: 4 Explanation: Option (4) is correct because constant payment loans were developed in response to the risk to the lender of default on principal. The constant payment reduces this risk as each periodic payment reduces the amount of principal at risk. Options (1), (2), and (3) are incorrect."
"Question 590: The appraisal of condominium units using the market comparison approach has some distinct differences from the appraisal of other types of real property. Which one of the following factors might be applicable to condominiums ONLY? 
(1)Location and neighbourhood 
(2)Quality of construction 
(3)Common area charges 
(4)Interest rate on the mortgage","Answer: 3 Explanation: Option (3) is correct because common area charges could be applicable to condominiums only, as condominiums consist of a tenancy in common interest in the common areas of the development, while some other types of real property do not. Options (1), (2), and (4) are incorrect because location and neighbourhood, quality of construction, and the interest rate on the mortgage are applicable to all types of property, not just condominiums."

"Question 597: Jake wants to purchase a house that is listed for $276,000. The bank’s appraiser estimates that the lending value of the property is $275,000. Jake’s gross annual income is $50,000 per year. The bank applies an 80% loan-to-value ratio and a gross debt service ratio of 32%. Property taxes amount to $1,800 per year. Assume that the lender demands a 25-year amortization period and monthly payments at a contract rate of j2 = 4.2%.

"Question 599: Jennifer Joseph has lived alone in an apartment since the death of her husband 10 years ago. She has just turned 60 years of age, retired from her job as a bus driver, and wants to begin gardening as a hobby to fill in her retirement years. She has found a small house that is selling at a price she can afford because it is the only residential property in an area of commercial development. The present owners, who are anxious to sell, have lived in the house for about 20 years and have developed a magnificent garden, which appeals very much to Mrs. Joseph; however, she is worried about having enough retirement income to meet the mortgage payments and the property tax payments if she uses all of her savings as a down payment. Which one of the following statements is TRUE? 
(1)Mrs. Joseph should apply for a reverse annuity mortgage (RAM) because a RAM will require lower mortgage payments than a conventional mortgage. 
(2)After Mrs. Joseph’s purchase, the property will continue to have an assessed value for real property tax purposes, which is based on its value as a residential property. 
(3)Mrs. Joseph may make application to defer payment of the net property tax under the regular program for as many years as she owns and resides in the house. 
(4)If Mrs. Joseph becomes an owner-occupier, the home owner grants will allow reduction of her taxes to no more than $350.","Answer: 3 Explanation: Option (3) is correct because British Columbia’s regular tax deferral program will allow Mrs. Joseph to make an application to defer up to 100% of the net property taxes payable on the property, since it will be here principal place of residence. Assuming that Mrs. Joseph is either a Canadian citizen or a permanent resident, and that she would have a minimum equity of 25% in the property if she purchased it, she would likely qualify for the regular program given that she is both 55 and a widow. Option (1) is incorrect because a reverse annuity mortgage is a type of mortgage that can function to supplement the income of aged persons who already own their home, not as a way to reduce mortgage payments where a new home is being purchased. Option (2) is incorrect because the property is the only residential property in an area of commercial development. While section 19(8) of the Assessment Act permits certain residential properties to be assessed according to the value based solely on their current residential use, Mrs. Joseph would not qualify for this special assessment because she has not lived continuously in the residence for ten years. Option (4) is incorrect because Mrs. Joseph would only qualify for the basic home owner grant, which cannot be used to reduce total property taxes below $350.00."

(2)A soft change to the metric standard of measurement 
(3)A switch to the imperial standard of measurement

(1)Convection 
(2)Combustion 
(3)Collection

The house next door is similar in all respects except for the number of bedrooms and square footage. The 2,500 square foot comparable sold for $225,800 and has 3 bedrooms. If the market value of a bedroom is $3,200 and above an 1,800 sq. ft. benchmark, each 100 sq. ft. is worth $6,000, it can be concluded that the adjusted sale price of this comparable is:

(2)$216,600 
(3)$223,000 
(4)$235,000","Answer: 3 Explanation: To find the adjusted sale price of the comparable, take the sum of the listed sale price with its adjustments to the subject property. In this case, the subject property and the comparable are identical except that the subject property has 1 additional bedroom and 100 square feet less. The adjusted sale price is: $225,800 + $3,200 –$6,000 = $223,000."
"Question 604: In the comparative approach, it is MOST important that the subject building and the comparable buildings be: 
(1)recently constructed of average quality construction. 
(2)of the same general architectural style. 
(3)similar with respect to factors judged important by buyers and sellers. 
(4)inclusive of similar types and quality of fixtures.","Answer: 3 Explanation: Option (3) is correct because in the comparative approach of appraisal, it is most important that the subject building and the comparable buildings be similar with respect to factors judged important by buyers and sellers. Options (1), (2), and (4) are incorrect because similarity is only required for those factors that have a major influence on buyers and sellers, and the sale prices they negotiate."

(1)Costs will decrease. 
(2)Market value will increase. 
(3)Development will stop. 
(4)The style of new housing will be changed to reflect the increased costs.","Answer: 3 Explanation: Option (3) is correct because if the cost of developing houses is greater than their market value, development will stop in the short run until market values rise. Options (1), (2), and (4) are incorrect because they do not describe the short run effects of an increase in the cost of developing houses."

(1)Vacancy rates are expressed as a percentage of gross potential revenue. 
(2)Vacancy rates must be those existing at the time of the appraisal for the subject property. 
(3)Vacancy rates are needed because the 100% occupancy assumption of gross potential revenue is unrealistic for most properties. 
(4)Vacancy rates must be deducted from gross potential revenue.","Answer: 2 Explanation: Option (2) is correct (false) because the vacancy allowance should be determined by the long-term vacancy rates in the area; that is, the vacancies in comparable buildings modified, if necessary, by expected future trends. Options (1), (3), and (4) are incorrect because they are true."
"Question 608: Which one of the following is termed functional incurable depreciation in a building? 
(1)Worn carpeting 
(2)No air conditioning 
(3)Narrow hallways

"Question 609: Which of the following is NOT an effective way for a licensee to communicate the value of their services in a listing presentation? 
(1)Pay attention to details in the presentation, as this can provide evidence of performance. 
(2)Refrain from discussing the marketing program for the property, as this is considered proprietary information. 
(3)Turn intangibles into tangibles by including photos, virtual walk-throughs, or client testimonials. 
(4)Clearly spell out the services and benefits that are being offered.","Answer: 2 Explanation: Option (2) is the correct answer: explaining the marketing program during a listing presentation will help a client understand what benefits the licensee is providing. Options (1), (3), and (4) are all ways that a licensee can effectively communicate the value of their services to a potential client in a listing presentation."
"Question 610: Which of the following types of software is used to compute listing searches, produce automated hot sheets, and generate Comparative Market Analysis presentations? 
(1)Forms software 
(2)Back office management software

(1)Submit personal financial statements for each licensee they intend to hire 
(2)Have provided real estate services within British Columbia or an equivalent jurisdiction for 2 out of the 5 years preceding the application 
(3)Have 3 years’ licensed experience in British Columbia 
(4)All of the above","Answer: 2 Explanation: Option (2) is correct because a licensee is required to meet the educational and experience requirement appropriate to the level of licence for which the application is made. In addition to meeting the educational requirements for a representative licence, to qualify for a managing broker’s licence, a person must have been providing real estate services British Columbia or an equivalent jurisdiction for at least two years during the five years before the date of the application. Option (1) is incorrect because, while brokerages are required to keep certain specified financial records (section 25 of RESA), persons applying for managing broker’s licences do not need to submit personal financial statements for each licensee they intend to hire. Option (3) is incorrect because, as mentioned previously, an applicant’s licensed experience can come from British Columbia or an equivalent jurisdiction.

"Question 612: Alan recently assisted Peter in the sale of Peter’s house. What are the legal consequences of his doing so? 
(1)Unless he is licensed, Alan has breached the Real Estate Services Act. 
(2)If Alan is unlicensed, but performed the service without receiving or expecting any money or reward, he has done nothing wrong. 
(3)As long as Alan was not involved in the writing of the contract of purchase and sale, he may act for Peter and receive money for it. 
(4)If Alan is unlicensed, but he is Peter’s brother, Peter can pay him for the work and no breach has occurred.","Answer: 2 Explanation: Option (2) is correct because the Real Estate Services Act requires that a person who provides “real estate services” on behalf of another for or in expectation of remuneration must be licensed. There is no licensing requirement for persons like Alan, who perform real estate services without receiving or expecting any money or reward. Option (1) is incorrect for the same reason. Option (3) is incorrect because “real estate services” are not limited to the writing of the contract of purchase and sale. The Real Estate Services Act defines “real estate services” as including actions such as advising on the appropriate price for real estate, making representations about a property, finding a party to acquire real estate, showing the real estate, and negotiating the price of real estate. Therefore, Alan may not perform any of these services (or any other service included in the definition of “trading services”) and receive money for it. Option (4) is incorrect because siblings are not exempt from the licensing requirement established by section 3 of the Real Estate Services Act. Therefore, if Alan is unlicensed, Peter cannot pay him for providing real estate services."
"Question 613: Which of the following statements regarding joint tenancy is FALSE? 
(1)Where a husband and wife own property in joint tenancy and one of them dies, the other becomes the owner of the whole interest. 
(2)Where a joint tenant transfers their interest to a third party, the third party becomes a tenant in common with the original joint tenant. 
(3)Where a husband and wife own property as tenants in common and one of them dies, the other becomes the owner of the whole interest. 
(4)A joint tenancy becomes a tenancy in common upon severance.","Answer: 3 Explanation: Option (3) is correct because there is no right of survivorship in a tenancy in common. Therefore, where two people own property as tenants in common, they each may leave their interest by will to whomever they wish. Option (1) is incorrect because the essential feature of joint tenancy is the right of survivorship. This means that when one joint tenant dies, the property automatically vests in the surviving joint tenant(s). Option (2) is incorrect because all joint tenants must receive their interests at the same time and from the same document. Therefore, if one joint tenant transfers his interest to a third party, both the unity of time and the unity of title are destroyed, and the co-ownership is converted to a tenancy in common. Option (4) is incorrect for the same reason."
"Question 614: Under the Torrens System of land registration in British Columbia, if property is registered in favour of a trustee, this is shown by which of the following? 
(1)Registering a caveat against the title 
(2)Registering a lis pendens against the title 
(3)A notation of trust on the title 
(4)Issuing the trustee a duplicate certificate of title","Answer: 3 Explanation: Option (3) is correct because British Columbia does not have a pure Torrens system of title registration, and therefore allows a notation of trust to be made on the title. In a pure Torrens system, no mention of a trust can appear on the register. Option (1) is incorrect because a caveat is a short-term notice registered against a title to land warning those looking at the title that a claim for an estate or interest in the property has been made. Option (2) is incorrect because a lis pendens is a term previously used for what is now called a certificate of pending litigation. Option (4) is incorrect because issuing a duplicate certificate of title does nothing to show that the property is registered in favour of a trustee."
"Question 615: Mark, an experienced real estate licensee, showed a home in Lion’s Bay to John, who was a first-time home buyer. John asked Mark whether the house had termites. It was located in forested area and John told Mark that he was afraid that this location might have termite infestation problems. Mark told him that there were no termite infestation problems in the house. After the sale was completed, John discovered that the house had a serious termite problem, which would cost a considerable amount to repair. On what grounds might Mark be liable to John in a lawsuit? 
(1)Occupier’s liability 
(2)Private nuisance 
(3)Negligent misrepresentation 
(4)Vicarious liability","Answer: 3 Explanation: Option (3) is correct because the four requirements for an action for negligent misrepresentation are met: (1) Mark made an untrue statement when he told John that there was no termite problem; (2) the statement was likely negligent because, assuming that Mark was not outright lying, he failed to ascertain the necessary information regarding the termites before telling John that there was no infestation; (3) as an experienced professional giving advice to a person (John) who would reasonably rely on that advice, Mark owed John a duty of care; and (4) given the position of Mark, a real estate licensee showing a home, it was likely reasonable for John to rely on Mark’s statement. Since these four elements are likely met, Mark is likely liable to John for the repairs on the grounds of negligent misrepresentation. Option (1) is incorrect because John did not suffer loss while Mark was showing him the home. Option (2) is incorrect because private nuisance occurs where an owner or occupier of land unreasonably or substantially interferes with the reasonable use and enjoyment of a neighbouring property. Option (4) is incorrect because vicarious liability is the principle that renders employers liable for wrongful acts committed by their employees. In this case, vicarious liability may render Mark’s real estate brokerage liable for his negligent misrepresentation."
"Question 616: Which of the following statements is TRUE with respect to security deposits in a commercial tenancy? 
(1)The interest that accrues on a security deposit is always paid to the account of the landlord. 
(2)Someone who purchases the property from the landlord is obligated to repay the security deposit to the tenant. 
(3)The amount of a security deposit may be freely negotiated between the two parties to a commercial lease. 
(4)All of the above","Answer: 3 Explanation: Option (3) is correct because there are no legal restrictions regarding security deposits in commercial tenancies. This amount is left open to negotiation. Option (1) is incorrect because the allocation of interest on security deposits in commercial tenancies is open for negotiation, and therefore may be allocated to the tenant. Additionally, the Residential Tenancy Act and the Residential Tenancy Regulation require that the landlord pay interest on a security deposit to the tenant upon termination of the tenancy. Option (2) is incorrect because, in commercial tenancies, the return of a security deposit is a personal obligation of the landlord. A purchaser is under no duty to the tenant to repay it. In residential tenancies a security deposit, and the obligation of the landlord to repay it (with interest), runs with the land. Therefore, assuming the tenancy continues after the property is transferred, the purchaser will be required to pay these amounts out to the tenant when the tenancy ends. Option (4) is incorrect because Options (1) and (2) are incorrect."
"Question 617: Which of the following statements about bare land strata developments is TRUE? 
(1)A typical way for a developer to ensure that the houses built within the strata lots have a uniform appearance is through a series of corresponding easement agreements affecting each lot. 
(2)Within a bare land strata development, title to the roads is always transferred to the local municipality on completion, so that the municipality will be responsible for the costs of maintenance and repairs. 
(3)Bare land strata developments are typically only used for residential or recreational properties. 
(4)The owners of bare land strata lots will be responsible for the costs associated with the common property of the development, which may include outdoor recreational facilities such as lakes or trails.","Answer: 4 Explanation: Option (4) is correct because the owners in a bare land strata development will be responsible for any costs associated with common property. Recreational facilities are frequently built as common property on a bare land strata development. Option (1) is incorrect because uniform appearance is typically ensured through registered building schemes and strata bylaws, rather than easement agreements. Option (2) is incorrect because title to the land on which roads are placed can be retained by the strata corporation as common property, such that the owners of the strata lots would be responsible for maintenance and repair. Option (3) is incorrect because bare land strata developments, aside from being for residential and recreational development, are often also used for industrial and commercial development."
"Question 618: Which of the following is/are TRUE regarding listing contracts? 
(1)The purchaser can rely on the terms in the listing contract. 
(2)The listing contract must be signed by all persons who have an ownership interest in the property being sold. 
(3)If the licensee includes the terms “approximately” or “more or less” when describing the property, the licensee does not have to perform a title search. 
(4)All of the above","Answer: 2 Explanation: Option (2) is correct because, if a property is to be listed and then sold, all persons who have an ownership interest in the property must agree to the listing. Therefore, it is essential that the listing contract is signed by all of the owners. Option (1) is incorrect because the purchaser is not party to the listing contract, and therefore cannot rely on any of the terms within it. Option (3) is incorrect because a licensee who does not review the title of the listed property assumes the risk of liability to the purchaser, loss of commission, and disciplinary proceedings if a complaint is registered with the British Columbia Financial Services Authority. This remains true even if the licensee includes terms such as “approximately” or “more or less” when describing a property. Option (4) is incorrect because Options (1) and (3) are incorrect."
"Question 619: An agent will be personally liable to third parties: 
(1)whenever the agent contracts on behalf of a principal. 
(2)where the agent fails to disclose that they are an agent. 
(3)where the agent has no written authority. 
(4)in all of the above circumstances.","Answer: 2 Explanation: Option (2) is correct because at common law there are three situations where an agent will be personally liable to a third party. One of these situations is where the agent fails to disclose that he/she is an agent. Option (1) is incorrect because an agent will generally not be personally liable to third parties provided that the agent: (a) discloses their status as an agent; (b) has authority to act as an agent; and (c) does not commit any torts. Option (3) is incorrect because an agent may be granted authority from the principal orally, or by implication in certain cases. In either of these situations, the agent will possess legitimate authority and will not be personally liable to third parties merely for the reason do not have written authority. Option (4) is incorrect because Options (1) and (3) are incorrect."
"Question 620: Victoria has agreed to sell her home to Penny for $140,000. Property taxes of $2,300 have been assessed and were paid in full by Victoria on July 15. There is an outstanding late payment penalty of $85, which Victoria has not yet paid. The adjustment and possession date is December 28. It is NOT a leap year. Penny’s share of the property taxes will appear on her own statement of adjustments as:

(2)a credit of $18.90. 
(3)a debit of $25.21. 
(4)a debit of $18.90.","Answer: 3 Explanation: Option (3) is correct because, since Victoria (the seller) has already paid the full year’s property taxes, Penny (the buyer) should reimburse Victoria for the portion of the taxes from and including the adjustment date up to the end of the year. In this case, Penny’s share of the year’s property taxes (Dec. 28 – Dec. 31 = 4 days) is calculated in the following manner: 4/365 × $2,300 = $25.21. This amount will appear as a debit on Penny’s statement of adjustments. The late payment penalty incurred by Victoria will not be reflected on Penny’s statement of adjustments because it was Victoria’s responsibility to pay the property taxes on time. Therefore, Options (1), (2), and (4) are incorrect."
"Question 621: Vivian has agreed to sell her home to Peggy for $140,000. Peggy has saved up $15,000, which she paid to her brokerage as a deposit. In addition, she has obtained $92,000 in new mortgage financing from her bank. Conveyancing fees of $690 and a mortgage administration fee of $250 are payable by Peggy. Vivian is paying a 6% real estate commission to her real estate brokerage. The adjustment and possession date is December 28. Vivian has agreed to take back a short term mortgage in the amount of $8,000 in order to help Peggy finance the purchase. In addition, the conveyancer will be discharging the existing mortgage on title, which has an outstanding balance of $12,000. Finally, property taxes of $2,300 have been assessed and were paid in full by Vivian on July 15. These taxes are to be adjusted between the parties. There is an outstanding late payment penalty of $85, which Vivian has not yet paid. No one is entitled to a home owner grant, and, as no exemptions apply, Peggy will be responsible for paying the property transfer tax on completion. Assume that it is NOT a leap year and Peggy is NOT a foreign entity for property transfer tax purposes. The cash proceeds of the sale which will be received by Vivian are: 
(1)$111,540.21 
(2)$140,025.21 
(3)$111,533.90 
(4)$111,515.21","Answer: 1 Explanation: Seller’s Statement of Adjustments (Vivian) ITEM DEBIT CREDIT Purchase Price 140,000.00 Commission 8,400.00 Take Back Mortgage 8,000.00 Outstanding Mortgage 12,000.00 Buyer's Share of Taxes* 25.21 Penalty 85.00 Cash Proceeds of Sale** 111,540.21 _________ 140,025.21 140,025.21 * (Dec. 28-Dec. 31 = 4 days) 4/365  $2,300 = $25.21 ** Because the total Debits and Credits must balance, in order to find the Proceeds of Sale, you must first calculate the total Credits ($140,025.21) and then subtract the known Debits. The result is the balance of cash that the seller can expect to receive after all outstanding expenses relating to the property have been paid."
"Question 622: Valentina has agreed to sell her home to Petra for $140,000. Petra has saved up $15,000, which she paid to her brokerage as a deposit. The deposit will appear: 
(1)as a debit on Petra’s statement and a credit on Valentina’s statement. 
(2)as a credit on Petra’s statement only. 
(3)as a credit on both parties’ statements. 
(4)as a credit on Petra’s statement and a debit on Valentina’s statement.","Answer: 2 Explanation: Option (2) is correct. When a deposit is paid to a real estate brokerage, the amount of the deposit will be reflected on the buyer’s statement of adjustments as a credit. It will not appear on the seller’s statement of adjustments, therefore Options (1), (3), and (4) are incorrect."
"Question 623: Bernadette has agreed to purchase Steve’s home for $438,000. However, before the sale completes, she discovers that she has been the subject of an innocent misrepresentation that materially affects the contract. Bernadette may go to court and ask for the application of which of the following legal principles? 
(1)Revocation 
(2)Rectification 
(3)Rescission 
(4)None of the above","Answer: 3 Explanation: Option (3) is correct because, where a contract has not been executed, the available remedy for innocent misrepresentation is rescission (cancellation of the contract). Option (1) is incorrect because revocation refers to the cancellation of an offer. Once a contract has been made, revocation is no longer available. Option (2) is incorrect because rectification is a remedy typically available where there has been a mistake leading to the formation of a contract, not for misrepresentation. Option (4) is incorrect because Option (3) is correct."
"Question 624: On January 1, Abdul placed an advertisement on CQXR radio station offering squash lessons for $30 per hour. Lois heard the ad and phoned Abdul on January 3 and said “I want to take squash lessons but I’m a student, do you give a lower rate to students?” Abdul said that he only had one rate of $30 per hour. Lois said she would phone back. On January 5, Lois phoned Abdul and said she accepted Abdul’s offer. Which of the following statements concerning Abdul and Lois is true? 
(1)The January 1 advertisement was an offer, which Lois accepted on January 5. 
(2)The January 1 advertisement was an offer and Lois’ telephone call on January 3 was a counter-offer. 
(3)Lois’ January 3 call was a request for information and Abdul’s response on January 3 was an offer. 
(4)Lois’ January 3 call was a counter-offer and Abdul’s response on January 3 was a second counteroffer.","Answer: 3 Explanation: Option (3) is correct because, in the context of Lois’ inquiry regarding the possibility of a lower rate, Abdul statement that his rate was $30 per hour was an offer. This was a valid offer because it contained the necessary terms for a contract to be entered into; in this case, price ($30 per hour) and subject matter (squash lessons). Option (1) is incorrect because the advertisement was most likely an invitation to treat, used by Abdul to induce radio listeners to pursue a contract for tennis lessons with him. Option (2) is incorrect for the same reason, and for the reason that Lois’ call was merely an inquiry regarding the possibility of a lower rate for students. Lois did not propose a new rate, therefore, he did not make a counter-offer. Option (4) is incorrect for the same reason."
"Question 625: Which of the following statements regarding limited partnerships is TRUE? 
(1)Each limited partner is personally liable for all debts that the partnership incurs. 
(2)A limited partner can actively be engaged in managing the business without any consequences to their partnership status. 
(3)Income is taxed before it is distributed to the partners. 
(4)There must be one or more general partners.","Answer: 4 Explanation: Option (4) is correct because there must be at least one general partner in a limited partnership. The general partner(s) have unlimited liability, and can engage in the management or operations of the partnership. Options (1), (2), and (3) are all incorrect statements."
"Question 626: In a single-storey house, joists are horizontal framing members that support which of the following? 
(1)Rafters 
(2)The foundation only 
(3)Floors 
(4)The foundation and ceilings",Answer: 3 Explanation: Option (3) is correct because joists are the horizontal framing members that support the floors. Option (1) is incorrect because joists do not support rafters. Options (2) and (4) are incorrect as the foundation is the poured concrete footprint that supports the superstructure above.
"Question 627: Which of the following situations are consistent with the existence of a joint tenancy under current British Columbia law? 
(1)Herman was a co-owner of Blueacre. When Herman died, the surviving co-owners of Blueacre automatically became its only co-owners. 
(2)Joan and Anna are co-owners of Greenacre. The document transferring the property to them does not expressly state how they hold the property or what interest each owns. 
(3)Paul, a co-owner of Blackacre together with Peggy, transferred his interest in the property to his son and registered the transfer in the land title office. Paul’s son is now a co-owner together with Peggy. 
(4)Bert and Ernest are co-owners of Whiteacre. The front half of the property is Bert’s and the back half is owned by Ernest.","Answer: 1 Explanation: Option (1) is correct because an essential feature of joint tenancy is the right of survivorship. This means that when one joint tenant dies, the entire estate automatically vests in the surviving joint tenants. Option (2) is incorrect because, in British Columbia, the default form of co-ownership is tenancy in common, not joint tenancy. This means that if a document transfers a property without expressly stating the type of co-ownership, the new owners will be presumed to hold the property as tenants in common. Option (3) is incorrect because Paul severed the joint tenancy when he transferred his interest to his son and registered it at the land title office. This act converted the co-ownership of the property into a tenancy in common. Option (4) is incorrect because joint tenants enjoy a unity of possession, meaning that each co-owner is entitled to possession of the whole of the estate and no joint tenant can hold possession of any part separately and to the exclusion of others."

"Question 629: Three years ago Jim bought a house, at which time he arranged a mortgage for $120,000. The loan was written at a rate of 6.75% per annum compounded semi-annually, calling for monthly payments of $822.06 and an outstanding balance of $108,904.49 due at the end of the 5-year term. Jim has just received an offer from Alice to buy his house. Alice’s offer consists of $25,000 cash and assumption of the existing financing for the remainder of the term. If current lending rates for 2-year term mortgages are 8.75% per annum, compounded semi-annually, what is the market value of Alice’s offer?

"Question 632: A borrower who makes accelerated biweekly payments: 
(1)will make a smaller number of payments in a calendar year than a borrower who makes constant monthly payments (all other loan terms being equal). 
(2)will pay more interest over the life of the loan than a borrower who makes constant monthly payments (all other loan terms being equal). 
(3)pays one-twelfth of the annual payment every two weeks. 
(4)pays one-half of the monthly payment every two weeks.","Answer: 4 Explanation: Option (4) is correct because the accelerated biweekly payment is calculated as the monthly payment divided in half; instead of paying once a month, one-half of the monthly payment is paid every two weeks. Since the effect of the accelerated biweekly payments allows the borrower to make the equivalent of one extra monthly payment, the borrower will pay less interest over the loan and make a larger number of payments in a calendar year than with a constant monthly repayment schedule. Option (1) is incorrect because the borrower will make more monthly payments in a calendar year than a borrower who makes constant monthly payments. Option (2) is incorrect because the borrower will pay less interest over the life of the loan than a borrower who makes constant monthly payments. Option (3) is incorrect because the borrower pays one-half of the monthly payment every two weeks. This amounts to one-twenty-fourth of the annual payment, since one-twelfth of the annual payment is equivalent to the monthly payment."
"Question 633: An estimate of gross potential rents is achieved by: 
(1)comparing all rents for similar space. 
(2)comparing rents for recently leased similar space. 
(3)projecting future rental increases. 
(4)totalling current rents in the subject building.","Answer: 2 Explanation: Option (2) is correct because when estimating gross potential rents, the appraiser should have a sound knowledge of the current market rents for various types of accommodation, as gross potential rent is estimated using the market rents for recently leased similar space. Options (1), (3), and (4) are therefore incorrect."
"Question 634: You are determining the market value of a subject property using the capitalization process.

"Question 635: Which of the following refers to communication with employees, stockholders, clients, and the general public, with the aim of enhancing the image and reputation of a business? 
(1)Sales promotion 
(2)Undifferentiated marketing 
(3)Public relations 
(4)Target theory","Answer: 3 Explanation: Option (3) is correct because public relations refers to communications (other than personal selling and advertising) for the purpose of enhancing the image, recognition, and reputation of the firm. These communications can be with employees, stockholders, clients, and the general public. Option (1) is incorrect because sales promotion refers to any form of non-personal selling that does not fall under the head of public relations, advertising, or publicity. Option (2) is incorrect because undifferentiated marketing is a practice of marketing a product or service, not enhancing the general image and reputation of a business. Option (4) is incorrect because target theory is concerned with which group(s) a business focuses their marketing efforts on, and does not directly involve enhancing the general image and reputation of the business."

(1)Land that is reasonably necessary for the use and enjoyment of the complex as a place of residence 
(2)A detached home in which a family resides 
(3)A condominium unit being rented out to a university student on a year-long lease 
(4)A home that is used for short-term rentals on Airbnb","Answer: 4 Explanation: Option (4) is correct because, although the definition of a residential complex includes most dwelling-units, a home which is used for short-term rentals would likely be considered a dwelling unit akin to a hotel, and thus would be excluded from the definition of a residential complex under the Excise Tax Act. Option (1) is incorrect because the residential complex definition includes land that is reasonably necessary for the use and enjoyment of the complex as a place of residence. Options (2) and (3) are incorrect because the definition of residential complex includes detached homes and condominiums used as dwelling houses which do not fall under the “hotel” exception."
"Question 638: Your client, Bard, is a developer who owns land in an area zoned for single family residences. He wants to subdivide his 2.5 acre lot and build two 24 unit condominium projects on the land. Bard seeks your expert advice about how to overcome the land use bylaw obstacles that could prohibit the land development. You correctly advise Bard that: 
(1)Bard will have to apply for a legal non-conforming use permit for this development site, according to the process outlined in the Local Government Act. 
(2)a public hearing must be held by the municipal council prior to a change in the permitted land use or density under a zoning bylaw. 
(3)the municipal council has the power, after a public hearing has been held, to alter an amended bylaw to further change the use or density of a zone without holding another public hearing, so long as it is in the public’s best interests to make this further change. 
(4)All of the above statements are true.","Answer: 2 Explanation: Option (2) is correct because, in order to subdivide his lot and build two condominium projects, Bard will need the municipal council or regional district to pass a new bylaw amending the current zoning bylaw. To pass a bylaw changing the permitted use or density of the zone, a public hearing must be held to give persons whose interest in property would be affected an opportunity to be heard. Option (1) is incorrect because a legal non-conforming use refers to land use that is impermissible under current zoning restrictions, but which is nevertheless lawful because the use existed lawfully before the restrictions took effect. One cannot apply for a legal non-conforming use exemption for the purposes of converting a property to a use currently prohibited by an existing bylaw. Option (3) is incorrect because, in order to further change the use or density of a zone, the municipal council must hold another public hearing. Option (4) is incorrect because Options (1) and (3) are incorrect."
"Question 639: There are several steps taken before a lawsuit actually is brought before a judge. Which of the following procedures does NOT take place before a trial begins? 
(1)Filing and serving a notice of civil claim 
(2)Filing and serving a response to civil claim 
(3)Conducting an examination for discovery 
(4)Obtaining a garnishing order","Answer: 4 Explanation: Option (4) is correct because a garnishing order may only be obtained either during or after a lawsuit (depending on the circumstances), but never before the lawsuit has been brought before a judge. Option (1) is incorrect because a notice of civil claim outlines the details of a plaintiff’s claim, and is served to the defendant before the claim is actually brought before a judge. Option (2) is incorrect because a response to civil claim is the defendant’s initial written reply to the notice of civil claim, and it is also filed and served before the claim is brought before a judge. Option (3) is incorrect because discovery proceedings are a means for bringing out the relevant evidence before the case gets to trial."
"Question 640: All other things being equal, the type of loan with the most risk to the lender is: 
(1)an interest accruing loan. 
(2)an interest only loan. 
(3)a straight line principal reduction loan. 
(4)a constant, blended payment loan.","Answer: 1 Explanation: Option (1) is correct because with an interest accruing loan, the lender receives no payments before the maturity of the loan. This means that the entire loan amount and the interest accrued is at risk throughout the entire term of the loan, making it the most risky of the four types of loans in this question, all other things being equal. Option (2) is incorrect because an interest only loan is less risky because the borrower contracts to make regular payments of the interest earned to the lender throughout the term of the loan. Options (3) and (4) are incorrect because, with both of these loans, the lender receives periodic payments of both the principal amount and interest throughout the term of the loan."
"Question 641: Assume that it is not a leap year. A property is sold on the following terms: Price: $195,000 (cash) Commission: 5% on the first $100,000 of the sale price and 2½% on the balance. Adjustment, possession, and completion date: August 28. Taxes for the current year were paid by the seller on July 1 in the amount of $1,015. The buyer has paid a deposit of $20,000 legal fees for the conveyance amount to $491. Where would the tax adjustment appear on the Statements of Adjustment? 
(1)As a credit on the Seller’s Statement and a debit on the Buyer’s Statement 
(2)As a credit on the Buyer’s Statement and a debit on the Seller’s Statement 
(3)As a credit on both statements 
(4)As a debit on both statements","Answer: 1 Explanation: Option (1) is correct because property taxes are paid on July 1, therefore, they have been paid by the seller. When property taxes have been paid by the seller, the buyer should reimburse the seller for that portion of the year from and including the adjustment date. The tax adjustment will appear as a credit on the seller’s statement and a debit on the buyer’s statement. Options (2), (3), and (4) are therefore incorrect."
"Question 642: Where a licensee is personally involved in a real estate sale, which of the following is NOT a part of the disclosure requirements under the Real Estate Services Act ? 
(1)The licensee must disclose that they, or an associated company or partnership, are purchasing the property on their own behalf. 
(2)The licensee must disclose that they, or an associated company or partnership, are selling their own property. 
(3)The licensee must disclose any other properties currently under consideration by the licensee. 
(4)The licensee must make the required disclosure in writing, in the required form, prior to entering into any agreement.","Answer: 3 Explanation: Option (3) is correct because the British Columbia Real Estate Services Act does not require licensees to disclose any other properties that they are considering. Options (1), (2), and (4) are incorrect because section 53 of the Real Estate Services Rules requires licensees who are selling or purchasing real estate on their own behalf to make a written disclosure of their personal interest in the transaction to the other party."
"Question 643: Which of the following is NOT a commonly used financial statement? 
(1)A statement of profit and loss 
(2)An income statement

"Question 646: All other things being equal, a selling price less than the market value of a property is most likely to be obtained in a sale when: 
(1)real estate prices are increasing very quickly. 
(2)the seller is not in a hurry to sell. 
(3)the buyer is in a hurry to buy. 
(4)the property has been exposed to the market for more than two months.","Answer: 1 Explanation: Option (1) is correct because when real estate prices are increasing very quickly, they are reflecting the increasing market values of properties. The selling price would therefore likely be lower than the actual market value in a time of rapidly increasing real estate prices. Options (2) is incorrect because if a seller is not in a hurry to sell, he or she is likely to wait to obtain the highest possible price. Option (3) is incorrect because a buyer who is in a hurry to buy may pay a premium to acquire a property. Option (4) is incorrect because a property that has been exposed to the market for more than two months does not necessarily indicate that the sale price will be lower than the market value, as the market could fluctuate in many ways throughout the two months."
"Question 647: A local mortgage broker arranged a mortgage in the amount of $210,000. The borrower has agreed to pay a brokerage fee in the amount of $7,200 that is to be added to the loan amount, giving a face value of $217,200 for the loan. The mortgage bears interest at a contract rate of 6.5% per annum, compounded semi-annually. The mortgage has an amortization period and term of 20 years and calls for monthly payments.

(4)$76,888","Answer: 1 Explanation: Max loan = Lending value × Loan-to-value ratio Max loan = $363,000 × 0.80 Max loan = $290,400 This is the amount of their mortgage. The question asks for the down payment. If the purchase price is $365,000, and the mortgage is $290,400, then the down payment is equal to the difference of $74,600 ($365,000  $290,400)."
"Question 651: Which of the following statements regarding electrical service is FALSE? 
(1)If the home is less than 25 years old, the size of the main breaker usually determines the service. 
(2)The wires to most homes carry 120/240 volt, 3-wire electrical service. 
(3)The Canadian Electrical Code requires that new or substantially renovated houses of more than 80 square metres have a service capacity of at least 100 amps. 
(4)Voltage is a measure of power or consumption.","Answer: 4 Explanation: Option (4) is correct because voltage is a measure of electrical potential, not power or consumption. Options (1), (2), and (3) are true statements."
"Question 652: The process used in underwriting income-producing properties is similar to that for residential borrower qualification except that in underwriting commercial properties: 
(1)a loan-to-value constraint is never used. 
(2)the income from the property is more important than the personal income of the borrower. 
(3)a gross debt service ratio is commonly employed. 
(4)a safety margin is not necessary.","Answer: 2 Explanation: Option (2) is correct because lenders are more interested in the income generated from the commercial property than the borrower’s personal income. Options (1), (3), and (4) are incorrect because they do not describe differences between underwriting income-producing properties and residential borrower qualification."
"Question 653: A board of variance is a board established to: 
(1)ensure that actions by municipalities are not at variance with the Local Government Act. 
(2)settle boundary line disputes between private parties. 
(3)ensure that all non-conforming uses cease within six months after a change in a zoning bylaw. 
(4)permit a minor deviation from a zoning bylaw for an individual property owner.",Answer: 4 Explanation: Option (4) is correct because a board of variance must be established by every local government that has adopted a zoning bylaw to ensure that the bylaw does not cause undue hardship. A board of variance may grant minor variances from zoning bylaws where compliance would cause undue hardship provided that the variance would not conflict with the policies of the local government. Option (1) is incorrect because boards of variance do not enforce municipality compliance with the Local Government Act. Option (2) is incorrect because boards of variance do not settle boundary line disputes between private parties. Option (3) is incorrect because legal non-conforming uses may be permitted to exist for more than six months.
"Question 654: Which of the following is a liability on a financial statement? 
(1)Accumulated depreciation 
(2)Inventory 
(3)Rent receivable 
(4)Accounts payable","Answer: 4 Explanation: Option (4) is correct because accounts payable is a liability, since it represents a debt owed. Option (1) is incorrect because accumulated depreciation will fall under the asset category of the balance sheet, and will take away from the value of the depreciable asset(s). Options (2) and (3) are incorrect because inventory and rent receivable are both current assets."
"Question 655: Jennie has rented her apartment on a month to month basis for two years without a rent increase. She receives a properly delivered rent increase notice on July 31 raising her rent from $750 per month to $1,075 per month, effective November 1. She feels this increase is excessive and discusses it with her landlord, but her landlord remains convinced that $1,075 is a fair market value rent, even though the applicable Consumer Price Index (CPI) is 3%. Which of the following statements is TRUE? 
(1)The notice of rent increase is invalid because it is less than six months before it becomes effective. 
(2)This rent increase cannot be valid or approved because it is greater than the CPI. 
(3)This rent increase will be valid only if there has been a change of landlords. 
(4)This rent increase will be valid only if approved for special circumstances as set out in the Residential Tenancy Regulations.","Answer: 4 Explanation: Option (4) is correct because the Residential Tenancy Regulation limits annual rent increases to an amount equal to the Consumer Price Index (CPI) for British Columbia (in this case, 3%). Since this rent increase exceeds this amount, it will only be valid if approved for special circumstances as set out in the Residential Tenancy Regulation. Option (1) is incorrect because written notice of a rent increase need only be given to a tenant at least three months before it becomes effective. Option (2) is incorrect because the landlord may apply for approval for this rent increase based on special circumstances. Option (3) is incorrect because a new landlord is not given the right to raise the rent above the set amount (the applicable CPI)."
"Question 656: Which of the following is a key determinant of the value of a property? 
(1)Vendor financing 
(2)Cash-equivalent price 
(3)Listing (asking) price 
(4)Rights of ownership","Answer: 4 Explanation: Option (4) is the correct answer because the legal rights of ownership and the physical property will determine the value of a property. The listing price, Option (3), may represent the value to owner, but does not determine the actual value that the property is worth in the market. Option (1) is incorrect because vendor financing may impact the value, but is not a key determinant of value. Option (2) is incorrect because cash-equivalent price represents the market value of a property only if non-market financing was involved in a sale/purchase."
"Question 657: Where a principal adopts a contract that their agent entered into without any authority: 
(1)the third party is not obligated to honour the contract if they do not wish to. 
(2)the principal can sue the agent for breach of warranty of authority. 
(3)the agent is given authority retroactively to enter into that contract. 
(4)the agent becomes a party to that contract.","Answer: 3 Explanation: Option (3) is correct because a principal can retroactively ratify a contract which was entered into by his agent without the necessary authority. Ratification expresses the principal’s consent to be bound just as if the agent had been authorized to make the contract in the first place. Option (1) is incorrect because, if the principal ratifies the contract, the contract is valid and the third party is obligated to honour the contract. Option (2) is incorrect because a warranty of authority is an agent’s promise to third parties (not the principal) that his or her actions fall within the scope of authority given by the principal. Therefore, only third parties to whom the warranty of authority is made can sue the agent for breaching the warranty. Option (4) is incorrect because, where a principal adopts a contract which his agent entered into without any authority, the principal (not the agent) becomes a party to that contract."
"Question 658: Mr. and Mrs. Tom Jones and Ashraf Menzies have a signed contract of purchase and sale for a triplex owned by Alan Sinclair. Mr. and; Mrs. Jones have agreed to pay $100,000 each and Ashraf has agreed to pay the balance of $50,000. They would like their ownership registered as a joint tenancy. Which one of the following statements is TRUE? 
(1)Tom, Mrs. Jones, and Ashraf cannot register their ownership as a joint tenancy because they did not each contribute the same amount of cash. 
(2)If their interest is registered as a joint tenancy, Tom, Mrs. Jones, and Ashraf will each own an undivided interest in the triplex. 
(3)Tom and Mrs. Jones would be allowed to register their interests as a joint tenancy because they are husband and wife, but Ashraf would have to be a tenant-in-common with them. 
(4)Tom, Mrs. Jones, and Ashraf cannot meet the four common law principles required to create a joint tenancy.","Answer: 2 Explanation: Option (2) is correct because, in a joint tenancy, co-owners are viewed as a single legal owner against everyone else; and therefore, each owns an undivided interest in the whole of the estate. Option (1) is incorrect because individuals can enter into a joint tenancy regardless of their respective financial contributions to the purchase of the property. Option (3) is incorrect because more than two individuals can enter into a single joint tenancy and because individuals do not have to be married to enter into a joint tenancy. Option (4) is incorrect because each of the following four common law “unities” can be satisfied: (1) all joint tenants must receive their interests at the same time; (2) all joint tenants must receive their interest from the same document; (3) all joint tenants must have the same interest in the land; and (4) all joint tenants must be entitled to possession of the whole estate."
"Question 659: A friend of yours is cleaning out her real estate office and is throwing away the hard copies of all her transaction-related documents. When you ask her why, she explains that she has electronic copies of all of these documents and that they are just taking up space. Which of the following statements regarding data backup and legal considerations should your friend be aware of? 
(1)Keeping only electronic copies of transaction-related documents is advisable and hard copies are not necessary in the real estate industry. 
(2)There is no need to keep hard copies because of the use of digital signatures. 
(3)She should retain her hard copies in case there is a question as to the authenticity or origin of the electronic documents and email communications. 
(4)It is only necessary to retain hard copies of documents if they do not contain signatures or initials.","Answer: 3 Explanation: Option (3) is correct because any verification of dated communication helps to give credibility to a statement or allegation. However, verifying the authenticity of electronic documents and email communications is difficult. Further, electronic communication may not stand alone as evidence if there is a question as to the authenticity or origin of the communication. Therefore, keeping hard copies is extremely important from a legal perspective. Options (1), (2), and (4) are incorrect for the same reasons."
"Question 660: Which of the following correctly lists assets from most liquid to least liquid? 
(1)Accounts receivable, inventories, accounts payable, marketable securities 
(2)Marketable securities, accounts receivable, inventories, prepaid expenses 
(3)Cash, accounts receivable, land, marketable securities 
(4)Building, cash, prepaid expenses, inventories","Answer: 2 Explanation: Option (2) is correct because marketable securities, accounts receivable, inventories, and prepaid expenses is the correct listing of assets from most to least liquid. Option (1) is incorrect because marketable securities are more liquid than accounts receivable, and accounts payable is not an asset. Option (3) is incorrect because marketable securities are more liquid than accounts receivable, and land is the least liquid asset listed. Option (4) is incorrect because inventory is generally more liquid than prepaid expenses, and the building is the least liquid asset listed."
"Question 661: Elly, a licensed real estate representative, entered into a written exclusive listing contract with Laura to list Laura’s house for sale for $300,800. Shortly after entering into this agreement, Elly’s licence expired. Unaware of the expiration of her licence, Elly proceeded to hold three open houses and several other showings of the house, eventually finding a buyer who offered $300,800 for the house. Laura accepted the offer, but when she learned about Elly’s licence expiry, she refused to pay any commission to Elly. Which of the following statements is TRUE? 
(1)A court will not award Elly any form of remuneration in this situation. 
(2)The Real Estate Services Act permits Elly to sue Laura for commission in this situation whether or not the listing contract specified the amount Elly was to receive. 
(3)A lawsuit to recover damages against Laura for breach of the listing contract will probably succeed even if Laura later refuses to complete the sale of her house. 
(4)Based on the limited facts in this situation, the listing contract likely violates the statutory requirements of the Real Estate Services Act.","Answer: 1 Explanation: Option (1) is correct because section 4 of the Real Estate Services Act stipulates that if an agent is unlicensed at the time real estate services were provided, he or she cannot bring a court action to collect commission. Options (2) and (3) are incorrect for the same reason. Option (4) is incorrect because there is no indication, based on the facts presented in this situation, that the listing contract violates the statutory requirements of the Real Estate Services Act."
"Question 662: In which one of the following situations may the landlord choose to give the tenant one month’s notice of the end of the tenancy agreement? 
(1)Charles is renting a one-bedroom apartment in the West End of Vancouver on a month-to-month basis. He has been diligent in paying his rent on the due date each month but the landlord has recently discovered that Charles’ friend, Christine, has moved into the apartment with him. 
(2)Jordan’s warehouse is long overdue for a major renovation, which cannot be completed with the present tenant in occupation. Aladdin, the tenant, has four months left on his fixed term tenancy and does not wish to move. 
(3)On September 1, Kirsten moved into a small house owned by Jackson without paying the security deposit of $300 requested by the rental agent and according to the terms of the tenancy agreement. On September 30, she tenders $600 for the October rent but refuses to pay the additional $300 for the security deposit. 
(4)MacGregor’s son is moving to Vancouver and wants to live in an apartment that MacGregor owns and has rented out to Mrs. Julian for the last 20 years.","Answer: 3 Explanation: Option (3) is correct because, under section 47(1)(a) of the Residential Tenancy Act, a landlord may give a tenant a notice of the end of a tenancy if the tenant does not pay the security deposit within 30 days of the date it is required to be paid under the agreement. Option (1) is incorrect because, as per section 47(1)(c) of the Residential Tenancy Act, a landlord may only give a tenant notice of the end of a tenancy for reasons relating to the number of occupants if there are an “unreasonable” number of occupants in the rental unit. Two occupants in a one-bedroom apartment would not be considered unreasonable, and therefore, a landlord could not end a tenancy for this reason. Option (2) is incorrect because Jordan cannot end the tenancy early in order to renovate the warehouse. Jordan must wait until the lease term expires. Option (4) is incorrect because MacGregor must give the tenant at least 2 months’ notice in order to end Mrs. Julian’s tenancy to allow his son to move into the apartment."
"Question 663: With respect to an insured mortgage loan, which of the following statements is FALSE? 
(1)In Canadian mortgage loan insurance, the lender pays the insurer a single premium, the cost of which is generally passed on to the borrower. 
(2)Borrowers can add the mortgage loan insurance premium to the mortgage amount. 
(3)Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation (CMHC) is the only institution in Canada that provides mortgage loan insurance. 
(4)Federally regulated financial institutions require mortgage insurance in order to make loans with loan-to-value ratios higher than 80%.","Answer: 3 Explanation: Option (3) is correct (false) because there are several organizations that offer mortgage loan insurance such as CMHC, Genworth Financial Canada, and the Canada Guaranty Mortgage Insurance Company. Options (1), (2), and (4) are incorrect because they are true statements."
"Question 664: Ownership of land in British Columbia includes not only the surface of the land, but also: 
(1)the column of airspace above it insofar as the owner can see. 
(2)the gold and silver below the land to a depth of ten feet. 
(3)objects affixed to the land for the purpose of improving the land. 
(4)petroleum down to the centre of the earth.","Answer: 3 Explanation: Option (1) is incorrect because landowners in British Columbia now own or have rights in the airspace above their property only to the extent that they can make effective use of it (not insofar as the owner can see). Option (2) is incorrect because the Government of British Columbia has reserved subsurface rights to gold and silver in favour of the Crown since the time when original Crown grants were made in the 19th century. Option (4) is incorrect because subsurface rights to petroleum have also been reserved in favour of the Crown since 1899; therefore, only landowners whose property was granted by the Crown prior to this date might have ownership of subsurface petroleum (depending on the terms of the original grant)."
"Question 665: A strata plan is: 
(1)filed in the Land Title Office and designates which parts of a strata projects are strata lots and which are common property. 
(2)used for both condominium and cooperative developments. 
(3)required only when creating five or more strata lots. 
(4)essentially a package of restrictive covenants.","Answer: 1 Explanation: Option (1) is correct because an owner developer must file a strata plan in order to create a strata development. The strata plan divides the entirely of the building between strata lots and common property. Option (2) is incorrect because cooperative developments are not strata developments, and therefore have no corresponding strata plans. Option (3) is incorrect because strata plans are required for all strata developments. Option (4) is incorrect because restrictive covenants impose restrictions on the use of one person’s land for the benefit of another piece of land. A strata plan does not impose restrictions on “burdened” land for the benefit of some other “benefitted” land. [NOTE: This question has been replaced. Please review your Bulletins posted on your Course Resources webpage.]"
"Question 666: The primary purpose of a credit analysis of a mortgagor is: 
(1)to ensure that the borrower has both the ability and the intention of complying with the mortgage agreement. 
(2)to determine if the borrower is worth suing if they default on the mortgage. 
(3)to determine the exact interest rate to charge the borrower. 
(4)to appraise the value of the property given as security for the loan.","Answer: 1 Explanation: Option (1) is correct because a credit analysis evaluates an applicant’s ability to meet the terms of a mortgage and the amount of his or her available for future mortgage payments. Options (2), (3), and (4) are incorrect as they do not describe the primary purpose of a credit analysis of a mortgagor."
"Question 667: A licensee is required to provide the consumer with a Disclosure of Risks to Unrepresented Parties form if the licensee is providing trading services to the consumer as an unrepresented party in such a way that the licensee must provide a Disclosure of Representation in Trading Services form to that unrepresented party AND: 
(1)the unrepresented party is particularly vulnerable in the trade in real estate. 
(2)the licensee is also representing a client in the same trade in real estate. 
(3)the unrepresented party is not obtaining legal advice in respect of the trade in real estate. 
(4)the unrepresented party has never worked with a real estate licensee before.","Answer: 2 Explanation: Option (2) is correct because under section 55 of the Real Estate Services Rules, a licensee must provide a consumer with a Disclosure of Risks to Unrepresented Parties form when the licensee makes a disclosure under section 54 to an unrepresented party AND the licensee is also representing a client in the same trade in real estate. Options (1), (3), and (4) are incorrect because licensees are not required to make this disclosure to an unrepresented party if the licensee is not also representing a client in the same trade."
"Question 668: When a borrower is unable to make the mortgage payments (in part or full): 
(1)the lender will immediately use legal remedies to recover the outstanding amounts. 
(2)the borrower has the right to automatically adjust payment terms. 
(3)the lender cannot grant extra time to repay the deficit amounts. 
(4)it may be due to loss of employment.","Answer: 4 Explanation: Option (4) is correct because a borrower may be unable to make the mortgage payments due to a number of reasons including loss of employment. Option (1) is incorrect because when this occurs, the lender can, but may choose not to, take immediate legal action against the borrower. Options (2) and (3) are incorrect because sometimes it is in the best interest of the lender to grant extra time for the borrower to repay the deficit, but the borrower cannot automatically adjust the payment terms."
"Question 669: The consumer price index is a good method to adjust sale prices to the level of values prevailing as of the date of appraisal: 
(1)where the comparable sales are deemed to be not recent. 
(2)where there are inadequate numbers of comparable sales within a particular neighbourhood. 
(3)where the cost approach of appraisal is deemed to be inappropriate. 
(4)under no circumstances.","Answer: 4 Explanation: Option (4) is correct because general price indices, such as the consumer price index or the shelter price index, are irrelevant to the appraisal of one particular property since changes in the value of consumer products are not necessarily the same as changes in the value of property. Therefore, Options (1), (2), and (3) are incorrect."
"Question 670: An appraiser is using the market approach for an appraisal of a single-family house. By proper adjustment, the appraiser can use sale prices of all the following properties for comparison purposes, EXCEPT: 
(1)houses in different neighbourhoods. 
(2)houses with different square footage. 
(3)houses recently sold between related parties. 
(4)houses sold over six months ago.","Answer: 3 Explanation: Option (3) is correct because appraisers cannot use sale prices for houses recently sold between related parties for comparison purposes. Market value is determined by analyzing market transactions where the buyer and seller have no special relationship (i.e., the sale occurred at arm’s length) and the properties sold are similar (or comparable) to the subject property. Options (1), (2), and (4) are incorrect because with appropriate adjustment, the sale prices of all of these properties can be used for comparison purposes."
"Question 671: Wally Walters wants to determine the market value of his property. Unfortunately, he lives in a sparsely inhabited region where there are no similar properties that have recently sold. However, he does know that the replacement cost (new) of his 2,600 square foot house is $42.50 per square foot. The land value estimate using the comparative approach of appraisal is $41,500. Mr. Walters has not taken adequate care of his house and it has depreciated in value. There has been $16,300 of curable physical depreciation. In addition, the bathroom and kitchen fixtures are outdated; their replacement cost is $13,200. Based on the above information, what is the market value of Mr. Walters’ property? 
(1)$122,500 
(2)$81,000 
(3)$152,000 
(4)$135,700","Answer: 1 Explanation: Replacement cost of house: $42.50 × 2,600 = $110,500 Land: $41,500 Land + House = $152,000 minus depreciation ($16,300) = $135,700 minus bathroom kitchen fixtures ($13,200) = $122,500 The market value is $122,500."
"Question 672: You have a partially completed appraisal report that you need to fill in. The subject property has 5 bedrooms and an alarm system. The house next door is similar in all respects except for the number of bedrooms and alarm system. It recently sold for $445,500 and had a +$3,500 adjustment for bedrooms and a +$5,500 adjustment for an alarm system. If the market value of a bedroom is $3,500 and the market value of an alarm system is $5,500, it can be concluded that this comparable has: 
(1)4 bedrooms and no alarm system. 
(2)3 bedrooms and no alarm system. 
(3)4 bedrooms and an alarm system. 
(4)5 bedrooms and an alarm system.","Answer: 1 Explanation: Option (1) is correct because in relation to the subject property, this comparable has one less bedroom and no alarm system. Options (2), (3), and (4) are therefore incorrect."
"Question 673: Jonathan Wong has offered $231,000 for a house, providing he is able to obtain acceptable financing. The house lists for $242,000, but the lender has set the lending value at $238,000. The lender requires a loan-to-value ratio of 80% and a gross debt service ratio of 30%. Property taxes are $1,750 per year and Mr. Wong’s annual gross income is $65,000. If the interest rate is 6.5% per annum, compounded annually, the amortization period is 20 years, and payments are made monthly, what is the maximum amount this lender will advance, rounded to the nearest $100? 
(1)$201,300 
(2)$196,800 
(3)$215,200 
(4)$190,400","Answer: 4 Explanation: To solve this question, calculate the maximum amount of money that can be lent out given the two constraints: the loan-to-value amount and the gross debt service ratio amount. Calculate the loan amount for the loan-to-value constraint and then calculate the loan amount for the GDSR constraint. In order to determine the maximum amount that the lender will advance, choose the lesser of the two results. LTV = 80%"
"Question 674: Which of the following is NOT characteristic of a mortgage as an investment? 
(1)Smaller investors face a mortgage payment reinvestment problem. 
(2)Mortgages require a high initial outlay of capital. 
(3)Mortgages require a low degree of administrative work. 
(4)Mortgages are “unique”, which makes them difficult to trade.","Answer: 3 Explanation: Option (3) is false. Mortgages require a high degree of administrative work such as writing contracts, registering the mortgage charge, and subsequent administration of outstanding balance and refinancing. Options (1), (2), and (4) are incorrect because they are characteristics of a mortgage as an investment."
"Question 675: Cornelius gave a life tenancy to Ruel, which did not expressly state anything about Ruel’s liability for waste. Ruel will NOT be liable to the remainderman for: 
(1)permissive waste. 
(2)voluntary waste. 
(3)ameliorating waste. 
(4)equitable waste.","Answer: 1 Explanation: Option (1) is correct because, at common law, a life tenant is generally under no obligation to repair or compensate for waste that occurs as a result of allowing the property to deteriorate without any positive acts (permissive waste). Option (2) is incorrect because life tenants are liable to the remainderman for direct, positive acts that result in damage to the property beyond the use to which the life tenant is entitled (voluntary waste). Option (3) is incorrect because a life tenant is liable for direct, positive acts which improve rather than destroy the property (ameliorating waste) – but, usually no damages can be awarded, as the property has been improved. Option (4) is incorrect because a life tenant is liable for waste that he or she causes by flagrantly or maliciously damaging or destroying the property (equitable waste)."
"Question 676: Which of the following statements about depreciation expense is TRUE? 
(1)It is another name for capital cost allowance. 
(2)It is a deductible expense in computing income for purposes of income taxation. 
(3)It is usually calculated on land by the straight-line method. 
(4)It is the method used to allocate the cost of an asset over time.","Answer: 4 Explanation: Option (4) is correct because depreciation expense is used to allocate the cost of a depreciable asset over the course of its life. Option (1) is incorrect because depreciation expense is an accounting framework, whereas capital cost allowance is a taxation framework. Option (2) is incorrect because depreciation expense cannot be deducted from taxable income, whereas capital cost allowance can be. Option (3) is incorrect because land is not a depreciable asset."
"Question 677: The owner of an interest in real property that is located in British Columbia always has: 
(1)a fee simple interest. 
(2)the right to use their property in any way they choose. 
(3)at least a 99-year lease from the Crown. 
(4)common law rights as modified by legislation.","Answer: 4 Explanation: Option (4) is correct because real property ownership in British Columbia is based on English common law property rights as modified by legislation such as the Property Law Act and the Land Title Act. Option (1) is incorrect because an owner of an interest in real property in British Columbia may have a number of interests that fall short of a fee simple interest (e.g., life estate, estate pur autre vie, leasehold, etc.). Option (2) is incorrect because the extent of the usage rights enjoyed by an owner of an interest in real property depends heavily upon the type of interest that the owner holds. Additionally, even an owner of real property in fee simple must still abide by various common law restrictions as well as legislative restrictions (e.g., municipalities have the power to regulate subdivision). Option (3) is incorrect because an owner of an interest in real property in British Columbia can have an interest less than a 99-year lease from the Crown (e.g., a lease for a term of less than 99 years)."

"Question 680: In which of the following situations will the agency authority continue to exist? 
(1)Lorne lists his house for sale with Steve. The house burns down. 
(2)Lorne enters into an exclusive listing agreement with his agent Mark. Lorne then sells the property himself without Mark’s assistance. 
(3)Lorne tells his agent over the phone that he no longer has the authority to sell his house. 
(4)None of the above.","Answer: 4 Explanation: Option (4) is correct because each of the scenarios laid out in Options (1), (2), and (3) would terminate the agency authority. Option (1) is incorrect because the doctrine of frustration appears to apply to the agency relationship, meaning that if a house listed for sale burns down, the agency would probably be terminated. Option (2) is incorrect because, the moment the principal sells his or her property, he or she terminates the authority of all listing brokers, no matter what kind of listing agreement they have. The principal may, however, still be liable to pay commission. Option (3) is incorrect because either party to an agency agreement can terminate the authority (orally or by conduct) at will."

Therefore, the $3,819.68 will appear as a debit on the seller’s statement of adjustments."
"Question 682: Which of the following statements is TRUE with respect to listing contracts? 
(1)While a listing contract is a contract between the brokerage and the seller, the buyer is bound to some of the terms contained in the contract. 
(2)It is not necessary that an exclusive listing contain a specified duration or commencement date. 
(3)The open listing provides better protection for the agent than the exclusive listing. 
(4)None of the above statements is true.","Answer: 4 Explanation: Option (4) is correct because none of the previous statements is true. Option (1) is incorrect because the buyer is not privy to the listing contract, meaning that the buyer owes no rights and has no obligations under the listing contract. Option (2) is incorrect because Clause 1A of the standard form listing agreement created by the British Columbia Real Estate Association requires an “Effective Date” and an “Expiry Date”. Option (3) is incorrect because an open listing provides less protection for the agent than an exclusive listing. This is because, as opposed to an exclusive listing, an open listing does not prevent the seller from employing a number of other brokerages to represent the seller. Commission is only paid to the brokerage who is the effective cause of the eventual sale."
"Question 683: Which of the following will NOT result in the release or expiry of an offer? 
(1)The illiteracy of the offeree 
(2)The expiry of a specified time limit in the offer prior to acceptance 
(3)A counter-offer by the offeree 
(4)Revocation of the offer, communicated to the offeree by the offeror","Answer: 1 Explanation: Option (1) is correct because the general rule is that an illiterate person is bound by a contract that he or she has agreed to, unless he or she did not know the general nature of the contract. Therefore, the illiteracy of the offeree, alone, is insufficient to release an offer. Option (2) is incorrect because an offer expires if it is not accepted within the time limit specified in the offer. Option (3) is incorrect because a counter-offer constitutes a rejection of the original offer. Option (4) is incorrect because the offeror can revoke an offer at any time provided that the offeror communicates the revocation to the offeree prior to acceptance."
"Question 684: Which of the following options is an advantage of using a central, gas-fired, forced hot water heating system? 
(1)Its air filtration capabilities 
(2)The production of a steady, consistent heat 
(3)Money can be saved by leaving it off during an owner’s winter absence 
(4)Heat transmission is completely by radiation","Answer: 2 Explanation: Option (2) is correct because a central gas fired, forced hot water heating system produces steady and consistent heat. Option (1) is incorrect as this type of heating system does not provide air circulation or filtration. Option (3) is incorrect as this type of heating system must be kept circulating in cold weather otherwise water will freeze and the piping will crack. Option (4) is false because this type of heating system transmits heat through convection and radiation."
"Question 685: Which of the following could be called “legislation”? 
(1)The Land Title Act 
(2)The Principle of Specific Performance 
(3)The Equity of Redemption 
(4)All of the above","Answer: 1 Explanation: Option (1) is correct because the Land Title Act is a body of law written and passed by the provincial government of British Columbia. Option (2) is incorrect because specific performance is a remedy that was developed by the courts of equity, not enacted via government statute. Option (3) is incorrect because the equity of redemption is a doctrine that was developed by the courts of equity, not enacted via government statue. Option (4) is incorrect because Options (2) and (3) are incorrect."
"Question 686: Which one of the following is NOT a mortgagor covenant? 
(1)Pay all taxes on the land and on the improvements 
(2)Keep the premises in a reasonable state of repair 
(3)To convey the property to the mortgagee, at its option, in exchange for an amount equal to current market value 
(4)Pay the debt and accrued interest according to the agreed upon schedule","Answer: 3 Explanation: Option (3) is correct because there is a fundamental principle of mortgage law which prohibits “clogging” on “the equity of redemption”. This principle states that the borrower (or the mortgagor) cannot be prevented by the terms of the mortgage from eventually redeeming his or her property free from the conditions contained in the mortgage upon repayment of the loan. An option to purchase a mortgaged property given by the borrower to the lender at the time the mortgage is negotiated, if exercised, would prevent the mortgagor from redeeming his or her property upon repayment, and is therefore void. Option (1) is incorrect because, in mortgage agreements, mortgagors generally covenant to pay all taxes on land and the improvements. Option (2) is incorrect because it is common for a mortgagor to covenant to keep the land and buildings thereof in “good condition and repair”, thereby protecting the value of the security (the property). Option (4) is incorrect because the repayment clause of a mortgage agreement will set out the borrower’s promise to pay the debt and accrued interest according to the schedule agreed upon."
"Question 687: Which one of the following statements is TRUE? 
(1)Given that the net operating income remains constant, the market value of a property rises as the required yield rises. 
(2)The market value of an income-producing property is best determined by averaging the sale prices of any three other income-producing properties that have recently sold. 
(3)In the determination of an income producing property’s market value, the terms “gross realized income” and “net operating income” are synonymous. 
(4)The capitalization rate applied to the net operating income of an investment property is related to the yield on comparable investment properties.","Answer: 4 Explanation: Option (4) is correct because it is true. Option (1) is incorrect because given that the net operating income remains constant, the market value of the property will decline as the required yield rises. Option (2) is incorrect because the market value of an income-producing property is best determined by the yields that prospective purchasers reasonably expect to earn. Option (3) is incorrect because net operating income and gross realized income (also known as “gross realized revenue” or “gross effective income”) are different; net operating income is derived by subtracting operating expenses from gross realized income."
"Question 688: Robert asks Whitney to act as his agent at the auction of the effects of a deceased rock star. Robert was an enthusiastic fan of the deceased and tells Whitney that no matter what, he must become the owner of the deceased’s vintage Rolls Royce, which is painted in a most attractive paisley motif. Whitney is also told that under no circumstances is she to come away from the auction without buying this automobile for Robert. At the auction, the rock star’s paisley Rolls Royce is offered with a second pin-striped version of the vehicle. The two vehicles are offered as a package and accordingly, Whitney as the successful bidder purchases both vehicles for Robert. If asked to discuss Whitney’s scope of authority, you would correctly answer that during the course of the fact pattern, Whitney was provided with: 
(1)express authority. 
(2)implied authority. 
(3)both express and implied authority. 
(4)neither express nor implied authority.",Answer: 3 Explanation: Option (3) is correct because Robert expressly granted Whitney the authority to purchase the deceased’s “paisley motif” Rolls Royce by instructing Whitney not to come away from the auction without buying the automobile under any circumstances. These instructions also granted Whitney the implied authority to purchase the second “pin-striped” automobile since purchasing the second automobile was necessary in order to carry out the express instructions (to purchase the “paisley motif” automobile). Option (4) is incorrect for this reason. Options (1) and (2) are incorrect because they do not describe the full scope of Whitney’s authority.
"Question 689: Which of the following correctly outlines the objective/task method of creating a promotional budget? 
(1)Define the competition, outline competitors’ expenditures, and set tasks to maintain competitive-parity with competitors 
(2)Conduct tasks in order to reach a sales objective that is specific, realistic, measurable, and within a predetermined timeline 
(3)Create an objective, analyze costs and benefits, and determine the tasks to reach the objective 
(4)Define the advertising objective as “SMART”, outline the necessary tasks, and estimate the costs of performing the tasks","Answer: 4 Explanation: Option (4) is correct because the “objective/task” method of creating a promotional budget requires that the licensee first determine the objectives of the advertisement, and then determine the desired tasks and activities necessary to reach the objective. This involves defining a “SMART” marketing objective, outlining the tasks required to attain the objective, and estimating the cost of performing these tasks. Option (1) is incorrect because this approach describes the “follow-the-competition” method. Option (2) is incorrect because this approach describes the “SMART” criteria for developing effective business and marketing goals. Option (3) is incorrect because it fails to discuss the step of defining a “SMART” marketing objective."

(1)A site that allows the user to create written documents in MLS® format 
(2)A site that is used to register domain names for real estate offices 
(3)A software program that allows you to conduct an appraisal 
(4)A site that pulls together information on real estate related topics with a focus on real estate listings","Answer: 4 Explanation: Option (4) is correct because the MLS® serves many functions, including computing listing searches, producing automated hot sheets, and generating Comparative Market Analysis (CMA) presentations and other client prospecting tools. Options (1), (2), and (3) are incorrect because none of these statements correctly describes a primary function of the MLS®."
"Question 692: The effective annual rate of interest for 8% per annum, compounded semi-annually, is: 
(1)less than the effective annual rate for 7.2% per annum, compounded quarterly. 
(2)greater than the effective annual rate for 8.5% per annum, compounded annually.

"Question 694: The interest that is acquired by a buyer of a strata lot is: 
(1)a share in the strata corporation in proportion to the unit entitlement. 
(2)a joint tenancy with all of the other strata lot owners. 
(3)a fee simple interest in the strata lot and a joint tenancy with respect to the common property. 
(4)a fee simple interest in the strata lot and a fee simple interest, as a tenant in common, with respect to the common property.","Answer: 4 Explanation: Option (4) is correct because it correctly describes the interest which is acquired by a buyer of strata lot. Option (1) is incorrect because it describes what is acquired by a buyer of a unit in a cooperative, not a strata lot. Option (2) is incorrect because a buyer of a strata lot does not acquire their interest as a joint tenant with all of the other strata lot owners. If this was the case, then each owner within a given strata would share an undivided interest in the entire property (including each other’s units). Option (3) is incorrect because if the common property was shared via a joint tenancy agreement, then each owner would share a single undivided interest, and ownership could not be allocated in proportion to the unit entitlement."

"Question 698: Which of the following is NOT a private lender? 
(1)Mortgage corporations 
(2)Vendors who carry a part of the purchase price by granting a mortgage loan on a property 
(3)Trust companies whose estate and trust funds are invested in mortgages 
(4)Credit unions","Answer: 4 Explanation: Option (4) is correct because credit unions are considered to be institutional lenders that finance their investment by accepting deposits from their members. Private lenders are different from institutional lenders because private lenders typically do not fund their investment by receiving deposits from individuals. Options (1), (2), and (3) are incorrect because they are all examples of private lenders."

(2)will lapse after a reasonable time. 
(3)will lapse in 2 hours’ time. 
(4)will not lapse but rather, it must be revoked by the offeror.","Answer: 2 Explanation: Option (2) is correct because, where no time limit is specified, an offer will lapse after a reasonable time has passed. Courts will determine what constitutes a “reasonable” time for acceptance based on the nature of the offer or the nature of what is being sold. Options (1) and (3) are incorrect because there is no set expiration time for offers where no time period is stipulated. Option (4) is incorrect because offers can expire without being revoked by the offeror."

(2)An outdated design that can be corrected easily 
(3)Damage to the interior of a building that can be repaired economically

(2)A citizen of the United Kingdom who purchased land in Vancouver while staying in Canada on a working holiday visa. She received status as a permanent resident of Canada six months after purchasing the home. 
(3)An investment company that was incorporated in Canada, but operates under the control of a parent company in Brazil. 
(4)A Canadian citizen who holds title on the property for a friend who is a Japanese citizen and is looking to move to Canada after finishing a three year work contract in Tokyo.","Answer: 2 Explanation: Option (2) is correct because an individual who purchases property, pays the Foreign Buyers’ Tax, and within a year becomes a permanent resident or citizen of Canada, is eligible to claim back the Foreign Buyers’ Tax that he or she paid. Option (1) is incorrect because the tax applies to foreign nationals who are not Canadian citizens or permanent residents of Canada. Option (3) is incorrect because the foreign buyer’s tax applies to foreign corporations. Although the company was incorporated in Canada, it is controlled by a foreign corporation, are therefore would be considered a foreign corporation for the purpose of the tax.

"Question 703: Which of the following statements about fixtures and chattels is FALSE? 
(1)Where an item has been affixed for the enhancement of the use of the premises, that is evidence the item is a chattel. 
(2)Where an item is affixed slightly to the premises it will be considered, based on the first impression, to be a fixture. 
(3)A chattel is the personal property of the owner. 
(4)The test for fixtures and chattels examines the degree of affixation of an item and the purpose of affixation of the item.","Answer: 1 Explanation: Option (1) is correct because the “better use” test states that the affixation of an object for the purpose of improving the property will be taken as evidence that the object is a fixture, not a chattel (La Salle Recreations Ltd. v. Canadian Camdex Investments Ltd.). Option (2) is incorrect because part two of the test articulated in Stack v. T. Eaton Co. states that articles affixed to the land even slightly are presumed to be part of the land, unless the circumstances show that they were intended to remain as chattels. Option (3) is incorrect because the courts have developed the Stack v. Eaton test, a two part test for determining whether an item is a fixture or a chattel. Option (4) is incorrect because the Stack v.

"Question 705: In which one of the following mortgage repayment schemes do the monthly mortgage payments increase on a regular basis? 
(1)Reverse annuity mortgage 
(2)Graduated payment mortgage 
(3)Straight line principal reduction mortgage 
(4)Interest accruing mortgage","Answer: 2 Explanation: Option (2) is correct because a graduated payment mortgage has payments that increase on a regular basis over a specified term. Option (1) is incorrect because in a reverse annuity mortgage, there is no repayment until the end of the loan term or the death of the borrower; instead, over the term of the mortgage, the lender advances funds to the borrower. Option (3) is incorrect because in a straight line principal reduction mortgage, the same amount of principal is always paid and the corresponding interest is based on the outstanding balance; therefore, the monthly mortgage payments decrease. Option (4) is incorrect because in an interest accruing mortgage, no payments of interest or principal are made during the life of the loan."
"Question 706: Which of the following statements about federal legislation governing mortgage interest rates is TRUE? 
(1)The Interest Act requires that the rate of interest chargeable under a mortgage be “reasonable”, in the prevailing market for funds. 
(2)The Criminal Code defines a criminal rate of interest as an effective annual rate in excess of 50%. 
(3)Section 10 of the Interest Act creates the right to tender prepayment of a mortgage after 5 years, provided that the borrower is not a corporation and the mortgage is not for a business purpose. 
(4)The Interest Act provides that if a mortgage agreement does not specify the rate of interest chargeable, the rate allowed by law is 5%.","Answer: 4 Explanation: Option (4) is correct because section 3 of the Interest Act states that if a document requires interest to be paid but the rate is not set out then the rate allowed by law is 5% per annum. Option (1) is incorrect because the Interest Act does not require that the rate of interest chargeable under a mortgage be “reasonable”, in the prevailing market for funds. The Interest Act imposes no general cap on mortgage interest rates and states that, except as otherwise provided for by an Act of Parliament, any person may charge “any rate of interest…that is agreed on”. Option (2) is incorrect because the Criminal Code defines a criminal rate of interest as an effective annual rate of over 60%, not 50%. Option (3) is incorrect because section 10 of the Interest Act does not impose a requirement that the mortgage not be for a business purpose in order for an individual to qualify for the right to prepay his or her mortgage. Section 10 applies where: (a) the borrower is an individual; and (b) the mortgage provides that it is not payable for more than five years from the date of the mortgage."

"Question 708: In order for a licensee to be liable for damages caused by a negligent misstatement, certain facts must be proved. Which of the following does NOT need to be proved? 
(1)That the licensee making the statement did so in the course of business. 
(2)That the licensee making the statement had a contractual relationship with the person to whom they gave the advice. 
(3)That the licensee making the statement did not qualify or disclaim the statement. 
(4)That the licensee making the statement knows, or should have known, that the advice was relied upon.","Answer: 2 Explanation: Option (2) is correct because a licensee may be held liable for damages caused by a negligent misstatement made to a person with whom they do not have a contractual relationship. For example, a licensee acting for a seller could be held liable for negligent misrepresentation for a statement made to a buyer despite having no contractual relationship with the buyer. Options (1) and (4) are incorrect because the special relationship giving rise to a duty to take care (not to make negligent misstatements) will be created where a skilled person, such as a real estate licensee, gives advice in the course of his or her business to a person who is reasonable going to rely on that advice. Option (3) is incorrect because a skilled person, such as a real estate licensee, can avoid liability for negligent misstatements by giving their advice or opinion with a clear qualification that he or she accepts no responsibility for the accuracy or reliability of the advice."
"Question 709: In order to facilitate the exchange of possible resources in a negotiation, it is important: 
(1)to make repeated concessions in order to get the other negotiator to follow. 
(2)to deliberate issue by issue. 
(3)to make concessions when necessary. 
(4)not to disclose your true interests to the other side.","Answer: 3 Explanation: Option (3) is correct because the mutual exchange of concessions is crucial to effective negotiations. If you enter negotiations unprepared to make concessions it is unlikely that the other party will be willing to do so. Option (1) is incorrect because it is important that concessions occur in a relatively reciprocal fashion. If one party makes repeated concessions without expecting the other party to follow with similar behaviour, this encourages the latter party to hold tight and not participate in the exchange of resources. Option (2) is incorrect because considerable research demonstrates that more optimal solutions are reached when parties do not go issue by issue, and instead package and trade multiple issues simultaneously. Option (4) is incorrect because disclosing your underlying interests will often result in more effective negotiations. If you share your true interests, the other party will often reciprocate. This allows both parties to identify the true needs and desires of each other and then to find creative solutions that will satisfy those needs and desires."
"Question 710: RE/LAX Realty Inc. has ended the current year with a net income of $234,000. During the year, RE/LAX issued $14,000 in dividends, incurred $112,000 of operating expenses, and paid $15,000 in taxes. Which of the following MOST likely occurred on RE/LAX’s balance sheet? 
(1)Owners’ equity increased by $234,000. 
(2)Revenue decreased by $14,000. 
(3)Net income increased by $234,000. 
(4)Retained earnings increased by $220,000.","Answer: 4 Explanation: Option (4) is correct because changes to retained earnings are calculated by taking the amount of net income less any dividends paid to shareholders. RE/LAX earned a net income of $234,000 and paid $14,000 in dividends; therefore, the retained earnings account on their balance sheet should increase by $220,000. Option (1) is therefore incorrect. Options (2) and (3) are also incorrect because net income and revenue comes from the income statement rather than the balance sheet."
"Question 711: Johnny Collins is trying to design his new home to be as energy efficient in heating as possible in a cold climate with harsh winters. On which side of the house should he place the largest windows? 
(1)North 
(2)South 
(3)East 
(4)West","Answer: 2 Explanation: Option (2) is correct because south facing windows are the most energy efficient in heating. Options (1), (3), and (4) are therefore incorrect."
"Question 712: In terms of appraisal, “recent” means: 
(1)up to three months ago. 
(2)that time period during which demand and supply conditions have remained relatively stable. 
(3)the time period that has expired since a number of properties comparable to the subject property were sold. 
(4)the time period that has expired since a number of properties similar to the subject property were listed for sale.","Answer: 2 Explanation: Option (2) is correct because in terms of appraisal, “recent” refers to the time period for which supply and demand conditions have not changed or have remained relatively stable. Options (1), (3), and (4) are therefore incorrect."
"Question 713: Which of the following options BEST describes a caveat? 
(1)A warning issued by the Prosecutor’s Office 
(2)Formal notice that a court action has been commenced 
(3)Formal notice that a builders lien has been filed against the property 
(4)A notice placed on the certificate of title at the request of a person who claims an interest in the land","Answer: 4 Explanation: Option (4) is correct because a caveat is a note placed on a certificate of title by a person claiming an interest in land that temporarily prevents all dealings (e.g., transfers, mortgages, etc.) with the land inconsistent with the estate or interest claimed by the caveator. Option (1) is incorrect because caveats are not issued by the Prosecutor’s Office. Option (2) is incorrect because a caveat is a temporary “freezing” measure. If a party commences a court action concerning the property, then a certificate of pending litigation can be registered against the property to provide formal notice of that court action. Option (3) is incorrect because builder’s liens are registered as charges on title, not as caveats."
"Question 714: Which one of the following is TRUE with respect to the estimate of vacancy rates in the appraisal of income-producing properties? 
(1)Vacancy rates are expressed as a percentage of net operating income. 
(2)Vacancy rates are considered an operating expense. 
(3)Vacancy rates can be ignored if the subject property has never had any vacancies. 
(4)Vacancy rates are needed because the 100% occupancy assumption of gross potential revenue is unrealistic for most properties.","Answer: 4 Explanation: Option (4) is correct because it is unlikely that 100% occupancy will be reached in most properties. Option (1) is incorrect because vacancy rates are expressed as a percentage of gross potential revenue. Option (2) is incorrect because vacancy rates are not considered an operating expense; they are an allowance for reductions in gross potential revenue attributable to vacancies, tenant turnover, and nonpayment of rent or other income. Option (3) is incorrect because vacancy allowance is determined by the long-term vacancy rates in the area; therefore, it does not matter if the subject property has never had any vacancies before."
"Question 715: Yuppie is the sole proprietor of The Mountain Bike Emporium. On her balance sheet as at December 31, 20XX, total assets were $185,900. If the only liabilities were accounts payable of $2,900 and long-term debt of $89,450, what is the amount of Owner’s Equity: Ms. Yuppie, Capital account? 
(1)$93,550 
(2)$92,350 
(3)$185,900 
(4)$175,200","Answer: 1 Explanation: Option (1) is correct because since total assets = total liabilities on a balance sheet, if the total assets for The Mountain Bike Emporium = $185,900 and the only liabilities were accounts payable of $2,900 and long-term debt of $89,450, the amount of owner’s equity = $93,550 ($185,900 – $2,900 – $89,450). Options (2), (3), and (4) are therefore incorrect."
"Question 716: Which of the following statements regarding generally accepted accounting principles is FALSE? 
(1)Revenues are recognized at the time they are earned. 
(2)Fiscal year ends cannot be changed at will. 
(3)Assets are recorded at fair market value when they are acquired. 
(4)Expenses are recognized at the time they are incurred.","Answer: 3 Explanation: Option (3) is correct because according to the cost principle, an asset must be recorded for the amount that was paid for it. Options (1), (2), and (4) are incorrect because they are true statements."
"Question 717: Joe, a store keeper, asked Harry, a courier, to deliver some groceries for him, which Harry did. What is the result? 
(1)Joe does not have to pay Harry anything because Harry’s actions are past consideration. 
(2)Harry could bring an action under the Real Estate Services Act to force Joe to pay for the services. 
(3)Harry could recover a reasonable amount from Joe for his services under the principle of quantum meruit. 
(4)Harry could bring an action under section 54 of the Law and Equity Act to force Joe to pay for the services.","Answer: 3 Explanation: Option (3) is correct because quantum meruit is the doctrine that no one who benefits by the labour and material of another should be unjustly enriched thereby. In the circumstances of this question, the law will invoke quantum meruit to imply a promise (given by Joe to Harry) to pay a reasonable about for the delivery of the groceries, even though a specific contract price was not agreed to. Option (1) is incorrect for the same reason. Option (2) is incorrect because the delivery of groceries does not fall within the scope of the Real Estate Services Act. Option (4) is incorrect because section 54 if the Law and Equity Act deals with waiver of conditions precedent, not payment for services."
"Question 718: Which of the following scenarios is LEAST likely to offend section 52 or section 74.01 of the Competition Act (i.e., the criminal and civil offences of misleading advertising)? 
(1)A licensee knowingly misrepresents a strata unit as having two bedrooms, but it only has one bedroom. 
(2)A licensee advertised a house as having a recently renovated kitchen, which was false. The licensee did not know the statement was false, and did not investigate the matter. 
(3)A licensee posts the following advertisement on her social media page: “Come check out my listings in Kitsilano! Family homes starting at $700,000!” The licensee knew that the lowest priced home she had listed was $1,000,000. 
(4)A licensee advertises a Yaletown condo as 1,000 square feet. The condo is only 998 square feet.","Answer: 4 Explanation: Option (4) is correct because, in order to offend section 52 and section 74.01 of the Competition Act, a representation must be “false or misleading in a material respect”. Despite being strictly false, understating the square footage of a condo by merely 2 square feet would likely be insufficient to constitute a material misrepresentation. Option (1) is incorrect because misrepresenting a strata unit as having two bedrooms when it only has one would be considered false and misleading in a material respect. Option (2) is incorrect because section 52 prohibits reckless misrepresentations, and falsely advertising a house as having a recently renovated kitchen without first investigating the matter would be considered reckless. This false advertisement would also offend section 74.01, since section 74.01 imposes no requirement that the deceptive practices were made knowingly or recklessly. Option (3) is incorrect because advertising homes starting at $700,000 when the lowest priced home is, in fact, priced $300,000 higher, would be considered false and misleading in a material respect."
"Question 719: A visitor enters an apartment building to visit a tenant. As he enters the lobby, the skylight above collapses, injuring the visitor. If the visitor decides to sue the owner and/or building manager, what cause of action will the visitor likely use? 
(1)Negligent misrepresentation 
(2)Occupier’s liability 
(3)Breach of fiduciary duty 
(4)Nuisance","Answer: 2 Explanation: Option (2) is correct because the Occupiers Liability Act imposes a duty on occupiers of premises (in this case, the owner and/or building manager) to take such care as in all the circumstances is reasonable to see that persons coming onto the property (in this case, the visitor) will be reasonably safe. In this scenario, the visitor can argue that this duty was not met because the skylight collapsed, inuring him. Option (1) is incorrect because, based on the facts provided, no untrue statement was made by the owner or the building manager to the visitor. Option (3) is incorrect because, on these facts, there is nothing that establishes a fiduciary duty owed by the owner or the building manager to the visitor (a fiduciary duty is a special type of duty imposed only in select situations). Option (4) is incorrect because the collapse of the skylight did not interfere with the visitor’s use and enjoyment of the visitor’s own property."
"Question 720: Assume that a seller instructs his real estate licensee to make certain oral representations regarding a property that both the seller and the licensee know to be false. If the purchaser later sues the seller and the licensee on the basis of this misrepresentation, then: 
(1)the seller will be liable to the buyer because he explicitly authorized the tort. 
(2)the licensee can escape personal liability by arguing that he was authorized to commit the tort. 
(3)the seller and the licensee will not be liable if there is a clause in the contract of purchase and sale reading, “There are no representations, warranties, guarantees, promises, or collateral agreements other than those contained in this written agreement”. 
(4)the buyer’s only remedy will be a court order against the seller for damages.","Answer: 1 Explanation: Option (1) is correct because the seller will be liable because he, as the principal: (a) is responsible for the acts of his agent and (b) expressly authorized the tort. Option (2) is incorrect because an agent can never escape liability for torts committed by the agent on the basis that the agent was authorized by the principal to commit them. Option (3) is incorrect because the inclusion of this clause in the contract of purchase and sale gives the vendor protection against innocent misrepresentations; however, it will not protect the vendor in the case of fraudulent misrepresentation. Option (4) is incorrect because, as previously mentioned, the buyer can also bring an action for damages against the licensee. The buyer can also sue for rescission of the contract."
"Question 721: Which of the following statements concerning a corporation’s capacity to contract is TRUE? 
(1)Under the Business Corporations Act, a contract entered into by a company before that company exists CANNOT be ratified after the company is formed. 
(2)There can never be a limitation on the legal capacity of a corporation to enter a contract because a corporation can contract just as an individual person can. 
(3)Any person may ascertain the legal capacity of a corporation to contract by reviewing its incorporation documents maintained at its official records office. 
(4)None of the above","Answer: 3 Explanation: Option (3) is correct because all companies must have an official records office. At that office, any person can look over the incorporation documents of the company. Option (1) is incorrect because the common law has been altered by statute to make it possible for companies incorporated under the Business Corporations Act to ratify a pre-incorporation contract by act or conduct. Option (2) is incorrect because different ratification rules apply to companies operating in British Columbia that are incorporated under federal or another province’s legislation. These rules may, therefore, restrict the legal capacity of a corporation to enter a contract."
"Question 722: What is the purpose of restating many of the common law fiduciary duties owed by a licensee to a client in the Real Estate Services Rules? 
(1)In the case of a breach of fiduciary duty, the client will be able to receive twice the amount of damages. 
(2)It allows a client to also bring action against the licensee for a breach of the Rules. 
(3)A breach of a fiduciary duty may also result in disciplinary proceedings by the British Columbia Financial Services Authority. 
(4)It tends to be easier to prove a violation of the Rules, allowing judges to rule in favour of the client more often with the Rules than with the common law fiduciary duties.","Answer: 3 Explanation: Option (3) is correct because the Real Estate Services Rules (the “Rules”) restate these duties so that the British Columbia Financial Services Authority can initiate disciplinary proceedings against the licensee independently of any common law action that a client may bring against the licensee. Option (1) is incorrect because the client will not be able to receive additional damages under the Rules. Option (2) is incorrect because a client can only bring action against a licensee for breaching his or her common law duties, not for a breach of the Rules. Option (4) is incorrect because when the Rules simply restate a common law fiduciary duty, it will not be easier (or more difficult) to prove a breach of either."
"Question 723: A mortgage broker will advance $97,000 to a borrower who has agreed to pay a brokerage fee of $2,200. As a consequence, the face value of the loan will be $99,200. The loan will be amortized over 25 years with monthly payments at j2 = 6%. Calculate the monthly payment required to amortize the loan. 
(1)$620.62 
(2)$634.69 
(3)$690.83 
(4)$650.74","Answer: 2 Explanation: Press Display 6  NOM% 6 2  P/YR 2  EFF% 6.09 12  P/YR 12  NOM% 5.926346 99200 PV 99,200 300 N 300 0 FV 0 PMT 634.68817 The monthly payment required to amortize the loan is $634.69."
"Question 724: Akiko Yamada vacated the property she had just sold, taking all her household furniture. Assuming she has taken each of the following items, which item(s) must Akiko replace? (Assume that none of the following items have been dealt with specifically in the contract of purchase and sale.) 
(1)A small Persian throw rug from the front hall, which had been chosen especially to complement the colours in the marble on the floor 
(2)An antique, stained glass window, which was hung on two large hooks in front of the living room window 
(3)Wall-to-wall carpeting from the den, which had been attached to a tack strip that, in turn, was attached to the hardwood floor 
(4)Akiko must replace all of the above three items.","Answer: 3 Explanation: Option (3) is correct because the wall-to-wall carpeting that Akiko removed is most likely a fixture, and therefore was included in the purchase price (i.e., should have remained with the property when it was sold). Per Stack v. T. Eaton Co., articles affixed to the land even slightly – as the wall-to-wall carpeting is – are presumed to be part of the land. The purpose of affixing the carpeting was most likely to improve the den; therefore, the presumption that the carpeting is a fixture is unlikely to be overturned. Option (1) is incorrect because a throw rug is not attached to the land (except by its own weight), and therefore is presumed to be a chattel. Unless stipulated in the contract of purchase and sale, chattels are excluded from the purchase price of real property. Option (2) is incorrect because the stained glass window is most likely a chattel. The stained glass window, being attached (via hooks), will initially be presumed a fixture (per Stack v. T. Eaton Co.). However, this presumption is easily overturned. The window is affixed only slightly, being hung on two hooks, and therefore is quite easily removed. Additionally, since the antique window is merely hung in front of the living room window, it serves no apparent structural function. Therefore, the purpose of affixing the stained glass window is most likely to better enjoy the window as a decorative piece (similar to a painting), rather than to improve the land."
"Question 725: An acquaintance of yours has approached you and wants to know why the bank that may finance his purchase of a house requires an appraisal. He claims that since an appraisal is not required for an investment in stocks, an appraisal should not be required for an investment in real property. Which of the following statements provides the BEST reasoning for your support of the bank’s requirement? 
(1)The high turnover of real estate relative to stocks means that only an expert can keep up with changing values. 
(2)The local nature of the real estate market implies that the flow of information will be unlimited and easy to assemble. 
(3)It is difficult to find real properties that are very much alike. 
(4)Real estate purchase decisions are generally less significant than decisions regarding an individual share purchase.","Answer: 3 Explanation: Option (3) is the correct answer. Appraisals are required to determine the value of real property because it is difficult to find properties that are very much alike. Unlike real property, other financial assets such as stocks are more homogenous and will have an explicitly determined price. Options (1), (2), and (4) are incorrect."
"Question 726: Which of the following is the MOST common type of construction today for high-rise apartment buildings? 
(1)Wood stud frame 
(2)Steel studs and concrete topping 
(3)Concrete framing 
(4)Masonry walls and wood floors","Answer: 3 Explanation: Option (3) is correct because concrete framing is the most common type of construction today for high-rise apartment buildings. This is because most high-rise residential buildings normally require a two-hour fire-rating for floors and columns and concrete will achieve this rating without any additional protection for most applications. Options (1), (2), and (4) are incorrect."
"Question 727: Under the Strata Property Act, strata corporations are obligated to do certain things. Which of the following is NOT a duty the strata corporation is obliged to carry out? 
(1)The maintenance of property insurance on the common property 
(2)The creation of an operating fund for common expenses 
(3)The performance of work ordered by a competent public authority in respect of a strata lot 
(4)The establishment of a contingency reserve fund",Answer: 3 Explanation: Option (3) is correct because it is the owner’s responsibility to comply with work orders from public authorities in respect of a strata lot. This is why section 85 of the Strata Corporation Act requires owners to reimburse the strata corporation for the cost of work done by the strata corporation following the owner’s failure to comply with a work order from a public or local authority under section 85 of the Act. Option (1) is incorrect because the Strata Property Act requires the strata corporation to obtain and maintain full-replacement-value property insurance against harm to the common property. Option (2) is incorrect because the Strata Property Act requires every strata corporation to have an operating fund for common expenses that usually occur one or more times each year. Option (4) is incorrect because the Strata Property Act requires every strata corporation to establish a contingency reserve fund for expenses that usually occur less often than once a year or that do not usually occur.
"Question 728: Deborah is a trading services licensee. After providing her best estimate with respect to the value of Susan’s property, Deborah lists the property at $600,000. Jennifer, who has learned that Susan’s property is situated in the middle of an area to be redeveloped, immediately comes to Deborah with a full-price, subject-free, offer. In response to Deborah’s surprise reaction to the offer, Jennifer acknowledges that a redevelopment of the area is intended. Deborah does not advise Susan of the redevelopment as it might jeopardize the deal and, in any event, she feels that a redevelopment might cause the value of Susan’s property to decrease rather than rise. Susan accepts Jennifer’s offer and is delighted that the property sold so quickly. Which of the following statements is TRUE? 
(1)Susan does not have any claim against Deborah because she received the full listing price for her property. 
(2)If Deborah had advised Susan of the redevelopment, she would have breached the duty that she owed to Jennifer. 
(3)The proposed redevelopment might have affected Susan’s decision to sell her property and therefore, should have been brought to Susan’s attention. 
(4)As long as Deborah honestly believed that the offer was fair, she has satisfied her duty to Susan.","Answer: 3 Explanation: Option (3) is correct because Deborah, as Susan’s agent, owed Susan a duty to make complete disclosure of everything relevant to the transaction within Deborah’s knowledge. Regardless of whether or not Deborah thought that the redevelopment would increase or decrease the value of the property, Deborah had a duty to advise Susan of the redevelopment because it might in some way have affected Susan’s decision. Option (4) is incorrect for the same reason. Option (1) is incorrect because, where an agent has breached any duties to the principal, which Deborah has done, the agent’s right to commission will probably be lost. Therefore, Susan likely does have a claim against Deborah for the commission paid to Susan. In addition, Susan may have a potential claim against Deborah if she can prove that the property could have been sold for more had Deborah advised her of the redevelopment. Option (2) is incorrect because, in this scenario, Deborah did not owe a duty to Jennifer (a third party) not to advise Susan of the redevelopment."
"Question 729: The Local Government Act creates three different levels of local law. Which of the following is NOT one of these levels of local law? 
(1)Local improvement district 
(2)Local enterprise zone 
(3)Regional district 
(4)Municipality","Answer: 2 Explanation: Option (2) is correct because local enterprise zones are not a level of local law created under the Local Government Act. Options (1), (3), and (4) are incorrect because these are all levels of local government."
"Question 730: Luke and Alan are co-owners of a property, as tenants in common. They signed an agreement that stated that if either party wanted to sell their interest, the other party would have a right of first refusal to purchase the other party’s interest. Alan discovers that Luke has entered into a contract to sell his interest, without offering Alan an opportunity to purchase the property, as previously agreed. What should Alan do at this time? 
(1)Alan should a file a Certificate of Pending Litigation on the property. 
(2)Alan should register a caveat on the property. 
(3)Alan should register a judgment on the property. 
(4)Alan should hire a bailiff to take possession of the property.","Answer: 2 Explanation: Option (2) is correct because Alan should register a caveat, which will prevent the transfer of the property, and stay on the register for two months. This will give Alan time to commence a court action, if he so chooses. Option (1) is incorrect because Luke is not yet able to file a Certificate of Pending Litigation, because a court action has not yet been commenced. Option (3) is incorrect because Alan has not yet obtained a judgment against Luke, and thus is not able to register a judgment. Option (4) is incorrect because Alan has not obtained an Order of Possession, and thus is not yet entitled to hire a bailiff."
"Question 731: Vanna has agreed to sell her cottage to Pat. Vanna and Pat used a standard contract of purchase and sale, in which they agreed to the following dates: Completion Date: August 31, 2018 | Adjustment Date: January 1, 2019. Based on this information, which of the following statements is TRUE? 
(1)There will be no adjustment for property taxes on the buyer’s statement of adjustments. 
(2)The property taxes will appear as a credit on the buyer’s statement of adjustments. 
(3)The property taxes will appear as a credit on the seller’s statement of adjustments. 
(4)The property taxes will appear as a debit on the seller’s statement of adjustments.","Answer: 1 Explanation: Option (1) is correct because the buyer in a real estate transaction assumes responsibility for the taxes from the adjustment date onwards. Since Pat is assuming responsibility for the taxes on January 1, the first day of the year, no adjustment is necessary. Remember that property taxes are paid for a calendar year, even though they are usually due on July 1. Options (2), (3), and (4) are incorrect, because no adjustment is necessary for property taxes in this scenario, and therefore property taxes will not appear as a debit or credit on either the buyer’s or seller’s statement of adjustments."
"Question 732: In the context of appraisal, which one of the following properties is MOST likely to possess latent value? 
(1)A 30-acre dairy farm in the Agricultural Land Reserve 
(2)A recently constructed duplex unit in a single-family residential area of the city 
(3)A bicycle store that is built on land zoned for commercial use 
(4)A farmhouse situated on land zoned for commercial use","Answer: 4 Explanation: Option (4) is the correct answer (and Options (1), (2), and (3) are incorrect) as the farmhouse situated on land zoned for commercial use is likely to be the only option that has redevelopment potential."
"Question 733: In the comparative approach of appraisal, one method of making final adjustments to price is to use a rating grid. In using a rating grid, it is MOST important that: 
(1)the subject property be the basis of comparison and all comparables be adjusted to it. 
(2)the final market value be determined by averaging the comparable sale prices (after adjustments). 
(3)the comparable properties have the same square footage of improvements as the subject property. 
(4)the comparable properties have the same lot size as the subject property.","Answer: 1 Explanation: Option (1) is correct because when using a rating grid, the subject property is the standard of comparison and each comparable sale is adjusted to it. The subject property is not adjusted to the comparables nor are the comparables adjusted to each other. Option (2) is incorrect because the correct approach is to determine which comparable is most like the subject property and use that as main evidence for the final market value, not to average the value of the comparable sale prices. Option (3) is incorrect because the comparable properties do not require the same square footage of improvements as the subject property. Option (4) is incorrect because the comparable properties need not have the same lot size as the subject property."
"Question 734: You have a partially completed appraisal report that you need to fill in. The 2,500 square foot subject property has an alarm system. The house next door is similar in all respects except for the square footage and alarm system. The 2,700 square foot comparable sold for $236,500 and does not have an alarm system. If the market value of an alarm system is $4,500 and, above a 2,000 sq. ft. benchmark, each 100 sq. ft. is worth $6,000, this comparable will have to be adjusted for an alarm system and square footage by: 
(1)$0 and –$6,000 respectively. 
(2)–$4,500 and +$6,000 respectively. 
(3)$0 and +$12,000 respectively. 
(4)+$4,500 and –$12,000 respectively.","Answer: 4 Explanation: Option (4) is correct and Options (1), (2), and (3) are incorrect because since the comparable does not have an alarm system and the subject property does, there is a +$4,500 adjustment for the alarm system. In addition, since the subject property has 200 square feet less than the comparable, an adjustment for –$12,000 is also required."
"Question 735: Which one of the following statements is FALSE? 
(1)The principle on which the comparative approach of appraisal rests is that the price paid for a commodity will be equal to the cost of acquiring a substitute in the same circumstances. 
(2)In the comparative approach of appraisal, “recent” refers to the period immediately preceding the appraisal date during which values have remained stable. 
(3)If a comparable that has vendor financing at below market rates is used in the comparative approach of appraisal, the value of the below-market financing will be added to the sale price of the comparable to determine the adjusted sale price. 
(4)If the adjusted sale prices of five comparables are $100,000, $90,000, $95,000, $100,000, and $100,000, the appraiser could estimate the market value of the subject property to be $100,000.","Answer: 3 Explanation: Option (3) is correct (false) because the value of the comparable must be adjusted downwards to account for the benefit provided by the below-market vendor financing. Options (1), (2), and (4) are incorrect because they are true."
"Question 736: You have a partially completed appraisal report that you need to fill in. The 2,200 square foot subject property has 4 bedrooms and 4 bathrooms. The house next door is similar in all respects except for square footage, the number of bedrooms, and the number of bathrooms. The 2,300 square foot comparable sold for $245,000 and has 3 bedrooms and 3 bathrooms. If the market value of a bedroom is $4,000, the market value of a bathroom is $5,700, and above a 1,900 sq. ft. benchmark, each 100 sq. ft. is worth $6,000, the adjusted sale price for this comparable is: 
(1)$248,700 
(2)$260,700 
(3)$229,300 
(4)$241,300","Answer: 1 Explanation: Option (1) is correct because to find the adjusted sale price of the comparable, take the sum of the listed sale price with its adjustments to the subject property. In this case, the subject property and the comparable are identical except that the subject property has 1 additional bedroom, 1 additional bathroom, and 100 square feet less. The adjusted sale price is: $245,000 + $4,000 +$5,700 – $6,000 = $248,700. Options (2), (3), and (4) are therefore incorrect."
"Question 737: Which of the following is a current asset on the financial statement of a business? 
(1)Owner’s initial investment 
(2)Rents payable 
(3)Marketable securities 
(4)Sales revenue","Answer: 3 Explanation: Option (3) is correct because marketable securities is the only account listed that is classified as a current asset. Option (1) represents an owner’s equity account, Option (2) represents a current liability account, and Option (4) represents a revenue account."
"Question 738: Which of the following is defined as a form of online mapping that incorporates several layers of information? 
(1)Multilayered Mapping System (MMS) 
(2)Stacked Data System (SDS) mapping 
(3)Geographic Information System (GIS) mapping 
(4)Regional Integrated System (RIS) mapping","Answer: 3 Explanation: Option (3) is correct because geographic information system (GIS) mapping is a form of computer-based mapping that incorporates several layers of information beyond what a traditional map can tell you. GIS maps can integrate details on lot size and dimensions, zoning bylaws applicable to the parcel, ownership details, environmental restrictions, etc. Options (1), (2), and (4) do not perform this function."
"Question 739: With which one of the following loans is the lender’s initial capital and periodic income at the greatest risk? 
(1)Interest only loans 
(2)Interest accruing loans 
(3)Straight line principal reduction loans 
(4)Constant payment loans","Answer: 2 Explanation: Option (2) is correct because an interest accruing loan represents the greatest risk to the lender, since the entire amount of principal and interest is at risk for the entire length of the term. Options (1), (3), and (4) represent loans with lesser risk to the lender."
"Question 740: Which of the following statements regarding depreciation expense is TRUE? 
(1)It is another name for capital cost allowance. 
(2)It is an accounting concept that attempts to allocate the cost of an asset over the life of the asset. 
(3)It is usually calculated on land by the straight-line method. 
(4)It is the amount the Income Tax Act permits a taxpayer to deduct from income in determining taxable income.","Answer: 2 Explanation: Option (2) is correct because depreciation expense is an accounting concept that attempts to allocate the cost of an asset over the life of the asset. Option (1) is incorrect because capital cost allowance and depreciation expense are separate frameworks that both attempt to allocate the cost of an asset over the asset’s life. The difference is that depreciation expense is used for financial statements, and capital cost allowance is used for tax deductions. Option (3) is incorrect because land is not a depreciable asset. Option (4) is incorrect because this option describes the CCA framework."

(3)Where common law and equity conflict, the judge must apply the common law rule. 
(4)The judge may not do any of the above.","Answer: 2 Explanation: Option (2) is correct because, in Canada, the courts of equity and the common law courts are combined, meaning that judges in all provinces (except Quebec) can apply both common law and equitable principles in deciding cases brought before them. Option (1) is incorrect for the same reason. Option (3) is incorrect because, where there is a conflict between common law and equitable principles, equitable principles take priority. Option (4) is incorrect because Option (2) is true."

Which of the following statements correctly describe Erica's obligations to Chris? 
(1)Erica must not end Chris's tenancy if he does not want the repairs to be conducted. 
(2)Erica has no obligation to offer Chris any terms for returning to the unit after the repairs are complete. 
(3)Erica must offer Chris the right of first refusal to enter into a new tenancy agreement after the repairs are complete, at the previous rate of rent. 
(4)Erica must offer Chris the right of first refusal to enter into a new tenancy agreement after the repairs are complete, at a rent determined by Erica.","Answer: 4 Explanation: Option (4) is the correct answer. Option (1) is incorrect because under section 49 of the Residential Tenancy Act, a landlord may end a tenancy agreement if they intend to renovate or repair a rental unit in a manner that requires it to be vacant.

(4)A fee simple interest in the strata lot, and a proportionate fee simple interest in the common property as a tenant in common with the other owners","Answer: 4 Explanation: Option (4) is correct because the owner of a freehold strata lot holds a fee simple interest in the strata lot, and a proportionate fee simple interest in the common property as a tenant in common. Option (1) is incorrect because a fee simple interest is held in both the strata lot and the common property. Option (2) is incorrect because the fee simple interest in the common property is held as a tenant in common, not as a joint tenant. Option (3) is incorrect because a strata lot owner possesses a fee simple interest in the strata lot, rather than merely a license to occupy the strata lot."

(3)must give reasonable notice to the offeree before revoking the offer. 
(4)must give at least 72 hours’ notice to the offeree before revoking the offer.","Answer: 2 Explanation: Option (2) is correct because revocation must always be actually communicated to be effective. Option (1) is incorrect because an offeror can revoke their offer at any time prior to acceptance, regardless of whether or not the previously stated time limit has expired.

(2)lawful if the agreement is reduced to writing and signed by both parties. 
(3)specifically provided for as acceptable under the regulations to the Real Estate Services Act.

"Question 758: Assume that you have a $100,000 mortgage loan at a rate of 10% per annum, compounded semi-annually over a 5-year amortization with monthly payments. If the amortization period of a loan is increased to 10 years and the remaining loan terms are unchanged: 
(1)the interest portion of the periodic payments will be reduced. 
(2)the amount of outstanding principal at any point in time will be increased. 
(3)the interest rate on the mortgage will be reduced. 
(4)there is reduced risk to the lender.","Answer: 2 Explanation: Lengthening the amortization period means that more time is allowed for the borrower to pay off the loan. For constant payment mortgage loans, the initial first payments are composed of a greater portion of interest, whereas the last payments are composed of a greater portion of principal payments. Below is an example demonstrating changes in amortization. This example has a 5-year amortization period; calculate OSB24.

Therefore, Option (2) is correct. Your payments have decreased and you are stretching out the time needed to pay of off the loan. You are paying more interest, and since interest is paid more at the beginning than at the end of the loan, your payments on principal are delayed; therefore, at each point in time, the amount outstanding on your principal will be greater."

(2)Steve-Ann has breached the common law principles of agency law. 
(3)Both (1) and (2) are true.

Option (2) is incorrect because the strata corporation includes all of the individual strata owners, not just elected representatives. Option (3) is incorrect because strata owners own privately owned (divided) strata lots in fee simple, and own common property as tenants in common.

Option (1) is incorrect because a landlord may end a tenancy if the tenant or a person permitted on the residential property by the tenant has significantly interfered with or unreasonably disturbed another occupant or the landlord of the residential property. Option (3) is incorrect because a landlord may end a tenancy if rent is a tenant is repeatedly late paying rent.

(2)The trustee is the individual or entity for whom the property is beneficially held. 
(3)The trustee is the financial institution hired by the executor of an estate to handle the transfer of title from the deceased to their heirs. 
(4)The trustee is the government agency that is appointed to administer the assets of all persons in British Columbia who become incapable of managing their own affairs.","Answer: 1 Explanation: Option (1) is correct because a trustee is an individual or entity in whose name a property is held, in trust for the benefit of another person, known as the beneficiary. Option (2) is incorrect because the person who the property is held for the benefit of is known as the beneficiary. Option (3) is incorrect because while an executor may seek assistance in handling a transfer of title from an estate, the title will normally be put into the name of the executor, rather than a financial institution.

The strata council has ordered the removal of Jane’s dog and Karl’s cat from their lots. Which of the following statements is FALSE? 
(1)Karl must remove his cat; the bylaw is enforceable against him. 
(2)Jane will not be subject to the new bylaw because she had a dog before the bylaw was passed. 
(3)Pet restrictions are valid under the Strata Property Act. 
(4)The Schedule of Standard Bylaws allows an owner one dog or one cat, and therefore Karl and Jane can keep their pets.","Answer: 4 Explanation: Option (4) is correct because the Standard Bylaws can be amended by a strata corporation passing their own bylaw restricting pets, and is therefore false. Option (1) is incorrect because Karl purchased his lot after the bylaw was passed, and is therefore true. Option (2) is incorrect because bylaws prohibiting pets do not apply to pets living with an owner, tenant, or occupant at the time the bylaw is passed, and is therefore true. Option (3) is incorrect because the Strata Property Act allows for pet restriction bylaws to be passed, and is therefore true."

(3)A contravention that relates to the advertising of and signage on personal offices 
(4)Licensees maintain personal offices and signage indicates that real estate services are provided from the office",Answer: 1 Explanation: Option (1) is correct because the most common advertising contravention for which a penalty may be imposed is failing to display the name of a licensee’s brokerage on an advertisement in a “prominent and easily readable way” as is required under section 40(2) of the Rules.

(1)a design deficiency in today’s market. 
(2)functional depreciation under the cost approach of appraisal. 
(3)a patent defect. 
(4)physical curable depreciation.","Answer: 4 Explanation: Option (4) is correct because if a person standing on the porch is able to look straight down a hallway into the main bathroom when the front door is open, this is not considered to be physical curable depreciation but rather functional and likely incurable. Option (1) is incorrect because this is considered a design deficiency in today’s market.

"Question 769: Howard slipped on a patch of ice and broke his ankle when walking up Laura’s driveway to deliver a package. As a result, Howard suffered loss of wages until he recovered. Which of the following statements is TRUE? 
(1)Howard is a trespasser; therefore, Laura does not owe him a duty of care under the Occupiers Liability Act. 
(2)If Laura had taken reasonable and responsible precautions, such as applying sand or salt regularly to prevent ice building up on the driveway, she will likely not be liable to Howard under the Occupiers Liability Act. 
(3)If Laura is only a tenant under a month-to-month lease of the premises, she will not be liable to Howard. 
(4)Laura will be liable to Howard for all his damages even if she was not negligent.","Answer: 2 Explanation: Option (2) is correct because section 3(1) of the Occupiers Liability Act requires an occupier of premises to take that care that in all the circumstances is reasonable to see that a person will be reasonably safe in using the premises. By taking these steps, it is likely that Laura met the requisite standard of care and would not be liable. Option (1) is incorrect because an occupier owes a duty of care under the Occupiers Liability Act even to trespassers, unless they are trespassing while committing or having the intention to commit a criminal act. Option (3) is incorrect because an occupier is defined in the Occupiers Liability Act as a person who is in physical possession of premises, and does not depend on the length of the lease. Option (4) is incorrect because Laura will only be liable to Howard for his damages if she breached the standard of care owed to Howard, making her negligent."

(1)a charge. 
(2)an agreement for sale. 
(3)a right to purchase. 
(4)a restrictive covenant.","Answer: 1 Explanation: Option (1) is correct because in British Columbia, under the Torrens system of land title registration, all mortgages are registered as charges against the title.

(2)long-term fully amortized mortgages; interest only loans 
(3)interest only loans; graduated payment mortgages

(1)An agreement between the parties 
(2)The concept of frustration 
(3)Performance of the parties’ mutual obligations 
(4)A patent defect","Answer: 4 Explanation: Option (4) is correct because a patent defect will not discharge a contract as the principle of “caveat emptor” (let the buyer beware) applies, and so the purchaser must take the risk of these patent defects. Option (1) is incorrect because a contract can be discharged by an agreement between the parties to waive full compliance with the terms of the contract. Option (2) is incorrect because a contract can be discharged by frustration. Option (3) is incorrect because once the final act of performance occurs, the contract is discharged."
"Question 778: Larry owns a large gift shop. For the past eight years, Marie, a jeweller, has leased an area in the back room for use as a workshop. Larry and Marie have an oral agreement that Marie will only use the workshop area during weekday mornings when the gift shop is not busy, so as not to disturb customers with the noise of her work. Marie pays $350 each month to Larry for this right. Larry has sold the shop to Theo for use as a restaurant, but he is uncertain what to do about his long-term tenant. You correctly advise Larry that: 
(1)the Commercial Tenancy Act requires that “reasonable notice” of a least six months be given to Marie of Larry’s intention to terminate the tenancy. 
(2)in order for Marie to enforce this agreement against Theo, it must be in writing and registered in the Land Title Office. 
(3)the agreement between Larry and Marie is not enforceable against Theo because it is only a licence. 
(4)the agreement is not enforceable against Larry because it does not meet the requirements of the Real Estate Services Act.","Answer: 3 Explanation: Option (3) is correct because a licence is a contractual agreement and so does not “run with the land” and bind successors in title as an interest in land would. The distinction between a licence and a lease is based on intention based on whether the parties to the agreement intend to grant an interest in land, or simply create a licence to occupy. Option (1) is incorrect because Larry granted a licence, not a lease. Option (2) is incorrect because the agreement is a licence and therefore is not enforceable against successors. Option (4) is incorrect because the agreement is a licence."

The British Columbia Financial Services Authority (BCFSA) is instituting a formal disciplinary hearing to investigate the situation and both Kenneth and the representative have received the notice of hearing. Kenneth does not think that BCFSA can discipline him and is angry that he is being held responsible for his representative’s conduct. Which of the following statements is FALSE? 
(1)BCFSA has the authority to subject Kenneth to a disciplinary hearing for the action of his representative, under the powers granted to BCFSA by the Real Estate Services Act. 
(2)The representative cannot be disciplined jointly with Kenneth; only Kenneth will bear responsibility for a breach of the Real Estate Services Act by his employee. 
(3)One of the disciplinary options available to BCFSA in this case is to suspend Kenneth’s licence. 
(4)If BCFSA imposes a discipline order on Kenneth, the Real Estate Services Act requires that BCFSA publish this order on its website and provide copies to any person upon request.","Answer: 2 Explanation: Option (2) is correct because both a broker and a representative employed by the broker can be disciplined jointly. Option (1) is incorrect because the Real Estate Services Act grants power to the British Columbia Financial Services Authority (BCFSA) to subject brokers to disciplinary hearings for the actions of their representatives, and therefore is true. Option (3) is incorrect because section 43 of the Real Estate Services Act allows for the suspension of the broker’s licence, and is therefore true. Option (4) is incorrect because the Real Estate Services Act requires that BCFSA publish all orders on its website and provide copies to any person upon request, and is therefore true."

"Question 781: In which of the following scenarios would the profit, or capital gain, realized upon the sale of property be MOST likely to be completely exempt from taxation? 
(1)The seller purchased the property as a long-term investment. 
(2)The seller purchased the property in order to “flip” the real estate by selling it quickly for a profit. 
(3)The seller purchased the property to provide supplemental income by renting it out. 
(4)The seller purchased the property to live in as their principal residence.","Answer: 4 Explanation: Option (4) is correct because capital gains are exempt from taxation where the property sold was the seller’s principal residence. Options (1), (2), and (3) are incorrect because they do not fall within the principal residence exception, and either 50 or 100% of the profit realized on the sale of the property would be taxed depending on whether it is considered a true capital gain or instead, business income."

(3)the amount of the deposit will appear only on the seller’s statement of adjustment. 
(4)the amount of the deposit will appear as a credit on the buyer’s statement and a debit on the seller’s statement of adjustments.","Answer: 4 Explanation: Option (4) is correct because the deposit paid directly to the seller will reduce the cash proceeds to be received by the seller upon completion, which is reflected as a debit, and will reduce the balance due from the buyer to complete, which is reflected as a credit. Options (1) and (3) are incorrect because the amount of the deposit will appear both on the buyer’s and seller’s statements of adjustments.

Option (1) is incorrect because a limited company can be granted specific performance at the court’s discretion. Option (2) is incorrect because a court can award specific performance if a defendant is without means. Option (4) is incorrect because even if the contract has already been partially performed, the court still has the discretion to award specific performance."

(2)The shareholders of a corporation cannot be held responsible for more than their agreed share purchase. 
(3)The shares of a corporation must be held by more than one party. 
(4)A corporation is a taxable entity.","Answer: 3 Explanation: Option (3) is correct because a corporation is owned by one or more shareholders. Option (1) is incorrect because a corporation is a separate legal entity, and so can be sued just as a natural person can be. Option (2) is incorrect because shareholders are liable only for the value of the shares purchased or agreed to be purchased, and have no further responsibility for the debts of the company once the cost of their shares have been fully paid. Option (4) is incorrect because a corporation has its own income tax status, and pays tax at a flat rate."

(3)To separate malware and viruses within the computer’s central processing unit 
(4)To replace all hazardous viruses with user-friendly malware within the computer’s hard drive","Answer: 1 Explanation: Option (1) is correct because firewalls are hardware and software boundaries frequently used to prevent unauthorized users from accessing private computers or networks connected to the internet.

(3)Provision to insure the property to replacement value or such lesser amount as the mortgagee determines 
(4)Provision to waive the rescission rights under the Mortgage Brokers Act","Answer: 4 Explanation: Option (4) is correct because it is not a common covenant of the borrower to waive rescission rights. Option (1) is incorrect because this is a substantial clause commonly used which states that the mortgagor will duly pay all taxes, levies and assessments whatsoever affecting the land and all premiums for insurance effected pursuant to this mortgage. Option (2) is incorrect because this is a substantial clause commonly used which states that the mortgagor will keep the land and the buildings thereof in good condition and repair, and he will not abandon or commit waste upon the same.

(2)A similar house in the neighbourhood sold last month, after having been listed for two months.

She has now sold her home and left for Winnipeg.","Answer: 2 Explanation: Option (2) is the best evidence of market value due to the similarity and recency of the sale. Option (1) is incorrect because the list price of the property is a subjective value, and appraisers are interested in the objective value that arises from a sale.

Since each unit is priced at $132,000 and the mortgage loan is for $102,000, the down payment is $30,000.

(3)A person who loses in the British Columbia Court of Appeal has an absolute right to be heard in the Supreme Court of Canada. 
(4)An appeal from small claims court is heard by three, five, or seven judges.",Answer: 2 Explanation: Option (2) is correct. Option (1) is incorrect because an appeal from the small claims court is taken to the British Columbia Supreme Court. Option (3) is incorrect because the Supreme Court of Canada can decide not to hear an appeal from the BC Court of Appeal.

(1)Once a break in the chain of title has occurred, all subsequent transfers or other dealings with the land are of no effect, even though the transactions have been made in good faith and for value. 
(2)The purchase of property from someone who has no ownership right to it also denies the purchaser any ownership title. 
(3)Any registered owner who acquires a fee simple estate in good faith and for valuable consideration is protected by our land title system. 
(4)If a person is named by the previous owner as the new owner of any estate in land, then that is conclusive proof, as far as the world is concerned, that they are entitled to that estate.","Answer: 3 Explanation: Option (3) is correct because, in British Columbia, the indefeasibility principle means that any registered owner who acquires a fee simple estate in good faith (honestly) and for valuable consideration (a reasonable price, given the circumstances and market value) is protected by our land title system. In other words, if a person is named on a certificate of title as the owner of the fee simple estate in land, then that is conclusive proof, as far as the world is concerned, that he or she is entitled to that fee simple estate. Option (1) is incorrect because it describes the common law doctrine of the void deed which was overruled by the principle of indefeasibility. Option (2) is incorrect because it also describes the common law doctrine of the void deed, which is sometimes referred to as nemo dat quad non habet, or “one cannot give what one does not have”.

(4)On December 31, the tenancy will automatically renew for one month and then terminate unless the parties give notice to continue.","Answer: 2 Explanation: Option (2) is correct because if the landlord and tenant do not enter into a new agreement before the expiry date, and the tenant continues to occupy the premises, the landlord and the tenant are presumed to have renewed the original agreement as a month-to-month tenancy. Therefore, Options (1), (3), and (4) are incorrect."

(2)The structural member, usually wood, placed at the top of window openings 
(3)A roof style commonly known as a hip roof 
(4)The structural member that supports the roof deck","Answer: 4 Explanation: Option (4) is correct because a rafter is the structural member that supports the roof deck. Option (1) refers to a dormer, Option (2) refers to a header, and Option (3) refers to a specific roof style."
"Question 799: In the process model for buying behaviour, which of the following is the initial need or trigger that starts the buying process? 
(1)Motive 
(2)Buyer’s trigger 
(3)Emotional desire 
(4)Felt need","Answer: 4 Explanation: Option (4) is correct because the process model of buying behaviour helps explain how consumers go about the purchase of shopping goods (i.e., real estate services) and looks at the buying process from the consumer’s perspective. A felt need is the initial need or trigger that starts the buying process. In real estate, many events can trigger the felt need to buy or sell a property. Options (1), (2), and (3) are incorrect because they are not the correct term for this initial trigger in the process model for buying behaviour."

(1)Informational message 
(2)Persuasive message 
(3)Appeal message 
(4)Reminder-oriented message","Answer: 4 Explanation: Option (4) is correct because reminder-oriented messages focus on keeping the product, service, or licensee at the consumer’s “top-of-mind.” Option (1) is incorrect because informational messages are designed to provide information and create awareness. Option (2) is incorrect because persuasive messages are aimed at generating a response from the recipient, such as making a phone call or sending an e-mail.

"Question 801: Which one of the following statements correctly describes the manner in which taxes are adjusted? 
(1)If the seller has already paid the current year’s taxes, the seller must be debited with the taxes from the adjustment date to December 31st. 
(2)If the taxes are overdue and a penalty is owing, both the amount of the taxes and the penalty must be apportioned between the buyer and the seller. 
(3)If the taxes are not yet due, no adjustment is made until the tax statement invoice arrives. 
(4)None of the above","Answer: 4 Explanation: Option (4) is correct. Option (1) is incorrect because if the seller has already paid the current year’s taxes, the seller must be reimbursed for that portion of the year from and including the adjustment date. This will be a debit to the buyer and a credit to the seller. Option (2) is incorrect because the seller is responsible for the full amount of any penalty. It is not adjusted because only the seller was liable to pay and failed to do so in a timely manner. The buyer would be debited their portion of taxes from the adjustment date to December 31, and the seller would be credited the buyer’s portion of taxes and debited the whole year’s taxes due plus any late penalties. Option (3) is incorrect because if the taxes are not yet due, an estimate of the charge will have to be made."
"Question 802: You have a partially completed appraisal report that you need to fill in. The house next door to the subject property is similar in all respects except for the number of bedrooms and numbers of bathrooms. This comparable has 3 bedrooms and 4 bathrooms and was adjusted +$4,200 for bedrooms and –$2,600 for bathrooms. If the market value of a bedroom is $4,200 and the market value of a bathroom is $2,600, it can be concluded that the subject property has: 
(1)4 bedrooms and 3 bathrooms. 
(2)4 bedrooms and 2 bathrooms. 
(3)2 bedrooms and 3 bathrooms. 
(4)3 bedrooms and 2 bathrooms.","Answer: 1 Explanation: Option (1) is correct because the value of the subject property calls for the adjustment of +$4,200 and we know that the market value of one bedroom is $4,200. So if the subject property is adjusted up by $4,200, we know that the subject property must have one more bedroom than the comparable (4 bedrooms in subject). There is a –$2,600 adjustment for bathrooms; therefore, the subject property has one less bathroom than the comparable (3 bathrooms in subject). Therefore, Options (2), (3), and (4) are incorrect."
"Question 803: In using the comparative approach of appraisal, the appraiser estimates the value from the evidence afforded by the sale price of similar properties that have recently been sold. Which of the following BEST describes what is meant by “similar”? 
(1)Similar in replacement cost 
(2)Similar in price bracket 
(3)Similar with respect to the dominant architectural features 
(4)Similar with respect to those factors that are likely to have a material influence on the behaviour of buyers and sellers","Answer: 4 Explanation: Option (4) is correct because in the comparative approach of appraisal, it is most important that the subject building and the comparable buildings be similar with respect to factors judged important by buyers and sellers. Options (1), (2), and (3) are incorrect because similarity is only required for those factors that have a material influence on buyers and sellers, and the sale prices they negotiate."

(3)An owner of a fee simple estate has the right to sell, rent, or lease the estate. 
(4)A fee simple estate is an estate that is held for a limited period of time.","Answer: 3 Explanation: Option (3) is correct because an owner of a fee simple estate has the greatest bundle of rights over his or her land that can be held in Canada, which includes the right to sell, rent, or lease the estate. Option (1) is incorrect because the term “fee” means that the estate can be inherited. Option (2) is incorrect because if the owner of a fee simple estate dies without a will, the owner’s heirs will inherit the estate in fee simple with the priority of the heirs being determined by the laws of intestate succession. Option (4) is incorrect because a fee simple estate has rights to the land for so long as he or she has heirs."

(1)Where the rules of equity and common law conflict, the court will apply the common law rule. 
(2)Equitable remedies are available to parties in a court action as of right, regardless of their conduct. 
(3)The rules of equity developed as a remedy for the rigidity of the common law in England. 
(4)Specific performance, injunctions, and legal damages are three types of equitable remedies.","Answer: 3 Explanation: Option (3) is correct.

(3)includes an implied covenant that the tenant will be responsible for fair wear and tear. 
(4)is generally a landlord’s obligation unless the lease specifies otherwise.","Answer: 2 Explanation: Option (2) is correct because unlike in residential tenancies, there is no general obligation on either the landlord or tenant to repair commercial premises. Option (1) is incorrect because the contract does not have to be registered to be enforceable between the parties. Option (3) is incorrect because there is an implied covenant that the tenant will deliver up the premises as he or she found them, fair wear and tear excepted. Option (4) is incorrect because there is no obligation on the landlord to repair."

"Question 809: Which of the following statements about periodic tenancies is TRUE? 
(1)Where a periodic tenancy is created as a result of a tenant overholding a fixed term commercial lease, the resulting periodic tenancy will be on all the same terms as the fixed term lease except the rent will be increased by ten percent. 
(2)Where a periodic tenancy is created at the end of a fixed term commercial lease of five years, the new periodic tenancy will always be for a term of five years. 
(3)Where a periodic commercial tenancy is created, it cannot be terminated by either party for at least one year. 
(4)Where a fixed-term residential tenancy expires, it will automatically convert to a month-to-month periodic tenancy unless the parties have agreed in writing that it will not do so, at the time they entered into a fixed term tenancy agreement.","Answer: 4 Explanation: Option (4) is correct because fixed-term residential tenancies automatically convert to a month-to-month periodic tenancy unless the parties have agreed in writing otherwise. Option (1) is incorrect because the resulting periodic tenancy does not include a rent increase of ten percent. Option (2) is incorrect because if the rent was expressed yearly, the new implied tenancy would be from year-to-year. Option (3) is incorrect because a periodic commercial tenancy can be terminated by either party by giving “reasonable” notice to the other."
"Question 810: Which one of the following is NOT a primary motivation for investment in real estate? 
(1)Diversification of an investment portfolio 
(2)Acquisition of a portfolio, the income from which will benefit the investor in retirement years 
(3)A need for short-term funds to finance the acquisition of chattels 
(4)A desire for accommodation for residential or economic activities","Answer: 3 Explanation: Option (3) is the correct answer as it is the only option listed that is not a motivation to invest in real estate. Investing in real estate is typically long term, and requires a high outlay of capital, so it will not provide short-term funds to acquire chattels.

(1)Change the common law 
(2)Develop a system of precedent 
(3)Alter the constitutional allocation of legislative authority between the federal and provincial governments 
(4)Publicize an important judicial decision","Answer: 1 Explanation: Option (1) is correct because the role most often played by legislation is to change the common law. Option (2) is incorrect because the common law develops a system of precedent. Option (3) is incorrect because the power of the government to make laws is set out in our Constitution, which cannot be amended by an ordinary statute.

(1)the value of the traded property is listed as a credit to the buyer and a debit to the seller. 
(2)the value of the traded property will appear on the seller’s statement of adjustments only. 
(3)no entry to either statement of adjustments is needed to reflect the trade. 
(4)the value of the traded property is listed as a debit to the buyer and a credit to the seller.","Answer: 1 Explanation: Option (1) is correct because this transfer of personal property is a credit to the buyer as it reduces the amount that the buyer owes, and is a debit to the seller as it reduces the amount of cash proceeds of sale due to the seller. Options (2) and (3) are incorrect because this transfer will appear on the statement of adjustment of both the buyer and seller. Option (4) is incorrect because a debit to the buyer would increase the amount owed to the seller, and a credit to the seller increases the cash the seller will receive on closing."

(3)Assumption of first mortgage, deposit paid, and balance due to complete 
(4)Buyer’s share of taxes paid, purchase price, and conveyancing fees",Answer: 4 Explanation: Option (4) is correct because these are all amounts owed by the buyer.

(1)debit in the amount of $174.12 
(2)credit in the amount of $1,264.87 
(3)credit in the amount of $191.52 
(4)debit in the amount of $191.53","Answer: 4 Explanation: Option (4) is correct because Elisa is responsible for 48/365 days for property taxes as the buyer is responsible for the adjustment date. The total property taxes is estimated to be $1324 × 1.1 = $1456.40. Therefore, Elisa’s portion is $1456.40 × (48/365) = $191.53. This is a debit on the seller’s statement of adjustments as it will reduce the cash proceeds due to her. Option (1) is incorrect because this value does not reflect the expected 10% increase in the current year’s property taxes.

(3)$20,000 
(4)$25,000","Answer: 1 Explanation: To calculate the depreciation expense for Fanny’s building, calculate the value of the building minus the salvage value. This will give us the amount to be depreciated. The straight-line depreciation expense equals the amount to be depreciated divided by the number of years."
"Question 834: Freddy May Ltd. purchased a small commercial building for $225,000, of which $100,000 was the value of the land.

(2)Because interests in land “run with the owner”, the easement was extinguished as soon as Sven sold Whiteacre. 
(3)Scott may only enforce the easement against Alice if it is a statutory right of way. 
(4)Because privity of contract does not apply to contracts creating an interest in land, Scott may enforce the easement against Alice.","Answer: 4 Explanation: Option (4) is correct because interests in land are said to “run with the land”, so the doctrine of privity of contract does not apply to contracts creating an interest in land. Option (1) is incorrect because the easement is enforceable between Scott and Alice because the easement is an interest in land which is not subject to the doctrine of privity of contract. Option (2) is incorrect because since interests in land “run with the land”, and do not “run with the owner”. Option (3) is incorrect because all interests in land “run with the land”, not only rights of way."

"Question 845: Larry is a real estate licensee. During negotiations for the sale of a property with a well water system, the buyer asked how reliable a water source the well was. Larry, relying only on information from the seller, told the buyer that the well was reliable and supplied sufficient water for normal domestic uses. After completion of the sale, the buyer discovered that the water available was completely inadequate for domestic purposes because of a serious water shortage problem.

Option (2) is incorrect because the seller does have a duty to disclose this defect to the buyer because it is likely a latent defect. Option (3) is incorrect because the seller can still be liable for misrepresentation because there is a relationship between the seller and the buyer giving rise to a duty of care."
"Question 846: Which of the following statements is TRUE? 
(1)A real estate licensee may safely ignore the requirement of writing established by section 59 (3)(a) of the Law and Equity Act so long as the buyer and the seller agree on the terms of sale.

(3)The court has the power to enforce an oral contract respecting a disposition of land, if necessary to avoid an inequitable or unfair result where the party relying on the contract has substantially altered their position. 
(4)If the party denying a contract, which is not in writing, has done some act that indicates the contract was made, the contract is not enforceable under section 59 of the Law and Equity Act.","Answer: 3 Explanation: Option (3) is correct because if a party seeking to enforce the contract has reasonably relied on the existence of a contract and in doing so has altered his or her position, a court may enforce the contract if only its enforcement will prevent an unfair result. Option (1) is incorrect because the Law and Equity Act writing requirement applies even when a buyer and seller agree on the terms of the sale. Option (2) is incorrect because a contract not in writing is not void, but may be unenforceable. Option (4) is incorrect because if the party denying the contract has done some act that indicates the contract was made, they will be “estopped” from denying its existence."

(1)If Harvey mails his acceptance, Mary must receive it before 2:00 p.m. on May 4 for there to be a valid contract. 
(2)Mary cannot revoke her offer prior to 2:00 p.m. on May 4. 
(3)If Harvey makes any substantial changes to Mary’s offer prior to accepting it, Mary’s original offer is terminated. 
(4)If Harvey telephones Mary to ask whether she intends to live on the property herself, Mary’s original offer is terminated.","Answer: 3 Explanation: Option (3) is correct because making a substantial change to Mary’s offer would be considered a counter-offer. The counter-offer becomes the new offer, which terminates the original offer. Option (1) is incorrect because if acceptance by mail is appropriate, then the “postal acceptance rule” applies, making the acceptance effective as soon as it is put in the mailbox, rather when it is actually received. Option (2) is incorrect because the party who made the offer can revoke it at any time before it is accepted.

"Question 851: Joe and Sue Mortgagor wish to purchase a house. Joe’s annual gross income is $35,000 and Sue’s annual gross income is $30,000. The house they wish to purchase has a price of $210,000. Ripley Finance Company has told the Mortgagors that they can supply uninsured mortgage funds for the house at j2 = 7.5%, with an amortization of 25 years and monthly payments. They have determined that the house has a lending value of $208,000 and annual property taxes are $1,900. Ripley uses a policy of requiring a 30% gross debt service ratio and will lend to a maximum of 80% loan-to-value. In the calculation of gross income, Ripley includes 100% of the principal wage earner’s income and 75% of the secondary wage earner’s income. Calculate the maximum loan the Mortgagors can expect (rounded to the nearest dollar).

(2)$166,400 
(3)$208,000 
(4)$150,006","Answer: 2 Explanation: For this question, calculate the mortgage amount based on the two constraints of the loan-to-value and debt service ratio. The maximum loan allowable will be the amount that satisfies both constraints: therefore, it is the lower amount of the two. LTV = 80%"

(1)The provincial government and the federal government together have legislative authority over most privately owned land in Canada. 
(2)The provincial governments have delegated their authority over privately owned land to local governments, and at present they retain no authority for regulating uses of privately owned land within the provinces.

(4)In British Columbia, all local governments derive their authority to control privately owned land use from the Local Government Act.","Answer: 3 Explanation: Option (3) is correct because under the Constitution Act, 1867, the provincial governments were given jurisdiction over matters affecting private property and were also empowered to delegate some provincial powers to local governments. Option (1) is incorrect because the Constitution Act, 1867 gave the provincial government jurisdiction over matters affecting private property, not the federal government. Option (2) is incorrect because although the province has delegated most authority to regulate land use to local governments, the provincial government has maintained certain power such as through the Agricultural Land Commission Act. Option (4) is incorrect because the Heritage Conservation Act also gives local governments the authority to impose restrictions on a private landowner’s use of their land."
"Question 854: Two neighbours, Ms. Finch and Mr. Falcon, each sold their homes last week. Ms. Finch sold her house for $150,000, while Mr. Falcon’s house only sold for $132,000.

(3)Where the tenant is specifically prevented from doing so by a clause in the lease 
(4)Where the lease permits subletting of the premises","Answer: 3 Explanation: Option (3) is correct because unless there is an express prohibition in the lease, a tenant under a commercial lease may assign without the consent of the landlord. Option (1) is incorrect because a commercial tenant can assign a lease unless the lease expressly prohibits them from doing so. Option (2) is incorrect because the landlord is not required to give his/her consent for an assignment of a commercial lease. Option (4) is incorrect because a tenant can assign a commercial lease even if the lease permits subletting the premises."
"Question 856: Which of the following statements concerning the common law doctrine of the void deed is TRUE? 
(1)A current fee simple “owner” under a void deed has no remedy other than to seek compensation from the government. 
(2)A void deed would cause all subsequent transfers of the land to be of no effect, even if made in good faith and for value. 
(3)A deed given in exchange for illegal consideration is not a void deed. 
(4)A current fee simple “owner” under a void deed could not have certainty of title after holding the property for 25 years.","Answer: 2 Explanation: Option (2) is correct because at common law, once a “break” in the chain of title occurred, all subsequent transfers or other dealings with the land were of no effect because of the maxim nemo dat quod non habet.

Option (3) is incorrect because a deed given in exchange for an illegal act or thing is a void deed. Option (4) is incorrect because a current fee simple “owner” could have certainty of title after the 20 year limitation period for lawsuits to recover a land title transferred by a void deed had expired."
"Question 857: Two identical houses in Amble Greene, a neighbourhood in Surrey, British Columbia, are most likely to have different appraised values because: 
(1)one property has maintained the yard while the other has not. 
(2)one property has an attractive mountain view and the other does not. 
(3)one property is 25 years old and the other is 26 years old. 
(4)one property was appraised during a rainstorm, the other was appraised on a clear day.","Answer: 2 Explanation: The correct answer is Option (2) because a property with a particularly attractive view may be worth much more than a property without a view. Option (1) is incorrect; the quality of aesthetic factors that can be corrected economically, such as landscaping, do not have an impact on appraised values. Option (3) is also incorrect because a one-year difference in age in a relatively new home is unlikely to have a material impact on appraised values. Option (4) is incorrect because the weather is unlikely to have a material impact on appraised values."

Option (1) is incorrect because the forms of advertising covered by section 52 are extremely broad, and include representations in print, oral, and digital form. Option (3) is incorrect because the courts will consider both the literal meaning and general impression of the advertisement to determine whether the representation is false or misleading in a material respect.

(1)an equitable mortgage. 
(2)an agreement of purchase and sale. 
(3)an agreement for sale. 
(4)a disguised form of mortgage.","Answer: 3 Explanation: Option (3) is correct because in an agreement for sale, the vendor “lends” the purchaser some portion of the purchase price but remains the owner of the property.

(1)expressly. 
(2)contingently. 
(3)by implication. 
(4)by ratification.","Answer: 2 Explanation: Option (2) is correct because an agent’s authority to act on behalf of his principal may not arise contingently.

"Question 868: A borrower approaches Ripley Finance Company about a mortgage on an income-producing property. The property produces an annual net operating income of $112,500. The lending value of the property is $880,000. Ripley will only lend to a maximum of 80% loan-to-value ratio, and requires a minimum debt coverage ratio of 1.25. Ripley’s terms are: j12 = 12%, a term and amortization period of 15 years, and monthly payments. Given these constraints, calculate the maximum allowable loan (rounded to the nearest dollar). 
(1)$624,912 
(2)$660,000 
(3)$976,426 
(4)$634,728","Answer: 1 Explanation: For this question, calculate the mortgage amount based on the constraints of loan-to-value and debt coverage ratio. The maximum loan allowable will be the amount that satisfies both constraints; therefore, it is the lower amount of the two.

"Question 869: Which of the following is an example of a legal non-conforming use? 
(1)A basement suite in an area near a university that has been zoned for single family dwellings for over 20 years; the suite has been in existence for 15 years and the municipality is aware of it

(3)A restaurant located in an area that was originally zoned for commercial use, but 5 years ago was changed to residential use; the restaurant is thriving and the owners are currently expanding the building to accommodate an additional 20 seats 
(4)A long-established factory in an area that has just been rezoned from industrial to residential","Answer: 4 Explanation: Option (4) is correct because the factory was in compliance with the industrial use permitted by the zoning bylaw when it was built, and so it will be permitted to continue as a legal non-conforming use after the area is rezoned to residential use. Option (1) is incorrect because this is an example of an illegal secondary suite. The fact that the municipality is aware of the suite does not make the suite legal; rather, the city could elect to enforce its bylaws at any time. Option (2) is incorrect because the grocery was non-compliant with the bylaw even before it was amended, so the use was never legal. Option (3) is incorrect because an addition cannot be made to a building used for a non-conforming use unless it is required by law or permitted by a board of variance."

(3)must always be registered in the Land Title Office to secure a tenant’s rights against subsequent owners of the leased premises.

Option (1) is incorrect because a residential landlord cannot distrain a tenant’s goods for arrears of rent. Option (2) is incorrect because section 32 of the Residential Tenancy Act imposes an obligation on the landlord to repair all types of residential premises. Option (3) is incorrect because there is no obligation to register a lease of three years or less to secure a tenant’s rights against subsequent owners of the leased premises.
"Question 871: Which of the following statements regarding manufactured home registration is FALSE?

(4)Undertaking and carrying out real estate law reform","Answer: 4 Explanation: Option (4) is correct because the undertaking and carrying out of real estate law reform is a duty of the Real Estate Foundation, not the British Columbia Financial Services Authority (BCFSA). Option (1) is incorrect because according to the Real Estate Services Act, states that BFCSA is responsible for issuing real estate licenses. Option (2) is incorrect because BCFSA may conduct investigations and hold formal disciplinary processes.

(3)The statement must have been one on which a reasonable person would have relied. 
(4)The statement must have been made by the seller knowing it to be false, or recklessly as to its truth or falsehood.","Answer: 1 Explanation: Option (1) is correct because a misrepresentation is a false statement of fact, not of opinion. Option (2) is incorrect because in order to be a misrepresentation that would entitle the buyer to rescind the contract, the statement must have induced the other party to enter into the contract. Option (3) is incorrect because the statement must also be one which would have induced a reasonable person to enter into the contract. Option (4) is incorrect because in order to claim damages, the seller must have known it was false, or have been reckless as to its truth or falsehood."
"Question 876: Which of the following could a defendant use as a defence to a claim in negligence against them? 
(1)The defendant did not intend to cause injury or damage to the plaintiff. 
(2)The defendant breached the standard of care owed to the plaintiff. 
(3)The damage suffered by the plaintiff was not reasonably foreseeable by a person in the defendant’s position. 
(4)The act of the defendant was authorized by statute.","Answer: 3 Explanation: Option (3) is correct because damages that are not reasonably foreseeable are considered too “remote” in law, and a plaintiff will not be able to get compensation for them. Option (1) is incorrect because a claim for negligence is concerned with whether the defendant breached the standard of care owed, not whether they intended to cause injury or damage to the plaintiff. Option (2) is incorrect because this is a required element for a successful claim of negligence. Option (4) is incorrect because even if an act was authorized by statute, a defendant could still be found negligent for the way that act was done."

Option (1) is incorrect because under the doctrine of privity of contract, only the parties to a contract can sue or be sued for its breach. Option (3) is incorrect because one exception to the doctrine of privity of contract is contracts which create an interest in land. Option (4) is incorrect because the Law and Equity Act states that a statutory assignment must be in writing, must be absolute and unconditional, and notice must be given in writing to the original promissor."
"Question 878: George bought two units in a 10-unit condominium project. Within one week of the completion of this purchase, some of the owners of another condominium unit, the Smithe family, were killed in an accident in the jacuzzi whirlpool. Mrs. Smithe was the sole survivor of this family. The pool is located on the common property in which George now owns an interest.

(1)George must pay his proportionate share of any judgment registered against the common property of the strata corporation. 
(2)George will owe Mrs. Smithe absolutely nothing as the Strata Property Act contains provisions requiring all strata corporations to obtain and maintain liability insurance to insure against this type of occupiers liability. 
(3)The Strata Property Act requires the strata corporation to pay out Mrs. Smithe’s judgment from its contingency reserve fund. George will pay only his proportionate share of any amount left unpaid after the reserve fund is used up. 
(4)Because George has not owned the units for a minimum of two weeks before the accident occurred, he is not responsible to pay any proportionate amount of the judgment.","Answer: 1 Explanation: Option (1) is correct because a judgment against the strata corporation is a judgment against all the owners, and every strata lot owner is liable to pay the judgment in the portions set out in the Schedule of Unit Entitlement. Option (2) is incorrect because although the Strata Property Act requires the strata corporation to maintain insurance against liability for bodily injury, if this insurance does not cover the full judgment, George would still be liable to pay his proportionate liability. Option (3) is incorrect because the contingency reserve fund is used for paying for common expenses, not for paying damage awards. Option (4) is incorrect because since George is an owner, he must pay his proportionate liability."

(2)The damage caused is trifling. 
(3)David has authority under a municipal business licence to carry on the activity. 
(4)David is using his property reasonably.",Answer: 2 Explanation: Option (2) is correct because it is a valid defence to private nuisance if the damage caused is trifling and of little consequence. Option (1) is incorrect because it is no defence to say that the utmost care and skill have been taken. Option (3) is incorrect because having authority under a municipal business licence is not a defence to private nuisance. Option (4) is incorrect because it is no defence to say that a person is only making a reasonable use of his or her property.

(1)The easement must be negative in nature. 
(2)The easement must be capable of forming the subject matter of a grant. 
(3)The dominant and servient tenements must be owned by different parties. 
(4)The easement must accommodate the servient tenement.","Answer: 2 Explanation: Option (2) is correct. The easement must be capable of forming the subject matter of a grant, which means that the easement must be capable of reasonably exact definition. One must be able to identify its boundaries. Furthermore, the person granting the easement and the person whose land receives the benefit of the easement must have the necessary capacity to be grantor and grantee. For example, a tenant cannot grant an easement that binds the property after the tenancy expires. Option (1) is incorrect because an easement can be either positive or negative in nature (in comparison to a restrictive covenant, which must be negative in nature). Option (3) is incorrect because one party can own both the dominant and servient tenement provided that they are two different parcels of land. Option (4) is incorrect because the easement must accommodate the dominant tenement, not the servient tenement."

(3)All other charges, liens, encumbrances, and interests registered on the borrower’s title are foreclosed or “wiped” off the title. 
(4)The petitioner may sell the property after taking title to it and does not have to account to the borrower for any profit that might be realized in excess of the mortgage debt.","Answer: 3 Explanation: Option (3) is correct because an order absolute of foreclosure does not wipe all other charges, liens, encumbrances, and interests off the title. Option (1) is incorrect because once the petitioner has been granted the order absolute of foreclosure, he or she may not then sue the borrower on the borrower’s personal covenant. Option (2) is incorrect because the order absolute of foreclosure declares that the respondents are foreclosed of any right, title, or interest in the mortgaged property and it directs them to deliver up possession of the property to the petitioner. Option (4) is incorrect because if the petitioner sells the land, there is no requirement to account to the borrower for any money received or any profit which might be realized in excess of the mortgaged debt."
"Question 884: With a portable mortgage: 
(1)a purchaser takes over responsibility for the remaining contractual terms of an existing mortgage. 
(2)a borrower can save money when the existing mortgage has a lower interest rate than current market rates. 
(3)the vendor creates a vendor-supplied mortgage. 
(4)the portable funds fee (PFF) is always charged.","Answer: 2 Explanation: Option (2) is correct because a portable mortgage allows the borrower to sell his or her home and carry the mortgage over to the purchase of a new home. Because of this portability, the borrower will save money if his or her mortgage has a lower interest rate than the current interest rate that a new mortgage would be written at. Option (1) is incorrect because a portable mortgage allows a seller of their home to carry the mortgage over to a purchase of a new home. Option (3) is incorrect because a portable mortgage cannot also be vendor-supplied. Option (4) is incorrect because a portable funds fee is not necessarily always charged on a portable mortgage."

(3)Condominiums are generally easier to sell than cooperatives. 
(4)Where an existing building is being converted to either a condominium or a non-profit cooperative, the existing tenants are covered by the protections afforded by the British Columbia Residential Tenancy Act.","Answer: 1 Explanation: Option (1) is correct because buyers of cooperatives own shares in the cooperative association or company and is a tenant, rather than a fee simple owner. Option (2) is incorrect because the disclosure requirements in the Real Estate Development Marketing Act apply to cooperatives and condominiums. Option (3) is incorrect because condominiums are generally easier to sell than cooperatives because the cooperative association’s board of directors must approve the person who proposes to buy a cooperative owner’s shares. Option (4) is incorrect because where a building is being converted to a cooperative, any residential tenants who are required to move will be entitled to the protections of the Residential Tenancy Act."

(2)A brokerage’s real estate commission always appears on the buyer’s statement of adjustments as a credit. 
(3)A seller of real property is responsible for their property taxes up to the day before the adjustment date in a contract of purchase and sale.

Option (1) is incorrect because where an existing mortgage will be assumed by the buyer and remain on title, the amount of cash due to the seller is reduced which is reflected as a debit on a seller’s statement of adjustments. Option (3) is incorrect because the seller is responsible for property taxes up to the day before the adjustment date, and the buyer is responsible for the property taxes on the adjustment date. Option (4) is incorrect because a seller’s portion of taxes to be paid in the future will reduce the amount required to complete due from the buyer which is reflected as a credit on a buyer’s statement of adjustments."

(4)All of the above","Answer: 4 Explanation: Option (4) is correct because all of the statements are true. Option (1) is true because a special buyer is a potential purchaser that is interested in a particular property because it has a specific attribute, and he or she may be willing to pay significantly more or less than other buyers. Option (2) is true because real property is immobile, which causes the market for real property to be local by nature. Option (3) is true because the neighbourhood an appraiser considers in his or her analysis may not be confined to the subdivision. This will depend on the abundance of similar recent sales and the appraiser’s discretion."
"Question 893: The principle of “unlimited liability” implies which of the following?

(3)That an owner may lose more money than their initial investment 
(4)That there is no difference between being a sole proprietor of a small business and a shareholder of a large corporation","Answer: 3 Explanation: Option (3) is correct because unlimited liability means that the owner’s legal liability is not limited to his or her initial investment in the company.

"Question 895: Ryan wants to purchase a house that is listed for $376,000. The bank’s appraiser estimates that the lending value of the property is $375,000. Ryan’s gross annual income is $60,000 per year. The bank applies an 80% loan-to-value ratio and a gross debt service ratio of 32%. Property taxes amount to $1,800 per year. Assume that the lender demands a 25-year amortization period and monthly payments at a contract rate of j2 = 3%. The government specified qualifying rate is 5.25% per annum, compounded semi-annually. How much can Ryan borrow, given the stress test borrower qualification rules for uninsured mortgages? Round your answer to the nearest $10. 
(1)$266,630 
(2)$243,320 
(3)$230,000 
(4)$251,560","Answer: 2 Explanation: To calculate the maximum loan amount, calculate the loan amounts based on both the constraint of the loan-to-value ratio and the gross debt service ratio. The loan-to-value is calculated based on the bank’s appraisal of the property. In this case, the amount the bank appraises the property at is $375,000. Once the payments from the GDSR are calculated, the PV of the loan is calculated, taking into consideration the stress test qualification rules. The loan amount that satisfies both constraints (the smaller amount) will be the maximum loan amount. LTV = 80% Lending Value = $375,000 Maximum loan under lender’s LTV criteria = 0.8 × $375,000 = $300,000 GDSR = 32% P + I = (GDSR × Gross Income) – Property Taxes P + I = (0.32 × $60,000) – $1,800 P + I = $17,400 per year = $1,450 per month The mortgage qualifying rate is based on the greater of (1) the government-specified qualifying rate of j2 = 5.25% OR (2) an additional 2% above the mortgage’s negotiated contract rate. In this case, you would apply a rate of j2 = 5.25%, the government-specified rate, which is greater than the mortgage’s contract rate plus 2% of j2 = 5% (2% + 3%).

The maximum that Jake can borrow is the lesser of $300,000 (LTV) and $243,320 (GDSR). In this case, Jake can only borrow $243,320, rounded to the nearest $10."

(3)The insurance premium paid on an insured mortgage can be added to the loan amount. 
(4)Mortgage default insurance is insurance for the lender.","Answer: 2 Explanation: Option (2) is correct (false) because the insurance company guarantees that the lender can recover all of the funds loaned in case of default, but does not guarantee that borrowers will be able to make their mortgage payments without interruption.

(4)cannot be determined.","Answer: 2 Explanation: Option (2) is correct because when payments are rounded up to the next higher dollar for a fully amortized loan, the result will be a smaller final payment, and possibly a reduction in the number of payments. This is because the borrower is “overpaying” a slight amount each period. The cumulative effect will depend on the loan amount, amortization period, and the amount that the payment was rounded up. Options (1), (3), and (4) are incorrect for this reason."
"Question 927: Which of the following is NOT subject to the provisions of the Residential Tenancy Act ? 
(1)A residential condominium rented out by the offshore owner 
(2)An apartment attached to a warehouse rented under a separate lease 
(3)A basement suite in a private residence 
(4)A house let for a 29-year term","Answer: 4 Explanation: Option (4) is correct because leases dealing with residential property for a period of over 20 years are not “residential tenancies” and must be dealt with as commercial tenancies. Commercial tenancies are not subject to the provisions of the Residential Tenancy Act. Options (1), (2), and (3) are incorrect because they are all situations that are subject to the provision of the Residential Tenancy Act."

(1)Electric baseboard heating 
(2)Electric heated hot water radiant unit 
(3)Central gas fired forced hot air 
(4)Central gas fired forced hot water","Answer: 3 Explanation: Option (3) is correct because central gas fired forced hot air heating systems are advantageous because they have a rapid response to extreme outside temperature changes. Options (1), (2), and (4) are incorrect because these heating systems do not provide as fast of a response."
"Question 929: A borrower wishes to make monthly payments of no more than 30% of their monthly income of $2,500 for a period of 200 months. If interest rates are currently 9% per annum, compounded semi-annually, what is the maximum amount that should be lent? 
(1)$90,582.19 
(2)$89,371.22 
(3)$77,561.75 
(4)$78,374.01","Answer: 4 Explanation: The borrower’s maximum monthly payments are to be 30% of his $2,500 monthly income; in other words, the borrower’s maximum monthly payment will be $750 ($2,500 × 0.3).

"Question 930: Which of the following statements concerning listing agreements is TRUE? 
(1)A listing agreement is a contract between the seller and the brokerage, the terms of which can be relied on by the buyer. 
(2)For the brokerage to become entitled to commission, the offer to purchase presented by the brokerage must be substantially in accordance with the terms of the listing. 
(3)A listing brokerage will not be entitled to a commission if it does not have a listing agreement with the seller prior to listing the property for sale. 
(4)All owners listed on title must sign the listing contract.","Answer: 4 Explanation: Option (4) is correct because the listing contract must be signed by all of the owners. Option (1) is incorrect because a listing agreement is a contract between a seller and a brokerage and does not involve a buyer. Option (2) is incorrect because in order for a licensee to be entitled to commission, the licensee must produce a purchaser whose offer strictly complies with the terms of the listing agreement. Option (3) is incorrect because a listing brokerage can still be entitled to commission even if it does not have a listing agreement with the seller prior to listing the property for sale."

(1)Depreciation 
(2)Consideration 
(3)Voidability

(1)It is not an offence under the Competition Act for the visual advertisement to create a false impression as long as the written statements are true. 
(2)For a misrepresentation to be contrary to the Act, it must be false or misleading in a material respect. 
(3)The Competition Act applies to both oral and written representations. 
(4)To avoid liability under section 52, the person accused of the offence must show that they honestly believed that the representation was not false or misleading and exercised due diligence in making sure that was the case.","Answer: 1 Explanation: Option (1) is correct (false) because the general impression test is used in this situation, which can still result in a conviction under section 52. Option (2) is incorrect (true) because a misrepresentation will only be contrary to section 52 of the Competition Act if it is false or misleading in a material respect. Option (3) is incorrect (true) because section 52 applies to both oral and written misrepresentations. Option (4) is incorrect (true) because the accused may escape liability under section 52 if they honestly believed that the representations or advertisements were not false or misleading and that they exercised due diligence in making sure that was the case."
"Question 933: A prospective buyer signs an offer on a property for $250,000 and mentions to the listing licensee that she would be willing to pay as much as $270,000 for the property if necessary. The listing licensee presents the offer to the seller without mentioning that the buyer may be willing to increase the offer. The seller accepts the offer of $250,000. This fact pattern is: 
(1)an example of the agent’s ethical obligation to deal fairly with the buyer at all times. 
(2)a breach of the agent’s legal and ethical duty of full disclosure to her principal. 
(3)acceptable conduct on the part of the agent. 
(4)an example of the agent’s duty not to make a secret profit.","Answer: 2 Explanation: Option (2) is correct because the agent has a duty to tell his or her client everything relevant to the transaction within the agent’s knowledge. Failing to mention that the buyer may be willing to increase the offer is a breach of the agent’s legal and ethical duty of full disclosure. Option (1) is incorrect because the agent does not have an ethical obligation to deal fairly with the buyer at all times. Option (3) is incorrect because this was a breach of the agent’s duty of full disclosure, and therefore is not acceptable conduct. Option (4) is incorrect because this is not an example of the agent’s duty not to make a secret profit."
"Question 934: ABC Loan Co. (“ABC”) has agreed to lend $2 million dollars to Devco Ltd. in exchange for a registered first mortgage against Devco’s current residential construction project. The loan is to be paid out in four equal instalments over a five month period, but all payments are at the discretion of ABC under the “advances” clause in the mortgage. The first instalment has been paid and it is now time to pay out the second instalment. ABC has discovered that a builder’s lien has been filed against Devco’s property. You correctly advise ABC that: 
(1)it is obligated to pay out the second instalment to Devco; to refuse to do so would be a breach of the mortgage contract. 
(2)if the second instalment is advanced to Devco, the lien claimant will have priority over this and any other advances made under the mortgage after the date of registration of the lien. 
(3)the lien cannot take priority over ABC’s mortgage because the lien was registered after the mortgage. 
(4)None of the above statements is correct.","Answer: 2 Explanation: Option (2) is correct because the Builders Lien Act gives priority to the lien over a mortgage as of the date the lien is filed in the Land Title Office. Where part of the money has been advanced and then a builder’s lien is filed against the property, the builder’s lien has priority over further advances made under the mortgage. Option (1) is incorrect because the advances clause states that all payments are at the discretion of ABC, so it would not be a breach of the mortgage contract to refuse to pay the second installment. Option (3) is incorrect because the lien takes priority over all subsequent advancements of funds because of the operation of the Builders Lien Act. Option (4) is incorrect because allowing a builder’s lien to remain on title does not constitute a breach of the mortgage contract."

"Question 939: A clerk in the land title office mistakenly registered a fee simple transfer on the wrong title, with the result that Lot 5, owned by Michael, was transferred to Scott. Scott discovered this error and, instead of correcting the error, he sold the property to another person who was unaware of the clerical error and of Scott’s dishonest conduct. Michael discovered the error after the buyer had registered the transfer from Scott. He wants his land restored to him and the register corrected. You correctly advise Michael that: 
(1)because this situation was caused by a clerical error, the Registrar will correct the register and restore Michael’s property to him. 
(2)the person who bought the property, bona fide and for value, from Scott, is protected by the British Columbia land title system; as a result, Michael cannot have his property restored to him. 
(3)Michael contributed to his own loss by neglecting to register a lien on his title to indicate to anyone searching title that he was the registered owner; as a result, he cannot recover damages in a lawsuit against Scott. 
(4)because Scott acted fraudulently, the transfer of the property to the third party is a void deed, meaning that Michael can have the property restored to him.","Answer: 2 Explanation: Option (2) is correct because the indefeasibility principle means that any registered owner who acquires a fee simple estate in good faith and for valuable consideration is protected by the land title system. That purchaser can keep his or her title, even if the previous registered owner acquired title by way of fraud or forgery. Option (1) is incorrect because the indefeasibility principle allows the purchaser to keep his or her title. Option (3) is incorrect because Michael did not contribute to his own loss by neglecting to register a lien on his title to indicate that he was the registered owner. Option (4) is incorrect because the principle of indefeasibility overrules the common law doctrine of void deed, and so the transfer of the property to the third party was valid and the purchaser now has indefeasibility of title."

(1)A unanimous vote of 100% of the members of a strata corporation is usually required to approve an amendment to the bylaws of the corporation. 
(2)An estate in fee simple is created for each individual strata lot by the registration, and approval of the registrar of land titles, of a strata plan. 
(3)The condominium concept can be utilized only for residential projects. 
(4)Before a strata plan can be registered in the land title office, all of the strata lots must be presold.","Answer: 2 Explanation: Option (2) is correct because the registration and approval of a strata plan creates an estate in fee simple for each individual strata lot. Option (1) is incorrect because the approval required to amend the bylaws of the corporation varies based on the strata type, and whether it is before or after the second annual general meeting. Option (3) is incorrect because the condominium concept can be utilized for both residential and non-residential projects. Option (4) is incorrect because all strata lots do not need to be presold before a strata plan can be registered in the land title office."

(3)The relationship of the parties to a mortgage is that of debtor and creditor.

(4)A real estate representative is employed by their brokerage to trade in real estate in the brokerage’s name, on behalf of the brokerage’s clients.","Answer: 4 Explanation: Option (4) is correct because all real estate representatives are employed by a managing broker, and trade in real estate in the brokerage’s name and on behalf of the brokerage’s clients. Option (1) is incorrect because a licensee can only provide real estate services under the supervision of a managing broker.

(3)The brokerage and its agents have been designated to act as a team for the buyer. 
(4)The brokerage appoints one or more specific licensees to act as the seller’s sole agent.","Answer: 4 Explanation: Option (4) is the correct answer because under designated agency, while the contracting party is still the brokerage, the seller agrees that the brokerage will appoint one or more specific licensees to act as the seller’s sole agent.

"Question 945: Fletcher owns Lot 1, a rock-strewn beachfront property to which he had added 1 tonne of white sand imported from Aruba. Ana, owner of Lot 2, is Fletcher’s neighbour. Lot 2 has a tennis court located near the beach. On windy days, the fine white sand on Fletcher’s property is carried by the wind onto Ana’s property, where it coats the clay surface of the tennis court, making it very slippery and hazardous for anyone playing there. Ana has discussed this problem with Fletcher on several occasions but he has not done anything to prevent the problem from continuing. Ana has been unable to use her tennis court for several months as a result of the sand accumulating on the property. Which of the following statements is TRUE? 
(1)This is likely an example of the tort of trespass. 
(2)This is likely an example of the tort of private nuisance. 
(3)Ana has no basis in law on which to sue Fletcher because the problem is caused by natural forces. 
(4)Fletcher may successfully defend against a lawsuit brought by Ana on the basis that the damage caused is unintentional.","Answer: 2 Explanation: Option (2) is correct because the sand blowing onto Ana’s property, making the tennis court slippery and hazardous for anyone playing there, is likely to be considered an unreasonable and substantial interference with the reasonable use and enjoyment of her property, and would therefore be considered a private nuisance. Option (1) is incorrect because trespass requires an intentional act, and the sand was carried onto Ana’s property by the wind, rather than by an intentional act done by Fletcher. Option (3) is incorrect because Fletcher could still be liable for private nuisance even though the problem occurred because of the wind. Option (4) is incorrect because the tort of private nuisance does not require the conduct to be done intentionally."

(2)$340,355.45 
(3)$305,937.50 
(4)$313,467.23","Answer: 1 Explanation: Since we know that the comparable property has one less bedroom, its sale price calls for an adjustment. We know that the market value of one bedroom is $1,100, so the sale price of the subject property is adjusted up by $1,100. We also know that the comparable property has a garage, while the subject does not. Since the market value of a garage is stated to be $7,000, we must adjust the sale price of the comparable down by $7,000. Finally, it is stated that each 100 sq. ft. above the 2,000 sq. ft. benchmark has a market value of $3,000. Since the comparable is 200 sq. ft. smaller than the subject, we must adjust the sale price of the comparable up by 200 sq. ft. × $3,000 = $6,000. The adjusted sale price is $173,000 +$1,100  $7,000 + $6,000 = $173,100"

(2)The owner lives abroad, but he rents the property for six 30-day terms throughout the year in order to avoid paying the Empty Homes Tax. 
(3)The owner uses the property as a principal residence, but spends up to six months of the year abroad on business trips. 
(4)The owners initially purchased the property as an investment, but now that their daughter has started attending university in Vancouver, she uses the property as a principal residence from September to April of the same year.","Answer: 1 Explanation: Option (1) is correct because the owner would have to live in the property as a principal residence for 6 months in order to avoid the Empty Homes Tax; 3 months is not sufficient. In addition, investors who use their property as a short term rental without a hotel or B&B license are subject to the EHT where the rental periods are shorter than 30 days. Option (2) is incorrect because properties which are rented for at least 30 days in a row for a minimum of six months in aggregate over the course of a year are exempt from the EHT. Options (3) and (4) are incorrect because the EHT does not apply to properties being used as a principal residence by the owner, a family member, or a friend for at least six months of the year."

Option (2) is incorrect because if a tenant has failed to give the security deposit required under the agreement within 30 days of the date it is required, the landlord is entitled to terminate the tenancy for cause by giving not less than one month written notice. Option (3) is incorrect because a landlord can enter residential premises if an emergency exists and the entry is necessary to protect life or property."

"Question 961: Which of the following statements regarding the effect of registration of a mortgage in a British Columbia land title office is TRUE? 
(1)The registration of a mortgage in the land title office is conclusive evidence that the mortgagee is entitled to an interest in the land described in the mortgage document. 
(2)A mortgage that is not registered in the land title office is unenforceable against the parties to the mortgage. 
(3)Registration of a mortgage raises only a rebuttable presumption that the mortgage is valid; a registered mortgage is not “guaranteed” under the British Columbia land registration system. 
(4)None of the above statements are true.","Answer: 3 Explanation: Option (3) is correct because the registration of a charge only raises a rebuttable presumption that the charge is valid. Unlike a registered fee simple, a registered charge is not “guaranteed”. Option (1) is incorrect because the registration of a mortgage transfers the mortgagor’s interest in land to the mortgagee as security for the repayment of the debt.

(1)substantial 
(2)unavoidable 
(3)documented 
(4)trivial",Answer: 1 Explanation: Option (1) is correct because a conflict of interest arises when there is a substantial risk that the agent’s representation of a client would be negatively affected by the agent’s own interest or by the agent’s duties to another. Option (2) is incorrect because some conflicts of interest can be avoided. Option (3) is incorrect because conflicts of interest can be documented or undocumented. Option (4) is incorrect because a trivial risk to a client does not create a conflict of interest by itself – the risk can be something that is more than trivial.

(1)Natural features, such as trees and streams 
(2)Moveable objects such as furniture 
(3)Land 
(4)Manmade improvements, such as buildings","Answer: 2 Explanation: Option (2) is correct because movable objects such as furniture are not normally included in the concept of real property, but instead are considered personal property.

Each strata lot has a higher assessment value than Helen’s current detached home. Helen may apply for a special assessment for her home to be assessed based on its current residential use.","Answer: 1 Explanation: Option (1) is correct (false) because there is no single statute law governing the real property tax system in BC. The Assessment Act is one of the sources of property law, but not the only source. Option (2) is incorrect (true) since Helen, as the registered owner, is no longer living in the Vancouver property, she is not eligible for the basic home owner grant. Option (3) is incorrect (true); if a property has been incorrectly assessed, anyone, including a municipal council, can file an appeal to the Property Assessment Review Panels under the Assessment Act.

(3)The “agent” is an employee and works under the direct control and supervision of their principal. 
(4)None of the above statements are true.","Answer: 4 Explanation: Option (4) is correct because none of the other statements are true. Option (1) is incorrect because the interests of the agent do not take priority over those of the principal.

"Question 971: A landlord has rented an apartment to a tenant under a one year tenancy agreement. Three days ago, at the beginning of the third month of the term, the tenant failed to pay rent as due. What action can the landlord take? 
(1)The landlord may immediately enter the leased premises and seize the tenant’s furniture of sufficient value to equal the amount of rent owing. 
(2)The landlord is prohibited by law from terminating this fixed term lease; it must continue until its expiry date. The landlord’s only remedy is to take the matter to arbitration. 
(3)The landlord may now give the tenant 10 days written notice of the end of the tenancy agreement, and the tenant may avoid termination by paying the overdue rent within 5 days of receiving the notice. 
(4)The agreement is now void because of the tenant’s breach of one its fundamental covenants, i.e., the requirement to pay rent.","Answer: 3 Explanation: Option (3) is correct because section 46 of the Residential Tenancy Act provides that a landlord can give a notice of the end of the tenancy agreement to a tenant who does not pay the rent when it is due, which is cancelled if the tenant pays the rent owing within 5 days of receiving the notice. Option (1) is incorrect because section 26 of the Residential Tenancy Act abolishes the remedy of distress (seizing a tenant’s goods and eventually selling them to satisfy a claim for rent owing) in residential tenancies. Option (2) is incorrect because non-payment of rent allows a landlord to terminate a fixed term tenancy agreement. Option (4) is incorrect because failure to pay rent does not make the tenancy agreement void."
"Question 972: Which of the following statements about easements is TRUE? 
(1)Only the land owner and not the land benefits from an easement. 
(2)The granting of an easement by one landowner to another conveys ownership of the easement area to the dominant tenement owner. 
(3)Where a right or privilege over land benefits a long established trade on a dominant tenement, this has been held by the court in some cases to be sufficient to create an easement. 
(4)A tenant who occupies land under a 20 year lease can grant an easement to a neighbouring property owner and the easement, if registered in the land title office, will run with the land even after the lease expires.","Answer: 3 Explanation: Option (3) is correct because an implied easement may result if the intention of the parties granting the easement has not been sufficiently explicit. Option (1) is incorrect because the land receiving the benefit is called the dominant tenement. Option (2) is incorrect because the dominant tenement owner does not receive an ownership of the easement area, but rather has an interest in the land less than ownership. Option (4) is incorrect because an easement can only be granted by the owner of the servient tenement, not by a tenant who occupies the land under a lease."
"Question 973: Joan was considering putting in an offer on a farm in Peachland, British Columbia for $130,000, subject to arranging suitable financing. She approached Peachy Credit Union for pre-approval of a mortgage loan, and Peachy hired A and; A Appraisers to determine the value of the farm for mortgage purposes. A and; A appraised the property at $135,000 and Peachy Credit Union approved a mortgage loan of $101,250 to Joan, who then went ahead with the purchase. Eleven months later the bank was forced to foreclose on the property and upon obtaining another appraisal, found that the market value of the property was only $70,000. It is found that A and; A was negligent in its appraisal report. What remedies, if any, are available to Joan and Peachy Credit Union? 
(1)Peachy Credit Union can sue A and; A for breach of contract, but Joan has no case against A and; A.

(3)Peachy Credit Union can sue A and; A for breach of contract and Joan can sue A and; A under tort law. 
(4)No remedies are available to either Joan or Peachy Credit Union.","Answer: 3 Explanation: Option (3) is the correct answer.

The appraisal contract is between A & A and Peachy Credit Union, and an implied term in the contract is the appraisal report be carefully prepared according to accepted appraisal practices. Due to the unacceptable error, it is clear that this contract has been breached by A & A. There is no contract between A & A and Joan, but it is reasonable that Joan may rely on this appraisal report. Given the unacceptable error, A & A may be liable to Joan for the tort of negligence.

(1)The interest that accrues on a security deposit is always paid to the account of the landlord. 
(2)The amount of a security deposit may be freely negotiated between the two parties to a commercial lease. 
(3)The interest rate on a security deposit is restricted by the federal Interest Act. 
(4)Security deposits must not exceed 150% of the monthly rent as a higher amount is unconscionable and therefore illegal.","Answer: 2 Explanation: Option (2) is correct because there are no legal restrictions regarding security deposits, so this is an item left open for negotiation. Option (1) is incorrect because it is up for negotiation who is entitled to the interest which accrues on a security deposit.

(1)A licensee can protect themselves from all liability for misrepresentation by having the vendor complete and sign a disclosure statement at the time the property is listed. 
(2)A licensee will not be liable for the tort of fraudulent misrepresentation unless they have some expertise in the particular area. 
(3)A licensee will be vicariously liable to a buyer for incorrect information given by the licensee to the vendor who passed the information on to the buyer. 
(4)A licensee is not required to provide opinions to buyers on areas outside their expertise; rather, it is the buyer’s responsibility to seek the opinion of a qualified expert.",Answer: 4 Explanation: Option (4) is correct because licensees are not required to provide opinions to buyers on areas outside of their expertise. Option (1) is incorrect because a disclosure statement will not protect licensees from all misrepresentations. Option (2) is incorrect because a licensee can be liable for the tort of fraudulent misrepresentation even if he or she does not have expertise in that area. Option (3) is incorrect because vicarious liability does not arise between the licensee and the vendor.

(1)The listing licensee must disclose that material latent defect to the buyer.

(3)The listing licensee must follow the seller’s instructions and withhold disclosure to potential buyers. 
(4)The listing licensee must refuse to provide further trading services to or on behalf of that client in respect of the trade in real estate.","Answer: 4 Explanation: Option (4) is correct because if a seller instructs a listing licensee not to disclose a material latent defect to a potential buyer of the property, the licensee must refuse to provide further trading services to or on behalf of that client in respect of the trade in real estate. Option (1) is incorrect because as an agent, the listing licensee owes a duty to follow his or her principal’s instructions. The listing licensee must therefore discontinue acting for the principal, rather than disregard the principal’s instructions. Option (2) is incorrect because the British Columbia Financial Services Authority governs licensees’ conduct; it does not govern consumers’ conduct. Option (3) is incorrect because the listing licensee cannot act upon instructions that would result in a misrepresentation of the property or in a violation of federal, provincial, or local law."
"Question 977: A mortgage broker has helped you set up a mortgage loan. The loan is for $250,000 at an interest rate of j12 = 4.5% and a 20-year amortization. The loan calls for monthly payments of $1,582 over a 3-year term with $225,208.61 owing at the end of 3 years. If the lender pays the broker a fee of 2% of the funds advanced, what is the yield to the lender, expressed as an effective annual rate (j1)? 
(1)4.485244% 
(2)3.228752%

Therefore, the lender is being slightly underpaid with each payment. Given the inverse relationship between interest rates and present value, if the present value rises, then the interest rate drops."

(2)let the former decision stand. 
(3)beyond the powers. 
(4)decisions must be equitable.","Answer: 2 Explanation: Option (2) is correct and Options (1), (3), and (4) are incorrect because stare decisis literally means “let the former decision stand”, which requires courts to adhere to principles laid down by previous courts where the facts are substantially the same."
"Question 979: Tina had a listing on a house that she wanted to sell to Tom. Tom didn’t want to make an offer on Tina’s listing because his own house had not sold.

Tom, now suffering from buyer’s remorse, is unhappy with the arrangement, and has reported Tina to the British Columbia Financial Services Authority (BCFSA) Which of the following statements is/are TRUE? 
(1)Tina did nothing wrong in making this promise because she provided all the terms of the promise in writing, to Tom, prior to his entering the contract of purchase and sale. 
(2)Tina is in breach of the Real Estate Services Act, because it prohibits licensees from promising to purchase property in order to induce a buyer to enter a contract. 
(3)Tina is liable to be disciplined by BCFSA since her behaviour qualifies as misconduct as a licensee. 
(4)Both (2) and (3) are true.","Answer: 1 Explanation: Option (1) is correct because although section 49 of the Real Estate Services Rules places limitations on when licensees can make promises to purchase property to induce a buyer to enter a contract, Tina complied with these limitations because she provided all the terms of the promise in writing to Tom before he entered into the contract of purchase and sale. Option (2) is incorrect because Tina did not breach the Real Estate Services Act. Option (3) is incorrect because Tina did not engage in misconduct and is not liable to be disciplined by the British Columbia Financial Services Authority.

"Question 980: Andrew forged a mortgage and registered it against the fee simple title of Julia, without her knowledge. Andrew then went to the Handy Dandy finance company and sold the mortgage to them. Wendy, an employee of Handy Dandy, searched the title and ascertained that Andrew was the registered mortgagee, prior to buying the mortgage from Andrew. Subsequently, Julia learned of the mortgage when Handy Dandy sent notice to her instructing her to make her payments in future to Handy Dandy. Julia told Handy Dandy that she had never granted a mortgage to anyone, and that she had no intention of paying them anything. Andrew is now living happily in Bolivia. Which of the following statements is TRUE? 
(1)Handy Dandy’s mortgage is protected under the Land Title Act, since they dealt with the registered holder of the mortgage, and relied on the register. 
(2)Julia will be obliged to repay the mortgage to Handy Dandy, but she will be entitled to recover that amount from the assurance fund. 
(3)Handy Dandy will not be able to recover the mortgage debt from Julia, but they will be able to recover the amount of the mortgage from the assurance fund. 
(4)Julia will be able to have Handy Dandy’s mortgage removed from her title, and Handy Dandy will have no recourse, except against Andrew.","Answer: 4 Explanation: Option (4) is correct because registered charges are not indefeasible, but rather only raise a rebuttable presumption that the charge is valid. An innocent purchaser of any interest less than a fee simple estate in land may not rely on the land title system as being conclusive proof of ownership. Option (1) is incorrect because registered charges are not indefeasible. Option (2) is incorrect because Julia is able to have the mortgage removed from her title, and so is not obliged to repay the mortgage or recover from the assurance fund. Option (3) is incorrect because Handy Dandy is not entitled to recover the amount of the mortgage from the assurance fund because courts have found that the cost of fraud should not be borne by the public but should instead be the responsibility of the lenders themselves."

(2)Real property is immobile. 
(3)Ownership of real property may be divided both physically and legally.

(4)Trespass usually occurs once or twice, whereas nuisance usually involves repeated or continuous occurrences.","Answer: 3 Explanation: Option (3) is correct because the plaintiff does not have to prove an interference with the use and enjoyment of their land and physical damage to property to bring a successful claim for trespass. Options (1), (2), and (4) are incorrect because these are all true statements."
"Question 988: What will be the maximum loan granted on a commercial building with a lending value of $4,250,000 and yielding a net operating income of $212,500 per year, where the lender requires a debt coverage ratio of 1.3 and a 65% loan-to-value ratio? The loan will be amortized over 25 years with annual payments and the interest rate is 6.5% per annum, compounded annually. Round your answer to the nearest $1,000. 
(1)$1,994,000 
(2)$2,997,000 
(3)$1,592,000 
(4)$2,763,000","Answer: 1 Explanation: The maximum loan granted will be the lower amount of the loan-to-value constraint and the DCR constraint. Using DCR constraint, calculate maximum allowable payments."
"Question 989: Jake has owned an industrial toxic waste disposal plant in Vancouver for a number of years. The area in which the plant is located was rezoned one year ago and the applicable zoning bylaws do not permit a waste disposal land use. The residents of Vancouver are lobbying the city council to close down the plant. Which of the following statements is TRUE? 
(1)The plant is a legal non-conforming use of the land that may continue indefinitely. 
(2)The plant is a legal non-conforming use of the land that may continue until Jake sells the property. 
(3)The Planning Act establishes the circumstances under which non-conforming uses may continue. 
(4)If Jake wants to sell the plant, most buyers will require him to take steps to make the use a legal one by obtaining a bylaw amendment called a land use contract for the site.","Answer: 1 Explanation: Option (1) is correct because the plant was conforming to the bylaw prior to the rezoning, and so it will be “grandfathered” as a legal non-conforming use. Option (2) is incorrect because a non-conforming use may continue through successive changes of ownership. Option (3) is incorrect because the Local Government Act, not the Planning Act, establishes the circumstances under which non-conforming uses may continue. Option (4) is incorrect because land use contracts can no longer be created; rather, the use could continue as a legal non-conforming use or the property owner could apply to have the area rezoned."
"Question 990: Eugene and Lenore visited Green Maple Tree Farms. The property is owned and operated by Rodney. Trees kept for sale are placed in holes in the ground, with their roots encased in burlap. The holes are not filled in when a tree is removed, but are located in a grid pattern, which is apparent to any viewer. Signs are located at the beginning and end of every row of trees warning customers to watch for and avoid open holes. Eugene and Lenore walked among the rows of trees while selecting a tree for their purchase. Eugene and Lenore noticed an open hole (approximately 3 feet in diameter). Lenore walked around the hole and Eugene attempted to step across the hole. Eugene fell into the hole and fractured his leg. Shortly after this event, Lenore tripped over a green garden hose lying unseen in the grass between the rows of trees, which was left by Rodney earlier in the day. Lenore broke her arm in her fall. Which of the following statements is TRUE? 
(1)Rodney is liable to both Eugene and Lenore for their injuries suffered as a result of his breach of the duty of care owed to them under the Occupiers Liability Act. 
(2)Rodney can successfully defend against a lawsuit by both Eugene and Lenore, using the defence contained in the Occupiers Liability Act that an occupier has no duty of care to a person in respect of risks willingly accepted by that person as their own risks. 
(3)Eugene will probably not recover any damages in a lawsuit against Rodney because he breached his duty to take reasonable care for his own safety; he was the author of his own harm. 
(4)Rodney will not be liable for either Eugene or Lenore’s injuries if he was not at Green Maple Tree Farms at the time that the injuries occurred.","Answer: 3 Explanation: Option (3) is correct because occupiers are entitled to assume that a visitor will exercise reasonable care for their own safety. Because Eugene breached this duty, he will probably not recover any damages against Rodney. Option (1) is incorrect because Rodney is likely not liable to Eugene for his injuries. Option (2) is incorrect because Lenore’s injury from tripping on the garden hose was a direct result of Rodney’s negligence, and she did not willingly assume these risks, so Rodney will likely be liable for her injuries. Option (4) is incorrect because Rodney is still an occupier of the premises even if he is not physically present when the injuries in question occurred."
"Question 991: Ethan visited a used car lot, owned and operated by Clara. The lot contains a variety of used cars, in addition to a marked off area where Clara keeps a variety of car parts. There are large signs around the marked off area, warning customers not to enter the area without the presence of an employee. Ethan, while walking around the lot, noticed a set of vintage car wheels in the marked off area. Disregarding the signage, Ethan entered the area to get a closer look at the wheels. Unfortunately, Ethan stepped on a small engine part that was lying on the ground and slipped and broke his ankle. Which of the following statements is TRUE? 
(1)If Ethan had been trespassing on Clara’s lot, Ethan would have been owed no duty of care whatsoever under the Occupiers Liability Act. 
(2)If Ethan was an infant, he would likely be owed a higher duty of care than an adult because of an infant’s relative inability to appreciate the danger presented by marked off areas in a used car lot. 
(3)Clara could not be held liable to Ethan if she was merely leasing the lot; only the owner of the land can be sued under the Occupiers Liability Act. 
(4)If Clara had an employee supervise the lot, and Clara was away from the lot at the time of the injury, only the employee can be held liable under the Occupiers Liability Act.","Answer: 2 Explanation: Option (2) is correct because the Occupiers Liability Act requires an occupier of premises to take care that is reasonable in all of the circumstances to ensure that a person will be reasonably safe in using the premises. If Ethan was a child, it is likely that it would be found reasonable that he could not have read the sign, and so the occupier would have been required to do more to ensure he was reasonably safe. Option (1) is incorrect, because a visitor is deemed to have willingly assumed all risks only if trespassing while also committing or having the intention to commit a criminal act. Even if a person has willingly assumed all risks, an occupier still has a duty not to create a danger with intent to do harm to the person, or act with reckless disregard to the safety of the person. Option (3) is incorrect because the Occupiers Liability Act provides that an occupier is liable, and if Clara was leasing the lot, she could still be an occupier under the Act if she was in physical possession of the premises, or had responsibility for, and control over, the condition of the premises, the activities conducted on those premises, and the persons allowed to enter those premises. Option (4) is incorrect because as long as Clara is deemed an occupier under the Act, then she would be liable even if she was away from the lot at the time of the injury."
"Question 992: A new furnace that Sally installed in her house exploded six months after installation. Sally intends to bring a lawsuit against the manufacturer. What is the first document that Sally’s lawyer will file? 
(1)A response to civil claim 
(2)A notice of trial 
(3)A notice of civil claim 
(4)A garnishing order","Answer: 3 Explanation: Option (3) is correct and Options (1), (2), and (4) are incorrect because filing a notice of civil claim is the first step to in bringing a claim."
"Question 993: Which of the following appears in the “Description of Land” section of a Land Title Search in British Columbia? 
(1)Civic street address of the property 
(2)Parcel identifier, or PID 
(3)Dimensions of the parcel of land 
(4)Geodetic coordinates for each corner of the property","Answer: 2 Explanation: Option (2) is correct because the parcel identifier (PID) is listed under the “Description of Land” section of a title search. Options (1), (3) and (4) are incorrect because these items are not listed on a title search."
"Question 994: Which of the following results from the immobility of land? 
(1)A large older home is divided into four separate suites, and each is sold as a unit. 
(2)A piece of land is zoned as parkland, thereby increasing the value of nearby homes. 
(3)There is no licensing requirement for appraisers. 
(4)The economic life of a building may be shorter than its physical life.","Answer: 2 Explanation: Option (2) is correct because the immobile nature of land causes real property to be more influenced by externalities. Options (1), (3), and (4) are incorrect as they do not describe externalities resulting from land’s immobility."
"Question 995: A company pays $97,635 for an asset on which the Income Tax Act allows capital cost allowance at 5% per year. The asset is expected to have a useful life of 25 years and will have no salvage value at the end of this time. Calculate the depreciation expense for accounting purposes for the asset’s third year if the accountant chooses to use straight-line depreciation. 
(1)$3,913.40 
(2)$4,185.49 
(3)$4,521.72 
(4)$3,905.40","Answer: 4 Explanation: In this question, straight-line means that each year the expense will be the same. We ignore CCA."
"Question 996: Which of the following statements about fixtures and chattels is FALSE? 
(1)When a chattel becomes attached, even slightly, to real property, it is presumed to be considered a fixture unless circumstances show that the item was intended to remain a chattel. 
(2)A seller of real property has the right to detach and remove any fixture after entering the contract of purchase and sale, if they so desire. 
(3)When an owner of a house attaches a mirror to the wall, to better use the mirror, they will usually be entitled to remove the mirror when the house is sold and the seller moves out. 
(4)If an object cannot be removed without damaging the real property, this is an indication that the object is a fixture.","Answer: 2 Explanation: Option (2) is correct because items that are fixtures are considered part of the land and will belong to the buyer upon completion. Therefore, a seller of real property does not have the right to detach and remove any fixture after entering the contract of purchase and sale. Option (1) is incorrect because an object “prima facie” is considered a fixture once it is even slightly attached to real property, unless it is shown that it was intended to remain a chattel. Option (3) is incorrect because if an object is attached to the real property for the better use of the mirror, the owner will usually be entitled to remove the object (as it is considered a chattel) when the house is sold. Option (4) is incorrect because if an object cannot be removed without damaging the real property, then this is an indication that it is likely to be considered a fixture."
"Question 997: Which one of the following is NOT a reason why an investor would use borrowed funds instead of an all cash offer for a real estate investment? 
(1)To diversify investments and reduce overall risk 
(2)To get a regular and predictable return on capital 
(3)To invest the borrowed funds at a higher rate of interest than the borrowing rate 
(4)Lack of adequate capital to make the desired investment","Answer: 2 Explanation: Option (2) is correct. Choosing debt financing instead of equity financing will not change the predictability of return on capital. Options (1), (3), and (4) are incorrect because they are valid reasons to choose debt financing over equity financing."
"Question 998: Which of the following is a common law source of duties to clients? 
(1)The Real Estate Services Act 
(2)The Real Estate Services Regulation 
(3)Agency/fiduciary law 
(4)The Real Estate Services Rules","Answer: 3 Explanation: Option (3) is correct because agency/fiduciary law is an example of a common law source of duties to clients. Options (1), (2), and (4) are incorrect because they are examples of legislative duties to clients."
"Question 999: Mimi was house-sitting for her friends Tom and Lizzie while they were on a three month photo-safari in Africa. The front porch was damaged in a freak storm that caused a tree to fall and smash the bottom two steps. Mimi didn’t have the money to hire a carpenter to repair the stairs, so she attached a large sign to the bottom of the steps reading, “DANGER KEEP OFF”. Dave, an out of work handyman who could not read English, was walking from house to house in the neighbourhood looking for casual work. He entered Tom and Lizzie’s property, and not understanding the sign started up the steps to the front door. Dave landed on the damaged step, and the weight of his body was more than the step could stand. He broke his leg in two places, and having no insurance, has run up $3,750 in medical bills. Dave now intends to begin a lawsuit. Which of the following statements is FALSE? 
(1)Under the Occupiers Liability Act, both Mimi and the absent owners qualify as “occupiers.” 
(2)Dave will be unsuccessful in his lawsuit because he willingly accepted the risk of injury when he walked up the broken steps. 
(3)The duty of care owed by an occupier under the Occupiers Liability Act applies in relation to the condition of the premises, activities on the premises, or the conduct of third parties on the premises. 
(4)A court will consider the reasonableness of the occupier’s actions in order to establish liability in this case.","Answer: 2 Explanation: Option (2) is correct because Dave is not trespassing while committing or intending to commit a criminal act (as he was merely looking for casual work). Dave also does not fall under any of the other enumerated categories of visitors who are deemed to have willingly assumed all the risks of entering on a property under section 3 of the Occupiers Liability Act. Option (1) is incorrect because Mimi is an occupier since she is in “physical possession of the premises”, and the absent owners remain occupiers because they still have “responsibility for, and control over” the property. (There may be more than one occupier of the same premises as per section 1 of the Occupiers Liability Act.) Option (3) is incorrect because section 3(2) of the Occupiers Liability Act states that the duty of care imposed on occupiers applies in relation to the: (a) condition of the premises; (b) activities on the premises; or (c) conduct of third parties on the premises. Option (4) is incorrect because the duty of care imposed by the Occupiers Liability Act on an occupier is to take such care as in all the circumstances is reasonable to see that persons coming onto the property will be reasonably safe."
