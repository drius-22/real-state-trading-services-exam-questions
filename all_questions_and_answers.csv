"Question 1: Latent defects are defects that are unknown to the buyer and that are: 
(1)immediately visible to the eye of the average person. 
(2)required to be disclosed by the buyer to the seller. 
(3)immediately visible to the eye of the average person. 
(4)not discoverable upon a reasonable inspection of the property.",Answer: 4 Explanation: Option (4) is correct because a latent defect is a defect which is not immediately discoverable upon a reasonable inspection of the property. Option (1) is incorrect because a defect immediately visible to the eye is a patent defect. Option (2) is incorrect because a latent defect is required to be disclosed by the seller not the buyer. Option (3) is incorrect because a latent defect is the responsibility of the seller to disclose.
"Question 2: Real property is said to be more subject to the effects of externalities than most assets. This vulnerability is principally due to: 
(1)the relatively high cost of real property. 
(2)the fact that land is fixed in supply. 
(3)the relatively high cost of real property. 
(4)the lack of effective government regulations.","Answer: 3 Explanation: Option (3) is correct because the immobility of land renders real property more subject real property to the effects of externalities than most assets. An owner cannot move his or her real property to a more desirable location with beneficial externalities. Similarly, an owner cannot move his or her property away from a location subject or negative externalities. This characteristic of land has the greatest effect on the value of a real property asset. Options (1), (2), and (4) are therefore incorrect."
"Question 3: Which of the following is NOT a “real estate service” under the Real Estate Services Act? 
(1)Constructing a commercial office building in Prince George for an owner who lives in British Columbia 
(2)Collecting rents from tenants in a residential building in Burnaby for an owner who lives in Singapore 
(3)Constructing a commercial office building in Prince George for an owner who lives in British Columbia 
(4)Assisting in the sale of a condominium unit located in Vancouver but owned by a person who lives in Calgary",Answer: 1 Explanation: Option (1) is correct because construction of a building is not a real estate service under the Real Estate Services Act. Option (2) is incorrect because collecting rents from tenants is defined as “rental property management services” which fall under “real estate services” in the Real Estate Services Act. Options (3) and (4) are incorrect because selling or assisting in the sale of properties is defined as “trading services” which fall under “real estate services” in the Real Estate Services Act.
"Question 4: Which of the following statements is TRUE regarding sole proprietorships, partnerships, and corporations? 
(1)Only sole proprietors need to report business income on their personal income tax returns. 
(2)Only partners of a partnership need to report business income on their personal tax returns. 
(3)Only sole proprietors need to report business income on their personal income tax returns. 
(4)A corporation is a separate legal entity with its own income tax status.",Answer: 4 Explanation: Option (4) is correct; corporations are subject to income tax as a separate legal entity. Options (1) and (2) are incorrect because both sole proprietors and partners need to report their business income on their personal income tax returns. Option (3) is incorrect because corporations have different tax liability from proprietors and partners in that corporations are taxed as a separate legal entity.
"Question 5: Consider a situation in which the principal is the seller and the agent is the listing agent. Which of the following events will terminate the real estate agency relationship? 
(1)The principal’s refusal to accept an offer to purchase presented by the agent where the offer exactly complies with the requirements in the listing contract 
(2)An act of the principal that is inconsistent with the continuation of the agent’s authority 
(3)The principal’s refusal to accept an offer to purchase presented by the agent where the offer exactly complies with the requirements in the listing contract 
(4)The revocation of an offer to purchase by the offeror before the principal can accept it","Answer: 2 Explanation: Option (2) is correct because a real estate agency relationship depends on mutual consent, and therefore either party can terminate the relationship at will. An agent’s authority can be revoked orally or by conduct, and an act of the principal that is inconsistent with the continuation of authority terminates the relationship. Options (1) and (4) are incorrect because these scenarios do not terminate the agency relationship. They relate to the principal’s duty to pay real estate commission to the agent. Option (3) is incorrect because an agent’s offer to personally purchase the principal’s property is a conflict of interest. While such conflicts should be avoided, they do not terminate the agency relationship."
"Question 6: A $170,000 mortgage loan, written at a nominal rate of 7% per annum, compounded annually, has a 2-year contractual term. Payments are made monthly and are based on a 20-year amortization period. Payments are rounded to the next higher dollar. What is the size of the required payments? 
(1)$1,307

"Question 7: Before adopting, amending, or repealing a zoning bylaw, a municipal council as a matter of policy will: 
(1)obtain the approval of the federal government. 
(2)obtain the approval of the provincial government. 
(3)obtain the approval of the federal government. 
(4)hold a public hearing.","Answer: 4 Explanation: Option (4) is correct because a municipal council will hold a public hearing before adopting, amending or repealing a bylaw. Options (1) and (2) are incorrect because the power to zone has been delegated to the municipality by the Province, and the Province has not retained the right to decide zoning matters. Option (3) is incorrect because a municipal council typically issues notice of a public hearing to neighbouring properties, but no specified written notice is required."
"Question 8: Which of the following might be the subject of a real property appraisal? 
(1)Air space rights 
(2)A life insurance policy 
(3)Air space rights 
(4)A home owner’s insurance policy","Answer: 1 Explanation: Option (1) is correct because the subject of a real property appraisal is the particular rights of ownership vested in a certain piece of real estate. Air space rights are a legal interest in real property. Options (2), (3), and (4) are incorrect because these do not describe legal interests in real property."
"Question 9: When commencing a lawsuit in small claims court, the plaintiff may originate the action in which of the following jurisdictions? 
(1)Where either the plaintiff resides or the defendant resides 
(2)Where the plaintiff resides only 
(3)Where either the plaintiff resides or the defendant resides 
(4)Where either the cause of action arose or the plaintiff resides","Answer: 3 Explanation: Option (3) is correct because the plaintiff may originate an action either in the jurisdiction where the circumstances giving rise to the claim arose, or in the jurisdiction where the defendant resides or carries on business. Options (1), (2), and (4) are incorrect for this reason."
"Question 10: The principle that the person named on a particular certificate of title is entitled to a fee simple interest in that property, free from any condition or encumbrance that is not shown on title, is known as the: 
(1)assurance principle. 
(2)entitlement principle. 
(3)assurance principle. 
(4)indefeasibility principle.","Answer: 4 Explanation: Option (4) is correct and (1), (2), and (3) are incorrect because the principle of indefeasibility means that if a person is named on a certificate of title as the owner of the fee simple estate in land, then that is conclusive proof, as far as the world is concerned, that he or she is entitled to that fee simple estate."
"Question 11: In the event that the tenant abandons a commercial premises, the landlord is best advised to notify the tenant that the landlord intends to enter into possession of the premises solely to re-let on the tenant’s account: 
(1)or else the doctrine of frustration will be applied to the situation. 
(2)to avoid the tenant having grounds for an action in trespass. 
(3)or else the doctrine of frustration will be applied to the situation. 
(4)because otherwise the landlord will be breaching the covenant of quiet enjoyment.","Answer: 3 Explanation: Option (3) is correct because if the landlord notifies the tenant of entry to re-let the premises, he will not lose his rights against the tenant. Option (1) is incorrect because the doctrine of frustration only applies when events outside of the control of the parties fundamentally change the subject matter of the contract. In this case, an abandonment of commercial premises would not frustrate the contract. Option (2) is incorrect because even if the landlord did not provide notice, the tenant would not have grounds for an action in trespass, as the landlord has a right to enter incidental to the right to levy a distress. Option (4) is incorrect because the covenant of quiet enjoyment protects the tenant’s right to the premises. Here, the tenant has abandoned the premises and the landlord would not be breaching the covenant by entering the premises."
"Question 12: Which of the following elements are NOT considered in determining appropriate rates of interest on mortgage loans? 
(1)The credit rating of the borrower 
(2)The type of property used for security 
(3)The credit rating of the borrower 
(4)The amount of property insurance","Answer: 4 Explanation: Option (4) is correct because the amount of property insurance does not affect the risk to the lender, and therefore will not be considered in determining the appropriate rate. Options (1) and (2) are incorrect because the borrower’s credit rating and the type of property affect the risk of the loan to the lender. Option (3) is incorrect because a lender will set an appropriate rate of return based on the risk of lending, as well as the amount of administrative work required."
"Question 13: Where a commercial tenancy is expressed as lasting for a period of one year and terminating on a fixed date, how much notice must be given to terminate the tenancy? 
(1)No notice is required. 
(2)Thirty days’ notice is required. 
(3)No notice is required. 
(4)Reasonable notice is required.","Answer: 1 Explanation: Option (1) is correct because a commercial lease for a fixed term terminates at the end of the term, on the specified end date. Options (2), (3), and (4) are incorrect for this reason."
"Question 14: Which of the following is NOT a possible meaning of the term “common law”? 
(1)The law created by the courts as opposed to statute law 
(2)The principles derived from the common law courts in England as opposed to the principles derived from the courts of Chancery 
(3)The law created by the courts as opposed to statute law 
(4)The system of law which relies upon the principle of stare decisis for its development","Answer: 3 Explanation: Option (3) is the correct answer because it is not a possible meaning of the term “common law”. The body of laws created by the Federal government (i.e., by the federal legislature) is referred to as statute law. Option (1) is incorrect because the term “common law” often broadly refers to the law created by the courts, based in either common-law or equitable principles. Option (2) is incorrect because another possible meaning of “common law” is the original set of court-developed principles, which evolved separately from equitable principles, before these two courts merged. Option (4) is incorrect because the doctrine of stare decisis underlies the binding nature of precedent within the common law."
"Question 15: On May 3, Mary offered to buy Harvey’s house, and the offer was stated to be open for acceptance until 2:00 p.m. May 4. Which one of the following statements is FALSE? 
(1)Mary can revoke her offer prior to 2:00 p.m. on May 4. 
(2)Mary’s offer represents an option agreement. 
(3)Mary can revoke her offer prior to 2:00 p.m. on May 4. 
(4)If Mary mails a notice of revocation to Harvey, the offer is only revoked if the notice is received by Harvey before he accepts.","Answer: 2 Explanation: Option (2) is the correct answer because it is false. Separate consideration needs to be given to create an option agreement and keep the offer open. Option (1) is incorrect because it is true – revocation of an offer can happen at any time prior to the expiration of the offer. Option (3) is incorrect because any changes that Harvey makes to the offer would be considered a counter-offer. A counter-offer must be accepted by Mary, so it effectively terminates her original offer. Option (4) is incorrect because revocation must actually be communicated to Harvey. There is no “postal acceptance rule” with regards to revocation."
"Question 16: Mike bought a house two years ago at which time he arranged a $110,000 mortgage. This loan was written at a nominal rate of 9.5% per annum, compounded semi-annually, with a 10-year term and amortization period, and monthly payments of $1,413. Today Mike has received an offer from Andre to buy his house for $50,000 cash plus assumption of his mortgage. If current mortgage rates for similar mortgages are 12% per annum, compounded semi-annually, what is the market value of Andre’s offer, rounded to the nearest dollar? 
(1)$127,146 
(2)$137,795 
(3)$127,146 
(4)$89,792","Answer: 2 Explanation: Find the new PV, given that the payments remain at $1,413, but the market value of the mortgage changes because the new rates are 12% per annum, compounded semi-annually. This rate is higher than the contract rate; therefore, we would expect the PV of the loan to be lower. Also, we only have 8 years, or 96 N, left on the mortgage.

"Question 17: Which of the following contractual clauses in a mortgage could apply where the mortgage is otherwise in good standing but the borrower has not paid their property taxes? 
(1)A “further charges” clause 
(2)A “repayment” clause 
(3)A “further charges” clause 
(4)An “omnibus” clause","Answer: 4 Explanation: Option (4) is correct because an omnibus clause allows the mortgagee to pay monies to be paid by the mortgagor (e.g., property taxes or strata charges) if unpaid and such amounts are added to the principal secured. Options (1), (2), and (3) are incorrect as these clauses are not applicable in such a situation."
"Question 18: Which of the following items is NOT an example of a technological compatibility issue? 
(1)A licensee cannot access a forms software because it is not compatible with her computer’s operating system. 
(2)A licensee sends a form to a property seller from a mobile phone, and the seller is able to fill it out from her desktop computer. 
(3)A licensee cannot access a forms software because it is not compatible with her computer’s operating system. 
(4)A licensee has to enter the same property information into three different programs because the programs are not compatible with one another.","Answer: 2 Explanation: Option (2) is the correct answer because the form is compatible across mobile devices, therefore it is not an example of a technological capability issue. Options (1), (3), and (4) are all examples of technological compatibility issues and are therefore incorrect."
"Question 19: A developer is selling a development unit of subdivided land situated in British Columbia and the developer has obtained a written statement from the purchaser acknowledging that the buyer has read the appropriate disclosure statement. If the purchase agreement is then entered into, the buyer: 
(1)may serve notice to rescind the contract no later than three days from the date of the contract. 
(2)may serve notice to rescind the contract no later than seven days from the date of the contract. 
(3)may serve notice to rescind the contract no later than three days from the date of the contract. 
(4)may not rescind the contract.","Answer: 2 Explanation: Option (2) is correct because there is a seven day rescission right whereby the purchaser can serve written notice of rescission seven days after giving a written statement that they have read the disclosure statement. Options (1), (3), and (4) are incorrect for this reason."
"Question 20: Which of the following statements is TRUE? 
(1)Real estate appraisers must be licensed in British Columbia. 
(2)With an unusual property or a market with few participants, the margin of error in an appraiser’s estimate of market value is always 5% or lower. 
(3)Real estate appraisers must be licensed in British Columbia. 
(4)The market value of real property as determined by an experienced appraiser may be greater than the ceiling price of the buyer.","Answer: 4 Explanation: Option (4) is true because the ceiling price of a buyer is subjective and could be any value; for example, far above the appraised value. Option (1) is incorrect as there are no licensing requirements for real estate appraisers. Option (2) is incorrect because the recognized margin of error for an appraisal of an usual property or a market with few participants will likely be much higher than 5% to 10%. Option (3) is incorrect as there is no legal requirement for a specific appraisal license or designation that would prevent a qualified licensed real estate representative from performing an appraisal."
"Question 21: Alan is Peter’s agent with the express authority to rent Peter’s cottage for the summer months. However, in his capacity as Peter’s agent, Alan accepts an offer to purchase the cottage instead. When Peter discovers the incident, he is so impressed by the price, he calls and tells the buyers that he adopts Alan’s act. Which of the following is the result of these actions at law? 
(1)Peter has ratified Alan’s actions, therefore the buyers cannot sue Alan for breach of warranty of authority. 
(2)When Peter adopted Alan’s act, he created legal authority by means of revocation. 
(3)Peter has ratified Alan’s actions, therefore the buyers cannot sue Alan for breach of warranty of authority. 
(4)None of the above","Answer: 1 Explanation: Option (1) is correct because Peter has ratified the contract, which means he has consented to the unauthorized acts of the agent. Therefore, Peter is bound by the contract just as if Alan had been authorized to make it in the first place. He cannot sue for breach of warranty of authority. Option (2) is incorrect because revocation refers to terminating authority, not creating it. Option (3) is incorrect because apparent authority arises from agency by estoppel. Agency by estoppel is not present here, as there was no representation made by Peter, reliance by a third party and an alteration of the third party’s position based on that reliance. Option (4) is incorrect because Option (1) is true."
"Question 22: You have a partially completed appraisal report that you need to fill in. The subject property has 4 bathrooms and an air conditioner. The house next door is similar in all respects except for the number of bathrooms and air conditioner. It sold for $334,000 and was adjusted +$6,700 for bathrooms and +$5,500 for the air conditioner. If the market value of a bathroom is $6,700 and the market value of an air conditioner is $5,500, you can conclude that this comparable has: 
(1)5 bathrooms and no air conditioner. 
(2)3 bathrooms and an air conditioner. 
(3)5 bathrooms and no air conditioner. 
(4)4 bathrooms and an air conditioner.","Answer: 3 Explanation: Option (3) is correct because a positive adjustment of $6,700 for bathrooms indicates that the comparable has one less bathroom than the subject property (3 bathrooms), and a positive adjustment of $5,500 for the air conditioner indicates that the comparable does not have an air conditioner. Options (1), (2), and (4) are incorrect for this reason."
"Question 23: An appeal from the small claims court is to which of the following? 
(1)The British Columbia Supreme Court 
(2)The Federal Court of Appeal 
(3)The British Columbia Supreme Court 
(4)The Small Claims Court of Appeal","Answer: 1 Explanation: Option (1) is correct because an appeal from small claims court is to the British Columbia Supreme Court. Options (2), (3), and (4) are incorrect for this reason."

The loan will be amortized over 20 years with annual payments and the interest rate is 7% per annum, compounded annually. Round your answer to the nearest $1,000. 
(1)$2,814,000 
(2)$3,330,000 
(3)$2,814,000

"Question 25: Zelda was in a good mood one day, and she went over to her next door neighbour Herb’s house and cleaned all his gutters. When Herb returned home from work, he was thrilled by what Zelda had done and he said, “Zelda, I am going to give you a case of wine for doing this.” Weeks passed, and finally Zelda asked Herb when she could expect to receive her wine. Herb said that he had changed his mind. Zelda is now furious and wants to sue Herb in small claims court for a breach of contract. Which of the following statements is most relevant to these facts? 
(1)An invitation to treat is distinguishable from an offer because it cannot form a binding contract, if accepted. 
(2)A voidable contract exists until it is repudiated by the party entitled to do so. 
(3)An invitation to treat is distinguishable from an offer because it cannot form a binding contract, if accepted. 
(4)Breach of a condition of a contract entitles the injured party to terminate the contract.","Answer: 3 Explanation: Option (3) is relevant and therefore correct because although Herb offered a case of wine as present consideration, the cleaning of the gutters was past consideration. Since past consideration is no consideration, no contract formed between Herb and Zelda. Option (1) is incorrect because an invitation to treat is typically an advertisement or other statement from one party inviting another party to make a legal offer. No invitation to treat appears in this scenario. Option (2) is incorrect because there is no voidable contract to be repudiated on the facts. Option (4) is not relevant because the issue is whether there was consideration to give rise to a valid contract in the first place."
"Question 26: Which one of the following is the generally accepted accounting principle that determines what amount will be recorded on the company’s balance sheet as the value of a building at the time of purchase? 
(1)The objectivity principle 
(2)The consistency principle 
(3)The objectivity principle 
(4)The cost principle","Answer: 4 Explanation: Option (4) is correct because the cost principle states that a company must record the value of an asset as the price paid at the time of acquisition. Option (1) is incorrect because the objectivity principle states that all values must be objective and verifiable. Option (2) is incorrect because the consistency principle states that once a company adopts a certain accounting policy, they should continue to use that same policy. Option (3) is incorrect because the revenue recognition principle states that revenue must be recorded when it is earned, not when cash is received."
"Question 27: In order for a trading services representative to be liable for a negligent misrepresentation, certain facts must be proven. Which of the following is NOT a requirement for establishing a claim based upon negligent misrepresentation? 
(1)A contractual relationship must exist between the representative and the person to whom the representation is made. 
(2)The statement may be either one of fact or an opinion given by the representative. 
(3)A contractual relationship must exist between the representative and the person to whom the representation is made. 
(4)The representative must make no clear disclaimer of liability for the accuracy of the statement.","Answer: 1 Explanation: Option (1) is correct because a contractual relationship does not need to exist between the parties when a negligent misrepresentation is made. For example, a licensee acting for a seller could be held liable for negligent misrepresentation for a statement made to a buyer despite having no contractual relationship with the buyer. Option (2) is incorrect because the statement made may be fact or opinion as the representative is a skilled person and the other party may reasonably rely on it. Option (3) is incorrect because there is a requirement of reliance on the statement and resulting damage from that reliance to establish a claim of negligent misrepresentation. Option (4) is incorrect because a representative can make a clear disclaimer that they will not be liable for the accuracy of the statement."
"Question 28: Sally, an appraiser, has been asked to provide an estimate of the market value of a farmhouse and the surrounding property. Which one of the following would NOT affect her estimate of market value? 
(1)One of the pastures on the property has been leased for two years to the owner of a racehorse. 
(2)The owner of the farmhouse is anxious to move and would like to sell as soon as possible. 
(3)One of the pastures on the property has been leased for two years to the owner of a racehorse. 
(4)Homehold Finance Company recently loaned some money, at a below-market interest rate, to the owner of the farmhouse and secured the debt with a mortgage on the farmhouse. This mortgage is assumable.","Answer: 2 Explanation: Option (2) is the correct answer as it is the only option listed that does not affect the legal rights of ownership of the property. Options (1), (3), and (4) represent legal interests or charges that will affect the appraiser’s estimate of market value."
"Question 29: The book value of an asset can be BEST defined as which of the following? 
(1)The purchase price of that asset less any depreciation taken to date 
(2)The price for which a similar asset could currently be purchased in the market 
(3)The purchase price of that asset less any depreciation taken to date 
(4)A value that is subjectively arrived at by an appraiser","Answer: 1 Explanation: Option (1) is correct because the book value of an asset is calculated as the purchase price of the asset, less all of the accumulated depreciation to date. Options (2) and (3) are incorrect as they both refer to the market value of the asset, and Option (4) is incorrect as it refers to the appraised value of an asset."
"Question 30: In the situation where a residential tenant under a fixed term tenancy abandons the premises prior to the end of the term, the obligation imposed on the landlord to try to re-rent the premises as quickly as possible is referred to as: 
(1)the duty to mitigate damages. 
(2)the covenant of quiet enjoyment. 
(3)the duty to mitigate damages. 
(4)the doctrine of interesse termini.","Answer: 1 Explanation: Option (1) is correct because the duty to mitigate damages means that the innocent party must try to reduce the loss suffered as a result of the breach. In this case, reducing the loss of income from the rent would occur by re-renting the premises as soon as possible. Options (2), (3), and (4) are incorrect as they refer to other legal principles."
"Question 31: Scrambling credit card information into an unreadable format is BEST known as which of the following? 
(1)Cryptomizing 
(2)Digitizing 
(3)Cryptomizing 
(4)Instilling","Answer: 3 Explanation: Option (3) is correct because cryptomizing information protects it by encrypting it into an unreadable format. Only those with a secret key or code can decipher the information. Options (1), (2), and (4) are incorrect for this reason."
"Question 32: Which of the following most correctly completes the phrase: “A mortgage is ...”? 
(1)a contract, evidence of a loan, and required to be registered to be effective between the parties. 
(2)a contract, evidence of a loan, and security for a loan. 
(3)a contract, evidence of a loan, and required to be registered to be effective between the parties. 
(4)a contract, evidence of a loan, security for a loan, and required to be registered to be effective between the parties.",Answer: 2 Explanation: Option (2) is correct as it describes a mortgage. Options (1) and (4) are incorrect because a mortgage does not necessarily need to be registered to be effective between the parties. This principle is embodied in section 20(1) of the Land Title Act. Option (3) is incorrect because a mortgage is not a loan. It is an interest in land created by contract as security for a loan made by a lender to the borrower.
"Question 33: Which of the following statements is FALSE? 
(1)An appraisal mistake of $3,000 on a $276,000 house is beyond the margin of allowable error. 
(2)Form reports often meet the needs of financial institutions, insurance companies, and government agencies. 
(3)An appraisal mistake of $3,000 on a $276,000 house is beyond the margin of allowable error. 
(4)An appraiser may be responsible to any party who reasonably relies on the appraisal report for the purpose it was conducted.","Answer: 1 Explanation: Option (1) is false and therefore correct, because the allowable margin of error is 10%, and the $3,000 error falls within this margin. Options (2), (3), and (4) are incorrect because these statements are all true."
"Question 34: An investment corporation purchased an apartment building on March 31, 2011 for $2,800,000. Of that $2,800,000, $1,700,000 was attributed to the building and $1,100,000 to the land. Depreciation was to be claimed at $50,000 per year for the life of the building. The building component of the property was valued on March 31, 2021, to be $2,400,000. What would be the net amount of the building appearing on the corporation’s Statement of Assets and Liabilities as at March 31, 2021? 
(1)$1,700,000 
(2)$1,200,000 
(3)$1,700,000 
(4)$1,900,000","Answer: 2 Explanation: Option (2) is correct. Land is not considered to be a depreciable asset and thus, depreciation expense is never taken on land. Depreciation expense is only taken on the building."
"Question 35: Chadwick is the listing licensee for a house. According to the Real Estate Services Rules, Chadwick does NOT need to provide his client, the seller, with a Disclosure of Interest in Trade form if the party making the offer to purchase the house is: 
(1)a corporation in which Chadwick holds 20% of the shares. 
(2)Chadwick’s wife. 
(3)a corporation in which Chadwick holds 20% of the shares. 
(4)Chadwick’s friend and tennis partner.","Answer: 4 Explanation: Option (4) is correct because a licensee is required to provide a Disclosure of Interest in Trade form when there is an offer by the licensee to directly or indirectly acquire real estate. An offer by Chad’s friend is neither of these. Option (1) is incorrect because an offer by a corporation in which Chad owns over 5% of the shares is an offer to indirectly acquire real estate. Option (2) is incorrect because an offer by Chad’s wife is also an offer to indirectly acquire real estate. Option (3) is incorrect because it is a direct offer to acquire real estate. In these three situations, Chad must provide a Disclosure of Interest in Trade form."

(1)Breach of contract 
(2)Trespass 
(3)Breach of contract

"Question 39: Which of the following is NOT required in a notice of the end of the tenancy agreement by a tenant under the Residential Tenancy Act? 
(1)Written notice signed by the tenant 
(2)The address of the premises for which the notice is given 
(3)Written notice signed by the tenant 
(4)The date of termination of the tenancy","Answer: 3 Explanation: Option (3) is correct because the occupation of the parties is not required in a notice of the end of the tenancy agreement by a tenant.

(1)The residual method 
(2)The cost approach

"Question 41: Adel is a trading services licensee acting for a developer who is purchasing large blocks of land in Vancouver for a large development. Adel purchases some lots in the area for himself and discloses his identity to the sellers as required by the Real Estate Services Act on those purchases. He does not mention the purchases to his principal, the developer. Shortly thereafter, Adel makes a profit on the resale of his lots due to the effects of his principal’s development on the real estate market. What is this an example of? 
(1)A good business deal that is perfectly acceptable at law 
(2)A use of information that will always, even with disclosure to the principal, be prohibited 
(3)A good business deal that is perfectly acceptable at law 
(4)Adel’s activities are examples of both (2) and (3)","Answer: 3 Explanation: Option (3) is correct because there is a duty on the real estate licensee to tell his or her client everything relevant to the transaction within the agent’s knowledge. In this case, because the licensee has a personal interest in the transaction, he must disclose it to the client, but the transaction is not automatically prohibited. Options (1), (2), and (4) are therefore incorrect."
"Question 42: Which of the following statements about the principles that apply to all strata developments in British Columbia is TRUE? 
(1)The Strata Property Act generally does not apply on First Nation reserve land, subject to some exceptions. 
(2)The strata division of the Civil Resolution Tribunal conducts random audits to verify the compliance of strata corporations with strata legislation. 
(3)The Strata Property Act generally does not apply on First Nation reserve land, subject to some exceptions. 
(4)Commercial and industrial strata developments are subject to a separate and enhanced subset of compliance requirements under the Strata Property Act.","Answer: 1 Explanation: Option (1) is correct because First Nation reserve land constitutes an exclusively federal undertaking under the Constitution Act, 1867, and therefore, provincial legislation such as the Strata Property Act (“SPA”) generally does not apply on such lands, subject to the leasehold landlord provisions in the SPA. Option (2) is incorrect because while the owners may apply to the Civil Resolution Tribunal (CRT) to make binding decisions when a dispute arises, the CRT’s role does not involve proactive efforts such as random audits to ensure compliance. Option (3) is incorrect because all strata corporations are required to hold annual general meetings to comply with the SPA, regardless of their size. There are, however, options for strata corporations to waive the requirement to hold an annual general meeting. Option (4) is incorrect because the same fundamental legal principles apply to all strata developments, and commercial and industrial strata developments are not subject to enhanced compliance requirements under the SPA."

(3)A three-storey condominium development that has recently been completed, all units having been sold before completion of construction 
(4)A sports store that is built on land zoned for commercial use","Answer: 2 Explanation: A property possesses latent value if its current state does not represent its highest and best use. Option (2) possesses latent value as the property would have more value if the single-family home was removed and a commercial use building was developed. Options (1), (3), and (4) are incorrect, as these properties are currently being utilized at their highest and best use."
"Question 44: Which of the following statements about the criminal offence of misleading advertising in section 52 of the Competition Act is FALSE? 
(1)The offence involves the making of a representation to the public that is false or misleading in a material respect, for the purpose of promoting any business interest. 
(2)To escape liability, one must show that they honestly believed that the representations were not false or misleading and exercised due diligence in making sure that was the case. 
(3)The offence involves the making of a representation to the public that is false or misleading in a material respect, for the purpose of promoting any business interest. 
(4)The requirement that the representation be false in a material respect refers to the whether the representation would have a real effect on an ordinary consumer’s buying decision.","Answer: 3 Explanation: Option (3) is false and therefore correct, because the representations covered by section 52 can be by “any means whatsoever” and can include oral representations. They are not limited to just print and digital representations. Options (1), (2), and (4) are true statements and are therefore incorrect."
"Question 45: Which of the following is TRUE? In a strata plan, the term “unit entitlement” refers to: 
(1)the value of each condominium unit relative to other units. 
(2)the share of the value upon demolition owned by each condominium unit owner. 
(3)the value of each condominium unit relative to other units. 
(4)the number used to calculate a strata owner’s contribution to the common expenses of the strata corporation.","Answer: 4 Explanation: Option (4) is correct as it describes the term “unit entitlement”.

"Question 47: Brad Jones, a prospective home buyer, has applied for a mortgage loan to finance the purchase of a townhouse listed at $276,000. The market value of the townhouse is $275,000 and the lender has assigned a $270,000 lending value to it. Assume that the monthly payments on Mr. Jones’ loan are agreed to be $1,120 and annual property taxes are $2,500. Calculate the minimum level of the borrower’s annual income necessary to support these monthly payments, if the lender’s gross debt service ratio is 32%.

"Question 48: The British Columbia Financial Services Authority does NOT have to: 
(1)cancel a licensee’s licence. 
(2)use funds from administrative penalties for non-educational purposes. 
(3)cancel a licensee’s licence. 
(4)apply to court to appoint a receiver over the property of a licensee.","Answer: 2 Explanation: Option (2) is correct because the BC Financial Services Authority (BCFSA) may only use funds from administrative penalties for educational purposes, and specifically, to educate the public, licensees, and other participants in the real estate industry about the operation and regulation of the industry and issues related to real estate and real estate services. The remaining options are incorrect because BCFSA has authority to exercise those powers."
"Question 49: Johnny Collins tried to design and build his new home to be as energy efficient in heating as possible throughout the cold winter months. Which one of the following decisions was a mistake? 
(1)Using metal framed windows with a thermal break 
(2)Including an air to heat exchanger to warm incoming cold exterior air 
(3)Using metal framed windows with a thermal break 
(4)Installing sliding glass doors to a north-facing patio","Answer: 4 Explanation: Option (4) is correct because it is an example of an inefficient use in heating. Large windows and doors facing south are desirable to make a home as energy efficient as possible. Options (1), (2), and (3) represent characteristics of an energy efficient home and are therefore incorrect."
"Question 50: In British Columbia, a lender who holds a mortgage registered as a charge on an otherwise clear title to a borrower’s land has: 
(1)the equitable right to redeem the mortgage. 
(2)an interest in land created by contract. 
(3)the equitable right to redeem the mortgage. 
(4)the right to retain the mortgagor’s duplicate certificate of title to the mortgaged land until the loan is repaid in full.","Answer: 2 Explanation: Option (2) is correct because it describes a mortgage. A mortgage is not a loan itself; it is an interest in land that provides security for the loan. Option (1) is incorrect because the first registered mortgage provides the lender with a legal (rather than an equitable) right of redemption. This is subject to the borrower’s equity of redemption, which allows the borrower to repay the mortgage after the contractual date for payment. Option (3) is incorrect because a mortgage lender can lose its priority over certain charges even though the mortgage was registered first. Examples of these include builders liens, Strata Property Act judgments, property tax liens, wage claim certificates and workers compensation claims. Option (4) is incorrect because retaining the mortgagor’s duplicate certificate of title to the land creates an equitable mortgage. The lender cannot register this equitable mortgage as a charge at the land title office."
"Question 51: When a mortgagor grants a mortgage after having a registered first mortgage on title, the mortgagor has created: 
(1)an equitable mortgage. 
(2)a legal mortgage. 
(3)an equitable mortgage. 
(4)a vendor take-back mortgage.","Answer: 1 Explanation: Option (1) is correct. The first registered mortgage is a legal mortgage, while any subsequent registered mortgage will be an equitable mortgage charging the borrower’s equity of redemption. Option (2) is therefore incorrect. Option (3) is incorrect because an assignment of a first mortgage is done by the lender to a third party, who is then entitled to enforce the lender’s rights directly against the borrower. Option (4) is incorrect because a vendor take-back mortgage occurs only where a purchaser of property grants a mortgage interest to the vendor of that property."
"Question 52: Which of the following statements about fee simple estate is TRUE? 
(1)Fee simple is a type of leasehold estate. 
(2)If a fee simple owner dies without a will, the property will escheat to the crown. 
(3)Fee simple is a type of leasehold estate. 
(4)The fee simple estate was created by the Torrens system of registration.","Answer: 3 Explanation: Option (3) is correct because originally, the word “fee” meant that the estate could be inherited, and the word “simple” meant that there was no qualification on the type of heir that could inherit. Option (1) is incorrect because a fee simple estate is a greater interest in land than a leasehold estate, which time-limited. Option (2) is incorrect because if the owner of the estate in fee simple does not dispose of a property by will, the owner’s heirs will inherit the estate in fee simple. Option (4) is incorrect because the concept of fee simple was created before the Torrens system of registration."
"Question 53: In British Columbia, there are three basic requirements for an easement. Which one of the following is a requirement? 
(1)The easement must be negative in nature. 
(2)The easement must accommodate the servient tenement. 
(3)The easement must be negative in nature. 
(4)The easement must be capable of forming the subject matter of a grant.","Answer: 4 Explanation: Option (4) is correct. The form the subject matter of a grant, the easement must be capable of reasonably exact definition, and the party who grants and whose land benefits from the easement must have the necessary capacity to be grantor and grantee. Option (1) is incorrect because an easement can be either positive or negative in nature (in comparison to a restrictive covenant, which must be negative in nature). Option (2) is incorrect because the easement must accommodate the dominant tenement, not the servient tenement. Option (3) is incorrect because one party can own both the dominant and servient tenement provided that they are two different parcels of land."
"Question 54: A pre-approved mortgage for a residential property: 
(1)will always guarantee the borrower’s interest rate for 365 days. 
(2)calculates the minimum loan that the borrower qualifies for. 
(3)will always guarantee the borrower’s interest rate for 365 days. 
(4)is based on a formula provided by the Fair Isaac Corporation.","Answer: 3 Explanation: Option (3) is correct because mortgage lenders may pre-approve a potential borrower for a mortgage based on his or her current financial situation and a satisfactory credit review. Options (1), (2) and (4) are incorrect."
"Question 55: Which appraisal approach/method would be MOST suitable to appraise a new pulp mill in Squamish? 
(1)Market comparison 
(2)Residual 
(3)Market comparison 
(4)Cost","Answer: 4 Explanation: Option (4) is correct because a pulp mill in Squamish is likely very unique without any comparable properties, so the cost approach must be used. Options (1), (2), and (3) are incorrect because these are likely inappropriate methods to appraise such a property, given its unique character."
"Question 56: The court will not normally grant the remedy of specific performance where: 
(1)the plaintiff is a limited company. 
(2)the defendant is without means. 
(3)the plaintiff is a limited company. 
(4)the contract has already been partially performed.","Answer: 3 Explanation: Option (3) is correct because the overriding principle of specific performance is that it will not be exercised when damages are an adequate remedy.

(1)Tim sold the car to Cherise for $1,750. 
(2)Before Cherise was willing to purchase the car, she insisted that she test drive the car and have it checked by the automobile association, which Tim allowed her to do. 
(3)Tim sold the car to Cherise for $1,750. 
(4)After advertising the bike for sale at $300 in vain, Tim sold the bike to Sandra, the only person to make an offer, for $260. Coralee accepted the money when she returned, although she was disappointed not to get the full price.","Answer: 2 Explanation: Option (2) is correct because the act of test driving the car and having it inspected is necessary in order to enable Tim to carry out the express authority and is incidental to that authority. It is therefore an example of implied authority. Option (1) is incorrect because it is an example of express authority. Option (3) and (4) are incorrect because they are examples of acts that Tim does not have actual or apparent authority to do. Therefore, authority cannot be implied for these acts."
"Question 58: In order to advertise to a wider audience, a licensee has decided to create his own website. Based on the information in the Knowledge Base Guidelines for Internet/Social Media Advertising, which of the following is a general guideline that the licensee should follow?

(2)He can advertise another licensee’s listings directly on his own website without permission from the listing brokerage in order to increase business. 
(3)The name of the brokerage can be excluded in online advertising. 
(4)If linking to an outside database of available properties, it should be clear to consumers which listings are his and which are not.","Answer: 4 Explanation: Option (4) is the correct answer because consumers should clearly be able to differentiate a licensee’s own listings from other available properties. Option (1) is incorrect because the name of the brokerage must appear in a prominent and easily readable form on all internet and social media advertising vehicles. Option (2) is incorrect because licensees should NOT advertise other licensees’ listings directly on their own website without the approval of the listing licensee. Option (3) is incorrect because if a licensee is a member of a team, the team name has to be included in social media advertising as well as on the licensee’s website."
"Question 59: Common property in a strata title development is: 
(1)owned equally by all members of the strata corporation. 
(2)owned by the strata corporation. 
(3)owned equally by all members of the strata corporation. 
(4)any property not designated as strata lots on a strata plan.","Answer: 4 Explanation: Option (4) is correct because section 1 of the Strata Property Act defines common property as any property not designated as strata lots on a strata plan. Options (1), (2), and (3) are incorrect because common property is owned by the members of the strata corporation, each in the proportion set out in the Schedule of Unit Entitlement."
"Question 60: Which of the following is/are included in the residential borrower qualification process? 
(1)Collecting information about the borrower and the property 
(2)Evaluating the applicants’ ability to meet the terms of a mortgage and the amount of their income 
(3)Collecting information about the borrower and the property 
(4)All of the above","Answer: 4 Explanation: Option (4) is the correct answer; Options (1), (2), and (3) are all included in the residential borrower qualification process. Lenders engage in many types of analysis to qualify a borrower to reduce the risk of lending."
"Question 61: Which of the following accurately summarizes the “requirement of writing” contained in section 59 of the Law and Equity Act? 
(1)A contract respecting land must be in writing or it is void. 
(2)A contract respecting land can never be enforced against a party who has not signed it. 
(3)A contract respecting land must be in writing or it is void. 
(4)None of the above three statements accurately summarizes the requirement of writing.","Answer: 4 Explanation: Option (4) is correct because none of the other statements accurately describe the requirement of writing. Option (1) is incorrect because an unwritten contract or disposition of land can be enforced against a party who has done or acquiesced in an act that indicates that contract or disposition has been made. It can also be enforced if the person alleging the contract or disposition has changed his position in reliance on such an act and it would be inequitable not to enforce the contract or disposition. Given this, Option (2) is also incorrect. Option (3) is incorrect because there is no requirement that a contract for the sale of land be contained in one written document."
"Question 62: Which of the following is TRUE? The “possession date” in a standard form contract of purchase and sale is: 
(1)the date on which adjustments are made between the parties for property taxes, etc. 
(2)the date on which the buyer takes vacant possession of the property, subject to any existing tenancy agreements. 
(3)the date on which adjustments are made between the parties for property taxes, etc. 
(4)the date on which the buyer must assume responsibility for risk of loss or damage to the property.","Answer: 2 Explanation: Option (2) is correct. Option (1) is false as the date on which adjustments are made between the parties for property taxes, interest, rent and other appropriate items is known as the adjustment date. Option (3) is false because the possession date is not always the same date as the completion date. Registration (performed on the completion date) takes some time to effect, so to set the possession date on the same date as the completion date may not be ideal. Option (4) is false because the buyer assumes responsibility for risk of loss or damage to the property on the completion date, when the buyer is registered on title at the Land Title Office."
"Question 63: The “term” of a mortgage ALWAYS: 
(1)necessitates the payment of an outstanding balance payment. 
(2)specifies the duration of the contractual relationship. 
(3)necessitates the payment of an outstanding balance payment. 
(4)is shorter than the amortization period.",Answer: 2 Explanation: Option (2) is correct because the term of a mortgage is the contractual period for which a borrower will make constant payments to the lender. Option (1) is incorrect because a partially amortized mortgage would not require payment of an outstanding balance at the end of the term. This is only required in the instance where a mortgage is fully amortized and the term length equals the amortization period. Option (3) is incorrect because incorrect because the term length of a partially amortized mortgage would be less than the amortization period. Option (4) is incorrect because the term length of a fully amortized mortgage would be equal to the amortization period.
"Question 64: Which of the following options BEST describes a building scheme? 
(1)It is a special example of a group of easements attaching to two or more lots in a development. 
(2)It is a set of restrictions on a development used to maintain uniformity. 
(3)It is a special example of a group of easements attaching to two or more lots in a development. 
(4)It is a document filed with the disclosure statement on a conversion of an existing building to a condominium.","Answer: 2 Explanation: Option (2) is correct because a building scheme is defined in the Land Title Act as a set of restrictive covenants imposed on two or more lots within a particular subdivision, generally used to maintain uniformity of the lots to protect their value. Option (1) is incorrect because building schemes are used to impose restrictions on all owners of the affected properties, while easements are granted to confer rights to the dominant tenement. Option (3) is incorrect because the restrictive covenants in a building scheme will disallow the buyer from building to their own tastes if these contravene the covenants. Option (4) is incorrect because a building scheme is registered by a Declaration of Creation of a Building Scheme which is separate from any required disclosure statement."
"Question 65: A mortgage broker is arranging a fully amortized mortgage loan with a face value of $240,000. The loan contract is to be written at 8% per annum, compounded semi-annually.

(1)The assignment from B to C must be for the entire amount. 
(2)The assignment from B to C must be in writing. 
(3)The assignment from B to C must be for the entire amount. 
(4)The notification from A to B must be in writing.","Answer: 4 Explanation: Option (4) is correct and Options (1), (2), and (3) are incorrect because the three requirements for a statutory assignment are that it is in writing, it is absolute and unconditional, and notice of the assignment is given to the original promissor."

"Question 69: In answer to the ringing of her doorbell, Kim opened the front door of her house to find a door-to-door vacuum salesperson on her doorstep. The salesperson walked into Kim’s house uninvited. Before Kim could stop him, he dumped some dirt onto her carpet for use in a demonstration of the vacuum cleaner he was selling. The dirt stained Kim’s carpet. Her lawyer correctly advises Kim that: 
(1)the salesperson may be liable in negligence for the damage he caused to the carpet. 
(2)the salesperson may be liable to Kim under British Columbia’s Occupiers Liability Act. 
(3)the salesperson may be liable in negligence for the damage he caused to the carpet. 
(4)she will probably succeed in a lawsuit based on the tort of private nuisance.","Answer: 1 Explanation: Option (1) is correct because the salesperson likely has a duty of care towards Kim when coming onto her property and demonstrating something to her. He may be found to have breached the standard of care by failing to take reasonable precautions not to damage her property. Option (2) is incorrect because the salesperson is not an occupier, and the Occupiers Liability Act deals only with liability to an occupier. Option (3) is incorrect because the fact that the salesperson is a trespasser does not bar Kim from recovering damages stemming from his conduct on her property. Option (4) is incorrect because the salesperson’s actions are more akin to trespass than private nuisance. The fact that the salesperson entered onto Kim’s land and placed something upon it and that it was an isolated occurrence point towards trespass rather than private nuisance."

(1)Product positioning 
(2)Product mapping 
(3)Product positioning 
(4)Product differentiation","Answer: 1 Explanation: Option (1) is correct because product positioning refers to the position a product or service holds within the minds of its consumers. Options (2), (3), and (4) are incorrect for this reason."
"Question 74: Using the cost approach of appraisal, what will be the market value of a property with a 50,000 square foot building if construction costs new are $48 per square foot, land value is $900,000, and total depreciation on the structure to date is estimated to be 10%? 
(1)$3,105,000 
(2)$3,060,000 
(3)$3,105,000 
(4)$3,300,000","Answer: 2 Explanation: Find the market value using the cost method of appraisal. Site Value: $900,000 + Cost of Improvements = $48  50,000 = $2,400,000  Depreciation $2,400,000  0.10 = $240,000 Market value = $900,000 + $2,400,000  $240,000 = $3,060,000"
"Question 75: Which of the following statements is TRUE when calculating income taxes payable for a corporation? 
(1)Depreciation expense cannot be treated as a deductible expense. 
(2)Capital cost allowance cannot be treated as a deductible expense. 
(3)Depreciation expense cannot be treated as a deductible expense. 
(4)It is necessary to know what the amount of declared dividends will be.","Answer: 1 Explanation: Option (1) is correct because depreciation expense cannot be deducted from taxable income. Instead, the Income Tax Act permits a capital cost allowance deduction from taxable income. Option (2) is therefore incorrect. Option (3) is incorrect because taxable income is used to calculate income taxes payable. Option (4) is incorrect because any declared dividends are important for taxation, as corporations receive special tax treatment for declaring and paying cash dividends."
"Question 76: Gheeta was out walking and saw a “For Sale” sign on the lawn of a house called Green Acres. She decided to ask the owners about the price of the property. Unknown to Gheeta, the owners of Green Acres were away on a long vacation in Jamaica. As Gheeta was walking across the lawn of Green Acres, a long branch from an old tree that grew in a neighbouring yard fell down and hit her. As a result, Gheeta broke her leg and could not return to work for two months. Which of the following statements is TRUE? 
(1)The owners of Green Acres will be held liable to Gheeta for her lost wages only if she can prove they knew of the hazard presented by the old tree. 
(2)The owners of Green Acres will not be held liable to Gheeta because they were not home at the time of the accident. 
(3)The owners of Green Acres will be held liable to Gheeta for her lost wages only if she can prove they knew of the hazard presented by the old tree. 
(4)The owners of Green Acres may be liable to Gheeta even though they were not home at the time of the accident.","Answer: 4 Explanation: Option (4) is correct because the owners of Green Acres, as “occupiers”, owe a duty to take reasonable care to ensure that persons entering their property will be reasonably safe. Despite being away on vacation, the owners of Green Acres are “occupiers” for the purposes of the Occupiers Liability Act because they maintain responsibility for, and control over, their property even while physically absent. Ensuring the safety of persons entering onto their property may have required the owners of Green Acres to take steps to address the hazard posed by the old, overhanging tree branch. If this is the case, the owners will be liable to Gheeta for her injury. Option (1) is incorrect because the risk of the tree hurting someone who comes onto the property only needs to be reasonably foreseeable, not known by the owners of Green Acres. Option (2) is incorrect because it is irrelevant whether the owners of Green Acres were home or not at the time of the injury. Option (3) is incorrect because Gheeta was injured on Green Acres and those who fall under the definition of an “occupier” of Green Acres under the Occupiers Liability Act, such as the owners of Green Acres, may also be liable to Gheeta for damages."
"Question 77: When a bidder’s ceiling price for a lot is $30,500 and the owner’s floor price is $32,500: 
(1)the parties could negotiate and produce a sale. 
(2)a sale cannot take place. 
(3)the parties could negotiate and produce a sale. 
(4)neither party is behaving reasonably.","Answer: 2 Explanation: Option (2) is correct because if a bidder’s ceiling price is $30,500, then this is the highest he will bid — he’s hit the ceiling. If an owner’s floor price is $32,500, then this is the lowest the owner will go. Therefore, a sale cannot take place because there is no price the bidder is willing pay that the owner will accept. Option (1) is incorrect because the ceiling and floor prices are the highest and lowest that the parties will go, respectively. A sale price cannot be negotiated outside of each party’s price range. Option (3) is incorrect for this reason. Option (4) is incorrect because there is no indication that the parties are behaving unreasonably."
"Question 78: Which one of the following is NOT a requirement to establish misrepresentation in contract law? 
(1)There must be an assertion of fact. 
(2)The assertion must be false. 
(3)There must be an assertion of fact. 
(4)The assertion must be in writing.","Answer: 4 Explanation: Option (4) is correct because a misrepresentation is not required to be in writing. Options (1), (2), and (3) are incorrect because the requirements to establish misrepresentation in contract law are that it must be an assertion of fact, it must be false, and it must have been material to the formation of the contract (i.e., it must have reasonably induced the other party to enter into the contract)."
"Question 79: Which of the following statements pertaining to SEO is TRUE? 
(1)SEO refers to how easily a website can be found in paid results on search engines. 
(2)A website that is incompatible with mobile devices may be penalized in search engine results that originate from mobile devices. 
(3)SEO refers to how easily a website can be found in paid results on search engines. 
(4)All of the above statements are true.","Answer: 2 Explanation: Option (2) is correct because a website that is not compatible with mobile devices may be penalized in search engine results that originate from mobile devices. Option (1) is incorrect because SEO refers to how easily a website can be found in unpaid (NOT paid) search results. Option (3) is incorrect because SEO stands for Search Engine Optimization. Since Options (1) and (3) are false, Option (4) is incorrect."
"Question 80: A life tenancy has been granted to Avon “without impeachment for waste”. For which of the following actions would Avon be liable? 
(1)Putting new shingles on the garage roof 
(2)Allowing the tool shed to deteriorate and collapse 
(3)Putting new shingles on the garage roof 
(4)Avon would not be liable in any of the above situations.","Answer: 4 Explanation: Option (4) is correct because Avon would not be liable in any of the previous scenarios. Option (1) is incorrect because it is an example of ameliorating waste. Avon is not liable for ameliorating waste because his life tenancy has been granted “without impeachment for waste.” Option (2) is also incorrect for this reason, as it is an example of permissive waste. Option (3) is incorrect because it is an example of voluntary waste."
"Question 81: The principle of substitution in the comparative approach of appraisal states that: 
(1)“market value” equals “value to owner”. 
(2)similar properties that have recently sold are comparable. 
(3)“market value” equals “value to owner”. 
(4)the market value of land plus the cost of a newly constructed building equals the market value of a property.","Answer: 2 Explanation: Option (2) is correct because the principal of substitution in the comparative approach of appraisal states that a property’s value should not exceed the cost of purchasing an alternate property that can provide similar utility. Therefore, similar properties that have recently sold are comparable. Option (1) is incorrect because the value to owner is highly subjective and likely differs from market value. Option (3) is incorrect because it is impossible to find identical properties; however, it is usually possible to find lots with enough common characteristics to regard them as similar for the purpose of appraisal. Option (4) is incorrect because it describes the cost approach, not the comparative approach of appraisal."
"Question 82: A strata lot in British Columbia in an exclusively residential complex is owned by two persons as joint tenants. At every meeting of the strata corporation, the owners are: 
(1)entitled to a total of one vote. 
(2)entitled to the number of votes that is calculated in proportion to their unit entitlement. 
(3)entitled to a total of one vote. 
(4)entitled to a total of one vote where the matter involves a special resolution, but individually entitled to one vote on all other matters.","Answer: 1 Explanation: Option (1) is correct because each strata lot gets one vote. If two or more persons share one vote because they own the strata lot together, only one of them may vote on a given matter. Option (2) is incorrect because votes are allocated one per strata lot, not by unit entitlement. Option (3) is incorrect because votes are allocated one per strata lot, not by individual owner. Option (4) is incorrect because the strata lot is entitled to one vote, regardless of the type of resolution being made."
"Question 83: Which of the following is NOT an example of a breach of contract? 
(1)Don contracted with Toni to buy his car. The night before Don was supposed to pay the price and take the car, the vehicle was struck by lightning in Toni’s driveway and destroyed. 
(2)After Babs contracted with Quin in May to rent his motorhome for one week in July, Quin telephoned Babs and told her that he was going to be using the home himself that week, and that she would not be able to rent it. 
(3)Don contracted with Toni to buy his car. The night before Don was supposed to pay the price and take the car, the vehicle was struck by lightning in Toni’s driveway and destroyed. 
(4)Adrian contracted to paint Woodie’s house starting on September 1 for a price of $500. On September 1, Adrian failed to appear and did not reply to any of the messages that Woodie left on Adrian’s answering machine.","Answer: 1 Explanation: Option (1) is correct because it is an example of frustration, rather than a breach of contract. Option (2) is incorrect because it is an example of a breach of contract. After the contract was agreed to, Quin did not fulfil his promise under the contract. Option (3) is incorrect because after the contract was agreed to, Fred did not fulfil his promise under the contract. Option (4) is incorrect because after the contract was agreed to, Adrian did not fulfil his promise under the contract."
"Question 84: Which one of the following would NOT be included in the operating expenses of a commercial property for purposes of determining its market value? 
(1)Reserve for replacement of equipment 
(2)Interest on the mortgage 
(3)Reserve for replacement of equipment 
(4)Advertising of vacant suites","Answer: 2 Explanation: Option (2) is correct because interest paid on a mortgage is not considered an operating expense. Options (1), (3), and (4) are incorrect because these are all included in operating expenses, which are paid by the landlord."
"Question 85: Diana leased an apartment from Horst for 12 months commencing January 1. On April 1, Horst conveyed the building to Bing. On April 15, Bing gave Diana a notice of end of the tenancy agreement effective May 15. The reason for the termination was that Bing wanted the apartment for his daughter, who had recently been married. Under the Residential Tenancy Act, what is the earliest date by which Bing can require Diana to leave? 
(1)May 31 
(2)May 15 
(3)May 31 
(4)June 30","Answer: 3 Explanation: Option (3) is correct because a fixed term tenancy cannot be terminated by the landlord before the end of the fixed term (i.e., December 31). The earliest that Bing can require Diana to leave is December 31, by serving Diana with a Two Month Notice to End Tenancy for Landlord’s Use of Property on October 31. Options (1), (2), and (4) are incorrect for this reason."
"Question 86: Which one of the following items is NOT likely to be available to an appraiser valuing a commercial property? 
(1)Current lease conditions at the time of sale of the property 
(2)The amount of any registered mortgages 
(3)Current lease conditions at the time of sale of the property 
(4)Physical characteristics of the building","Answer: 3 Explanation: Option (3) is correct because an appraiser will not be able to obtain the buyer’s expected rent and expense forecasts, as this is not publicly-accessible data. Options (1), (2), and (4) are incorrect because an appraiser valuing a commercial property can obtain documents, filings, and market data outlining things such as current lease conditions at the time of sale of the property, the amount of any registered mortgages, and the physical characteristics of the building."
"Question 87: A board of variance is: 
(1)a provincial board charged with the responsibility of seeing that actions by municipalities comply with the Local Government Act. 
(2)a board established by municipalities with the power to amend property assessments. 
(3)a provincial board charged with the responsibility of seeing that actions by municipalities comply with the Local Government Act. 
(4)a board established by municipalities to settle boundary line disputes between private parties.","Answer: 3 Explanation: Option (3) is correct because a board of variance is a local government board that determines whether a zoning bylaw creates undue hardships on property owners. It can grant a minor variance, provided it does not conflict with the local government’s policies. Option (1) is incorrect because a board of variance is not a provincial board. Option (2) is incorrect because a board of variance does not have the power to amend property assessments. Option (4) is incorrect because while a board of variance may grant minor variances to zoning bylaws, it does not settle property line disputes between private parties."
"Question 88: If Jeff applies for a mortgage loan with gross income of $3,000 per month, property taxes are estimated at $200 per month, and the lender’s permitted gross debt service ratio is 30%, what can Jeff afford to pay for monthly principal and interest? 
(1)$840

"Question 89: Which one of the following statements regarding appraisal is TRUE? 
(1)In order to appraise real property, one needs a minimum of a real estate trading services licence. 
(2)The complexity of real estate as a product requires the involvement of an expert appraiser. 
(3)In order to appraise real property, one needs a minimum of a real estate trading services licence. 
(4)Due to the low turnover of real estate, it is easy to collect information regarding recent transactions.","Answer: 2 Explanation: Option (2) is correct because real estate as a product is generally unique and complex, requiring expert skills and knowledge for an accurate appraisal. Option (1) is incorrect because no license is required to conduct an appraisal. Option (3) is incorrect because real estate is unique, and therefore cannot be classified as a homogenous commodity. Option (4) is incorrect because the low turnover of real estate makes it difficult to collect information regarding recent sales."
"Question 90: Mary and John own a piece of real property as joint tenants. Which of the following is FALSE? 
(1)Mary could sever the joint tenancy without John’s knowledge. 
(2)Mary and John each have an undivided interest in the property. 
(3)Mary could sever the joint tenancy without John’s knowledge. 
(4)Mary and John can have different interests in the property.","Answer: 4 Explanation: Option (4) is false and is therefore the correct answer. The unity of interest requires that all joint tenants have the same estate or interest in land; the extent, nature, and duration must be identical. Option (1) is incorrect in certain scenarios, a joint tenancy can be severed by one of the joint tenants even if the other joint tenant(s) is unaware of the action of the joint tenant severing the joint tenancy. Option (2) is incorrect because in a joint tenancy, the co-owners each have an undivided share in the property. By definition, joint tenants are co-owners of the same interest, whatever that interest may be. Finally, Option (3) is incorrect because a defining feature of joint tenancy is the right of survivorship. This means that when one joint tenant dies, that joint tenant’s estate automatically vests in the surviving joint tenant(s)."
"Question 91: Which of the following options is a disadvantage of using a central, gas-fired, forced air heating system? 
(1)A lack of air filtration 
(2)A slow response time to temperature changes 
(3)A lack of air filtration 
(4)Heat transmission is by radiation, which is ineffective","Answer: 3 Explanation: Option (3) is correct because central, gas-fired, forced air heating systems require ductwork under the floor, which makes it difficult and expensive to install after the house is already built. Options (1) and (2) are incorrect because these types of heating systems are advantageous in that they also provide air filtration and have a fast response time to temperature changes. Option (4) is incorrect because these types of heating systems transmit heat through convection."
"Question 92: Which of the following statements is TRUE? 
(1)A listing contract is not a specialized form of agency contract. 
(2)Under the Designated Agency system, while the brokerage contracts with the seller or buyer, an individual licensee is appointed to act as the sole agent of that seller or buyer. 
(3)A listing contract is not a specialized form of agency contract. 
(4)An agent’s authority to bind their principal depends entirely on the express authority given by the principal, and not upon implied, usual, or customary authority.","Answer: 2 Explanation: Option (2) is correct because it is true. Option (1) is false because a listing contract is a specialized form of agency contract. It is a contract between the seller and a real estate brokerage. The brokerage promises to try to find a buyer and the seller promises to pay a stated amount of commission if the brokerage is successful. Option (2) is true. Designated Agency eliminates the conflict that previously arose when two licensees in the same brokerage represented both the seller and the buyer in a transaction. Option (3) is false because real estate brokerages can work on behalf of a seller or a buyer on a real estate transaction. Option (4) is false because an agent’s authority to bind his or her principal can arise: (1) expressly; (2) by implication; (3) as a result of the doctrine of estoppel; or, (4) by ratification by the principal of the agent’s acts done on the principal’s behalf."
"Question 93: An amendment to a contract of purchase and sale: 
(1)is generally not legally binding on the seller and buyer until finalized in writing and signed by all parties to the original contract. 
(2)must be signed by at least the seller and selling licensee who negotiated the original contract. 
(3)is generally not legally binding on the seller and buyer until finalized in writing and signed by all parties to the original contract. 
(4)can be made only before a buyer’s offer is accepted by a seller.","Answer: 1 Explanation: Option (1) is correct and Option (2) is incorrect because under section 59 of the Law and Equity Act, a contract for the sale of land must generally be in writing and signed by all parties to the contract. Option (3) is incorrect because an amendment to a contract of purchase and sale will state that it does not terminate the existing contract. Option (4) is incorrect because if a change is made to the contract of purchase and sale before the buyer’s offer is accepted, then there is no contract of purchase and sale. It is simply an amendment to the offer (i.e., a counter-offer)."
"Question 94: A mortgage contract with a face value of $175,000 requires monthly payments of $1,103.21 over a 20-year amortization period. However, the mortgage broker advances only $171,000 after deducting a commission of $2,500, legal fees of $1,000, and an appraisal fee of $500. Calculate the cost of funds advanced for the borrower, expressed as an effective annual rate (j1). 
(1)4.730370% 
(2)4.777233% 
(3)4.730370% 
(4)4.834288%","Answer: 4 Explanation: Option 4 is correct. $175,000 is the face value, the amount that the contract is written for. However, there are legal fees, commissions, and appraisal fees that are deducted; therefore, the actual amount that is applied to the loan is $171,000 (present value).

"Question 95: The transfer by the borrower of the equity of redemption to a subsequent buyer does not always relieve the borrower of the covenant to repay the debt. However, there are circumstances where the borrower may be relieved of liability on the personal covenant. Which one of the following events would NOT relieve the borrower from this liability? 
(1)The borrower has received a release from the lender. 
(2)The borrower has sold the property with the knowledge of the lender. 
(3)The borrower has received a release from the lender. 
(4)The original contract between the lender and the vendor is replaced by a new contract between a lender and the purchaser.","Answer: 2 Explanation: Option (2) is correct because the lender’s knowledge that the property has been sold will not relieve the borrower from liability on his or her personal covenant. Options (1), (3), and (4) are incorrect because these events will relieve the borrower from this liability."
"Question 96: Veronica has agreed to sell her home to Patty for $75,900. The completion and adjustment date is set at November 14. Veronica paid the current year’s property taxes on the date they were due in the amount of $896. It is NOT a leap year. Patty’s share of the year’s property taxes will appear on the seller’s statement of adjustments as a: 
(1)debit of $115.38. 
(2)credit of $115.38. 
(3)debit of $115.38. 
(4)credit of $117.83.","Answer: 4 Explanation: Option (4) is correct because when taxes are previously paid by the seller, the buyer should reimburse the seller for the portion of the year from the adjustment date onward. The reimbursement will appear as a credit on the seller’s statement and a debit on the buyer’s statement. Patty’s share of the year’s property taxes (Nov. 14 B Dec. 31 = 48 days) is calculated in the following manner: 48/365 × $896 = $117.83. Options (1), (2), and (3) are therefore incorrect."
"Question 97: Vince has agreed to sell his home to Pedro for $75,900. To assist in the purchase, Pedro is borrowing $65,000 from his uncle as a first mortgage loan. Pedro’s loan from his uncle will appear: 
(1)as a debit on Pedro’s statement and a credit on Vince’s statement. 
(2)as a credit on Pedro’s statement and a debit on Vince’s statement. 
(3)as a debit on Pedro’s statement and a credit on Vince’s statement. 
(4)only on Vince’s statement.","Answer: 3 Explanation: Option (3) is correct because when a new loan is received by the buyer from a mortgage company or third party, the amount appears only as a credit on the buyer’s statement of adjustments, as a new loan does not affect the seller’s cash proceeds of sale. The $65,000 loan will only appear on Pedro’s statement, as a credit. Options (1), (2), and (4) are therefore incorrect."
"Question 98: Victor has agreed to sell his home to Pamela for $75,900. The completion and adjustment date is set at November 14. The real estate commission payable by Victor is 7% of the selling price. Pamela has made a deposit of $2,000, which the real estate brokerage has passed to Pamela’s lawyer to be deposited in a trust account until the completion date. Victor has agreed to accept Pamela’s diamond ring as part payment equal to $7,500. Pamela is borrowing $65,000 from the Bank of Dad as a first mortgage loan. Victor paid the current year’s property taxes on the date they were due in the amount of $896. Pamela’s lawyer will charge $600 to cover both legal and registration fees. Victor will be paying out a judgment registered against the title to his house in the amount of $6,225 and the legal fee to remove it will be $85. Victor is relying on Pamela’s lawyer to handle this transaction for him. As no exemptions apply to this transaction, property transfer tax will be payable upon completion. It is NOT a leap year. As well, Pamela is NOT a foreign entity for property transfer tax purposes. The balance due to complete required from Pamela is:

"Question 99: Valerie has agreed to sell her home to Phil for $75,900. The real estate commission payable by Valerie is 7% of the selling price. The real estate commission will appear:

(3)as a debit on Phil’s statement and a credit on Valerie’s statement.

"Question 100: A fee simple owner in British Columbia who is the victim of a fraudulent conveyance of their land will lose the right to have the transfer set aside when: 
(1)the transfer of the property to the dishonest person has been registered in the land title office. 
(2)the title to the property has been transferred to a good faith purchaser for valuable consideration. 
(3)the transfer of the property to the dishonest person has been registered in the land title office. 
(4)they notify the registrar of land titles that fraud has occurred.","Answer: 2 Explanation: Option (2) is correct and Options (1), (3), and (4) are incorrect because the only way a victim of a fraudulent conveyance of his or her land will lose the right to have the transfer set aside is when the title to the property has been transferred to a good faith purchaser for valuable consideration."
"Question 101: The flow of information concerning real property is limited and difficult to collect because: 
(1)the turnover rate for real property is high. 
(2)every parcel of real property is homogeneous. 
(3)the turnover rate for real property is high. 
(4)real property markets are local, with real estate fixed in location.","Answer: 4 Explanation: Option (4) is correct because it is true. Option (1) is incorrect because the turnover rate for real property is low, meaning there are limited data sources and information available upon which to base an opinion of an value. Option (2) is incorrect because every parcel of real property is distinct, unique, and heterogenous, meaning property values cannot be easily standardized or generalized. Option (3) is incorrect because real property is durable and long-lasting, meaning it may not be quick to respond to market pressures."
"Question 102: In Canada, the power to make laws is divided between the federal and provincial levels of government. Which of the following has NOT been assigned to the federal government? 
(1)Jurisdiction over harbours 
(2)Jurisdiction over matters affecting private property and the power to delegate some provincial authority to a third level of government 
(3)Jurisdiction over harbours 
(4)Jurisdiction over the regulations to protect fisheries","Answer: 2 Explanation: Option (2) is correct because these powers have been assigned to the provincial government under the Constitution Act, 1867.

"Question 103: Which one of the following is NOT a course of action that the British Columbia Financial Services Authority can take following a disciplinary hearing? 
(1)Reprimand the licensee 
(2)Order the cancellation of the licensee’s licence 
(3)Reprimand the licensee 
(4)Order the licensee to enroll in and complete a course of studies or training","Answer: 3 Explanation: Option (3) is correct because the British Columbia Financial Services Authority (“BCFSA”) cannot suspend the licensee from participation in the Multiple Listing Service (MLS) following a disciplinary hearing.

(1)The crossing of another person’s property by mistake 
(2)The deliberate crossing of another person’s property 
(3)The crossing of another person’s property by mistake 
(4)All of the above","Answer: 4 Explanation: Option (4) is correct because all of the options are examples of trespass. Trespass consists of wrongfully entering, remaining on, or placing something on another’s land. Trespass requires both a voluntary and a direct action. Option (1) is an example of trespass because even though entering the other property was a mistake, it was still intentional since the person had control over where they were walking. Option (2) is an example of trespass because deliberately crossing another person’s property is both voluntary and direct. Option (3) is an example of trespass because even though the person did not personally step on another person’s land, they intentionally threw the item. The item ended up on the other person’s property as a result of the direct act of the trespasser."

"Question 121: After a borrower has given a mortgage of real property, the borrower’s remaining interest is described at law as: 
(1)a right of foreclosure. 
(2)a common law mortgage. 
(3)a right of foreclosure. 
(4)an equitable mortgage.","Answer: 3 Explanation: Option (3) is correct because a mortgagor (i.e., a borrower) who grants a mortgage of real property to a lender retains an interest described as “the equity of redemption”. The equity of redemption protects the borrower’s right to redeem the property upon payment of the mortgage. Option (1) is incorrect because a right of foreclosure arises in favour of a lender where the borrower defaults on the mortgage. Option (2) is incorrect because a mortgage at common law was a conveyance of both title to land and the possession of the land to a lender, not a right retained by the borrower. Option (4) is incorrect because an equitable mortgage refers to a mortgage which is not (and perhaps cannot be) registered on title as a legal mortgage."

(4)still deemed a legal mortgage.","Answer: 2 Explanation: Option (2) is correct because a mortgage that is granted, but for procedural reasons is not registrable, is recognized as an equitable mortgage. Option (1) is ncorrect because this type of mortgage is an equitable mortgage, and is enforceable. Option (3) is incorrect because while a lender should file a caveat to protect its position until the mortgage is in proper registrable form and registered on title, a caveat is not the only protection for an equitable mortgage. An equitable mortgage can also be protected by handing over to the lender the duplicate certificate of title as security for the loan. Option (4) is incorrect because this is an equitable mortgage, not a legal mortgage."

The loan has an amortization period of 25 years, a term of 5 years, and calls for monthly payments rounded up to the next higher dollar.

(4)A notice of the cost to the property owner of a local improvement project",Answer: 3 Explanation: Option (3) is correct because an assessment notice is a notice informing a property owner of the value of the property as of July 1 of the previous year. Option (1) is incorrect because a separate statement called a “tax notice” is sent to property owners requesting payment of taxes.

(3)An appraiser cannot rely on the client to identify and resolve the problem even though the client is requesting the report. 
(4)The appraiser need not know the report’s intended use since the client is the one paying for the report and would know its purpose.",Answer: 4 Explanation: Option (4) is correct because it is false. The appraiser must understand the client’s intended use in order to make the appropriate scope of work decision. Option (1) is incorrect because appraisers do not rely on the client; they use their experience and judgment to establish the information necessary to identify and resolve the problem. Option (2) is incorrect because the appraiser determines the scope of work and level of information necessary to produce a credible appraisal. Option (3) is incorrect because limited detail may be acceptable if it falls within the requested scope of work and limitations are indicated in the report.

The subject property is not adjusted to the comparables nor are the comparables adjusted to each other. Option (1) is incorrect because the correct approach is to determine which comparable is most like the subject property and use that as main evidence for the final market value, not to average the value of the comparable sale prices. Option (2) is incorrect because the comparable properties need not have the same lot size as the subject property.

(3)A strata plan is a plan contained in the disclosure statement filed with the superintendent that shows the developer's goals for the development. 
(4)A strata plan is only necessary when creating five or more strata lots.","Answer: 2 Explanation: Option (2) is correct because an owner developer creates a strata development by filing a strata plan with the land title office. On the strata plan, the entirety of the building is divided between strata lots and common property. Option (1) is incorrect because a strata plan does not contain the developer’s goals nor does it form part of the disclosure statement. Option (3) is incorrect because cooperative owners possess shares in a non-profit corporation, which in turn holds title to the land. Therefore, there is no need to file a strata plan to divide the property into individual units. Option (4) is incorrect because a strata plan must be filed for any strata development regardless of the number of lots being created."
"Question 136: A lender who is foreclosing may ask the court to appoint a receiver where the property being foreclosed is: 
(1)a large residential apartment building. 
(2)a single-family dwelling with a tenant occupying it. 
(3)a large residential apartment building. 
(4)any one of the above.","Answer: 4 Explanation: Option (4) is correct because Options (1), (2), and (3) all describe situations in which a lender who is foreclosing may ask the court to appoint a receiver. If a mortgaged property has been abandoned (as described in Option (3)) or contains a commercial operation (as described in Options (1) and (2)), the lender may request that the court appoint a receiver to collect the rents, pay the bills, and generally keep the business going."

(2)amounts to a trespass. 
(3)endangers the safety or comfort of the public or some major section of the public. 
(4)causes physical damage to the person’s own property.","Answer: 3 Explanation: Option (3) is correct because a private nuisance occurs when an owner or occupier of land unreasonably and substantially interferes with the reasonable use and enjoyment of a neighbouring property. Option (1) is incorrect because private nuisance is concerned with the use and enjoyment of property, not the safety or comfort of the public at large. Option (2) is incorrect because an act constituting private nuisance need not involve a trespass (e.g., the wrongful disturbance of an easement may constitute a private nuisance). Option (4) is incorrect because Option (3) is correct."
"Question 139: In British Columbia, before approving a conversion of a rental building to a condominium, the approving authority must consider a number of factors. Which one of the following is NOT a mandatory consideration? 
(1)The priority of rental accommodation over private ownership in the area 
(2)The proposal to relocate existing tenants 
(3)The priority of rental accommodation over private ownership in the area 
(4)The potential increase in real property tax revenue","Answer: 4 Explanation: Option (4) is correct because it is not mandatory to consider the potential increase in real property tax revenue to convert a rental building to a condominium. Options (1), (2), and (3) are all factors the approving authority must consider when deciding whether to approve the conversion."
"Question 140: Which one of the following does NOT result from the immobility of land? 
(1)The need for debt financing 
(2)A vulnerability to outside environmental factors 
(3)The need for debt financing 
(4)The necessity for owners to travel in order to take advantage of services provided by different parcels of land","Answer: 1 Explanation: Option (1) is correct because the immobility of land does not affect how a purchase is financed.

(1)Log 
(2)Concrete block 
(3)Log 
(4)Post, beam, and plank","Answer: 3 Explanation: Option (3) is correct because a vaulted ceiling is an architectural variation, not a structural method used in housing construction.

"Question 142: On a straight line principal reduction loan, the monthly payment: 
(1)is a constant amount each month. 
(2)pays interest only. 
(3)is a constant amount each month. 
(4)declines over time.","Answer: 4 Explanation: Option (4) is correct because the monthly payment on a straight line principal reduction loan declines over time. Options (2) and (3) are incorrect because each monthly payment includes a constant amount of the principal, plus the interest that has accrued for the month. Options (1) is incorrect because as the outstanding balance declines over time, the amount of monthly interest declines; therefore, the total payment declines."

"Question 147: A local mortgage broker arranged a mortgage in the amount of $210,000. The borrower has agreed to pay a brokerage fee in the amount of $7,200 that is to be added to the loan amount, giving a face value of $217,200 for the loan. The mortgage bears interest at a contract rate of 4.5% per annum, compounded semi-annually. The mortgage has an amortization period and term of 20 years and calls for monthly payments.

(1)Former decisions are used as a basis for later decisions. 
(2)The common law system has uniformity. 
(3)Former decisions are used as a basis for later decisions. 
(4)All of the above result from the doctrine of stare decisis.","Answer: 4 Explanation: Option (4) is correct because the age of the decision does not determine which decision should govern the subsequent decision.

"Question 149: Which of the following statements regarding the income approach of appraisal is TRUE? 
(1)Net operating income is a measure of return on the equity portion of a property’s value. 
(2)Items specific to an owner or investor are included in the calculation of net operating income. 
(3)Net operating income is a measure of return on the equity portion of a property’s value. 
(4)The income approach is only used for apartment buildings.","Answer: 3 Explanation: Option (3) is correct because it is true. Option (1) is incorrect because the net operating income represents a return on the entire value of the property; it is not a return only on the equity portion of the property’s value. Option (2) is incorrect because items specific to an owner or investor are NOT included in the calculation of net operating income. Option (4) is incorrect because the income approach can be used in appraising most types of property, although it is more appropriate for properties that produce rental income, e.g., apartment buildings, office buildings, industrial space."
"Question 150: Karen’s neighbour, Jack, is a gas barbecue enthusiast who cooks two meals a day, seven days a week, on his outdoor gas barbecue. As a result, the smoke and fumes are carried onto Karen’s property. The barbecue smoke has discoloured Karen’s dining room curtains and killed her shrubs. Which of the following statements is TRUE? 
(1)Jack may be liable to Karen for private nuisance and Karen may seek an injunction to prevent Jack from continuing the nuisance. 
(2)If Karen chooses to sue Jack for negligence, she must prove that he has breached the duty of care owed to her by a reasonable person in Jack’s situation. 
(3)Jack may be liable to Karen for private nuisance and Karen may seek an injunction to prevent Jack from continuing the nuisance. 
(4)Karen need not prove that she has suffered any form of damage to succeed in her lawsuit against Jack because her cause of action is considered trespass and “actionable per se” (i.e., without proof of damage).","Answer: 1 Explanation: Option (1) is correct. Karen may have a claim for private nuisance against Jack, as the interference was continuous, the act was done on his land but affected Karen’s land, and it interfered with Karen’s use and enjoyment of her land. An injunction is a possible remedy available under a successful action in private nuisance. Option (2) is false because, if Karen chooses to sue Jack for negligence, she must prove that he has breached the standard of care owed to her by a reasonable person in Jack’s situation, not that he breached the duty of care. Option (3) is false because the interference with airspace rights of a fee simple owner would likely be an action in trespass, and in this case, Jack did not trespass, as the act was done on his land. Option (4) is false because although trespass is actionable per se, Jack did not trespass onto Karen’s property. Trespass requires the direct physical invasion of land by a person or tangible object."
"Question 151: Which of the following is NOT a duty that is owed by a principal to their agent? 
(1)The duty to indemnify the agent 
(2)The duty to remunerate the agent 
(3)The duty to indemnify the agent 
(4)The duty to avoid conflicts of interest with the agent","Answer: 4 Explanation: Option (4) is correct because the agent has a duty to avoid conflicts of interest with his or her principal, but the principal does not owe this duty to his or her agent.

"Question 152: Which one of the following occupiers of real property would NOT be liable, by statute, for the real property taxes? 
(1)The registered owner of a life estate 
(2)The registered holder of a long-term lease, where the lessor is not a tax exempt organization or a public body 
(3)The registered owner of a life estate 
(4)The registered holder of an agreement for sale","Answer: 2 Explanation: Option (2) is correct because in British Columbia the statutory liability to pay real property taxes is on the owner of the property. This applies even in the context of long term-leases where the lessor is not a tax exempt organization or public body. That said, a lease contract can impose on a lessor a contractual liability to pay property taxes. Option (1), (3), and (4) are incorrect because each of these entities would be statutorily liable for property taxes."
"Question 153: Larry and Theresa orally agree that Theresa will lease 10 acres of farmland owned by Larry for 5 years. As part of the agreement Larry agrees to build a barn, which he does at a cost, to him, of $10,000. Which one of the following statements is TRUE? 
(1)The lease agreement is not enforceable by Larry because it is neither in writing nor signed by Theresa as is required by section 59 of the Law and Equity Act. 
(2)Section 59 of the Law and Equity Act does not apply to lease agreements. 
(3)The lease agreement is not enforceable by Larry because it is neither in writing nor signed by Theresa as is required by section 59 of the Law and Equity Act. 
(4)The lease agreement is void because it is not in writing.","Answer: 3 Explanation: Option (3) is correct because Larry may be able to enforce the lease agreement under section 59 of the Law and Equity Act since he has spent $10,000 on a new barn. Generally, contracts respecting land in British Columbia must be in writing to be enforceable, pursuant to section 59 of the Law and Equity Act. However, section 59 allows an exception to this writing requirement in situations where the person seeking to enforce an unwritten contract has changed his or her position such that it would be unfair not to enforce the contract. Option (1) is incorrect because there are exceptions to the writing requirement imposed by section 59. Option (2) is incorrect because section 59 applies to lease agreements for more than 3 years. Option (4) is incorrect because a lease agreement is not automatically void if not in writing (e.g., section 59 does not apply to lease agreements for terms of 3 years or less)."
"Question 154: Which of the following statements is FALSE under the common law of agency? 
(1)An agency relationship is created when two persons agree that one will act on behalf of the other. 
(2)Where the agent does not disclose that they are an agent and enters into a contract with a third party, the principal can have no liability for the contract. 
(3)An agency relationship is created when two persons agree that one will act on behalf of the other. 
(4)An agency agreement may be either written or oral or partly written and partly oral.","Answer: 2 Explanation: Option (2) is correct because a principal will be bound to a third party by the acts of their agent provided those acts were within the agent’s authority. This means that a principal could be liable to a third party under a contract entered into by their agent where the agent failed to disclose their status as an agent, as long as the agent was acting within their authority. That said, where an agent does not disclose to a third party that he or she is acting as an agent, the agent may also be held liable as a principal. Options (1), (3), and (4) are incorrect because each statement is true of the common law of agency."
"Question 155: There are many reasons why a property might sell for a price that is different from its current appraised value. Which of the following could be a reason?

(2)The property is located beside a fertilizer plant. 
(3)The property is in a state of long-term disrepair. 
(4)The property is located next to a school.","Answer: 3 Explanation: Option (3) is the correct answer as the cost approach is most likely to result in an appraisal value that is significantly different from the price a property might sell for. The reason for this is because the replacement cost of a property may not be representative of the value in the market. Options (1), (2), and (4) are incorrect because these factors would likely be accounted for in the appraised value."

(1)the brokerage lists two or more properties for the same seller. 
(2)the seller lists the property with two or more brokerages. 
(3)the brokerage lists two or more properties for the same seller. 
(4)the contract requires the listing to be distributed to all members of the real estate board.","Answer: 4 Explanation: Option (4) is correct because a multiple listing agreement is a type of exclusive listing contract which requires that the listing be distributed to all members of the listing licensee’s real estate board. Option (1) is incorrect because the term “multiple” in “multiple listing agreement” does not refer to the number of properties the brokerage lists for the same seller. Options (2) and (3) are incorrect because a multiple listing contract is always an exclusive right to sell, meaning that the property is listed with only one brokerage and the seller pays one commission to that brokerage."
"Question 159: The practice of recognizing expenses as they are incurred, rather than when they are paid for, is a characteristic of which generally accepted accounting principle? 
(1)The cost principle 
(2)The recognition principle 
(3)The cost principle 
(4)The conservation principle","Answer: 3 Explanation: Option (3) is correct because the matching principle states that expenses must be recorded when they are incurred, not when they are paid. Option (1) is incorrect because the cost principle states that assets must be recorded for the purchase price on the date of acquisition. Option (2) is incorrect because the recognition principle is not an accounting principle, although the revenue recognition principle states that revenues must be recorded when they are earned, not when money is received. Option (4) is incorrect because the conservation principle is not a generally accepted accounting principle."
"Question 160: By extending the amortization period of a loan: 
(1)the mortgage loan is paid off faster, which reduces the amount of interest paid by the borrower. 
(2)the size of the required payment will be larger. 
(3)the mortgage loan is paid off faster, which reduces the amount of interest paid by the borrower. 
(4)the repayment of principal is spread over a greater number of payments, making each payment smaller.","Answer: 4 Explanation: Option (4) is incorrect because a longer amortization period will mean that repayment is spread out over a longer period of time, and payments will be smaller. Options (1) is incorrect for this reason. Option (2) is incorrect because the size of the required payment will be smaller. Option (3) is incorrect because extending the loan amortization period does not affect its classification."

(3)Digital signatures are used to authenticate the individual sending the message so as to ensure the integrity of the data. 
(4)Digital signatures are tags in HTML that tell search engines information about a webpage.","Answer: 1 Explanation: Option (1) is correct because digital signatures are codes that are used to authenticate the individual sending the message so as to ensure the integrity of the data.

(3)It would appear as a credit on the buyer’s statement and as a debit on the seller’s statement. 
(4)The commission only appears on the buyer’s statement.","Answer: 3 Explanation: Option (3) is correct because the commission is paid by the seller only.

(2)the existing property should undergo renovation for continued similar use. 
(3)higher value may result through a change of use. 
(4)it should not be offered for sale.","Answer: 1 Explanation: Option (1) is correct because a property possesses latent value if its current state does not represent its highest and best use. Given this, the latent value of the property may be realized through a change of use. Option (2) is incorrect because a renovation for continued similar use would not realize the property’s latent value.

(4)A component of a septic waste water system","Answer: 1 Explanation: Option (1) is correct because a dormer is a roof extension that provides extra floor area and windows for the upper level of a home. Options (2), (3), and (4) are incorrect for this reason."
"Question 169: The fact that a joint tenant’s interest does not pass to a personal representative on death is referred to as: 
(1)an estate in inheritance. 
(2)a tenancy in common. 
(3)an estate in inheritance. 
(4)a life estate.","Answer: 3 Explanation: Option (3) is correct and Options (1), (2), and (4) are incorrect because the right of survivorship means that when one joint tenant dies, the entire estate automatically vests in the surviving joint tenants."
"Question 170: Meika Jones is being sued for creating a nuisance. Which of the following arguments is a valid defence to the lawsuit? 
(1)The activity involved benefits the public. 
(2)She has not been negligent in carrying out the activity. 
(3)The activity involved benefits the public. 
(4)The activity is authorized by statute but could be carried out without creating a nuisance.",Answer: 3 Explanation: Option (3) is correct because an unreasonable and substantial interference with property is required to establish a claim in nuisance. Trifling and inconsequential damages is insufficient. Option (1) is incorrect because it is no defence to say that the act complained of is beneficial to the public. Option (2) is incorrect because the fact that the activity creating the nuisance has not been performed in a negligent way is no defence to an action in nuisance. Option (4) is incorrect because the mere fact that the activity is authorized by statute does not mean the activity is not a nuisance.

(1)987654321 
(2)R$2c 
(3)987654321 
(4)reale$tate","Answer: 3 Explanation: Option (3) is correct: this password is longer than 8 characters, includes a variety of character types, is not a dictionary word (or combination of dictionary words), and does not include a combination of consecutive keyboard keys. Option (1) is incorrect because it is a sequence of consecutive keyboard combinations. Option (2) incorrect because it is too short. Option (4) is incorrect because it is a combination of dictionary words with an obvious symbol to replace a letter, which can easily be cracked."
"Question 173: Prepayment in a mortgage refers to: 
(1)the right of lenders to demand full repayment of the outstanding principal if the payments fall into arrears. 
(2)the right of the borrower to pay off all (or some) of the outstanding balance during the term of the mortgage. 
(3)the right of lenders to demand full repayment of the outstanding principal if the payments fall into arrears. 
(4)the payment of a finder’s fee to a mortgage broker (as compensation for arranging a mortgage loan), which is made prior to the advancing of mortgage funds.","Answer: 2 Explanation: Option (2) is correct because individual borrowers have the right, under the terms of the Interest Act, to prepay all of the outstanding debt (with additional three months’ interest as a penalty in lieu of notice) at any time after five years from the initiation date of the mortgage. In some instances, mortgage contracts allow for partial or complete prepayment to occur at any point in the contractual term. Options (1), (3), and (4) are incorrect because they do not describe prepayment in a mortgage."
"Question 174: For which one of the following properties would an appraiser be MOST justified in employing the cost approach to determine market value? 
(1)A 40-year-old bungalow that represents the highest and best use 
(2)A newly-constructed church of contemporary design 
(3)A 40-year-old bungalow that represents the highest and best use 
(4)A high rise office tower located in an outer suburb","Answer: 2 Explanation: Option (2) is correct. An appraiser who is asked to find the market value of a newly-constructed church would not be able to use the comparative or investment approaches due to the lack of data and would be justified in relying upon the cost approach. In addition, the appraiser can effectively determine the cost of constructing the improvements since the church is newly constructed and has not experienced any depreciation. Option (1) is incorrect because a 40-year old bungalow should be appraised using the direct comparison approach, Option (3) is incorrect because a vacant lot with latent value should be appraised using the residual method. Option (4) is incorrect because a high rise office tower in an outer suburb should be appraised using the income approach."
"Question 175: Which of the following statements regarding profits à prendre is TRUE? 
(1)A profit à prendre must accompany a dominant tenement. 
(2)The right to fish on another’s land is an example of a profit à prendre. 
(3)A profit à prendre must accompany a dominant tenement. 
(4)An owner who wishes to impose restrictions consistent with a general scheme of development would likely charge the land with a profit à prendre.","Answer: 2 Explanation: Option (2) is correct because a profit à prendre is a right to enter onto the land of another person and to take some profit from the land, such as profits from fishing. Options (1) and (3) are incorrect because unlike easements, profits à prendre need not accompany a dominant tenement. They also need not be granted for an indefinite period of time. Option (4) is incorrect because an owner who wishes to impose restrictions consistent with a general scheme of development would likely charge the land with a building scheme."
"Question 176: A commercial “periodic” tenancy is: 
(1)a term lease. 
(2)a lease for a certain period of time. 
(3)a term lease. 
(4)a tenancy that is created in a commercial context after the entering of the lease and prior to the entering of possession by the tenant.","Answer: 3 Explanation: Option (3) is correct because a periodic tenancy automatically renews itself on the last day of the term for a further term of the same duration until terminated by either party. Options (1), (2), and (4) are incorrect because these statements do not describe features of periodic tenancies."
"Question 177: Victor is selling his house to Paula with an adjustment date and a possession date of August 16, and a completion date of August 14. He is concerned about the fact that he just filled his oil tank. Which one of the following is TRUE? 
(1)The conveyancer will give Victor a debit on the statement of adjustments for the oil in the tank. 
(2)Victor will lose the cost of his oil. He should not have filled the tank. 
(3)The conveyancer will give Victor a debit on the statement of adjustments for the oil in the tank. 
(4)The cost of oil remaining in the tank must be calculated as at the completion date and Paula must reimburse Victor for that amount.","Answer: 3 Explanation: Option (3) is correct because oil left in the storage tank is an item usually settled between the parties outside of the statements of adjustments. Options (1), (2), and (4) are incorrect for the same reason."
"Question 178: Lenders who are attempting to ration mortgage funds could: 
(1)decrease their gross debt service ratio. 
(2)decrease their interest rate on mortgage loans. 
(3)decrease their gross debt service ratio. 
(4)increase the maximum amortization period available on mortgage loans.","Answer: 1 Explanation: Option (1) is correct because rationing mortgage funds means to reduce the amount given out to mortgage loans. By reducing the gross debt service ratio (PIT/Gross Income), the lender decreases the amount of the loan for a given gross income. Option (2) is incorrect because decreasing their interest rates doesn’t decrease the amount lent out; it just creates a greater demand for loans. Option (3) is incorrect because increasing the maximum loan to-value ratio means for a given market value of the property, the lender is willing to advance a greater amount of a loan. Option (4) is incorrect because increasing the maximum amortization period, all other factors constant, means the present value of the loans will decrease, since borrowers are given more time to pay off the loan."
"Question 179: With fully amortized constant payment mortgages, when payments are rounded up to the next higher cent, the final payment necessary to repay the loan amount will be: 
(1)smaller than the regular payments. 
(2)larger than the regular payments. 
(3)smaller than the regular payments. 
(4)impossible to determine.","Answer: 1 Explanation: Option (1) is correct because if the payment is rounded up to the next higher cent, the final payment of a fully amortized mortgage will be smaller than regular payments, because the borrower is “overpaying” a slight amount each period. Options (2), (3), and (4) are incorrect for this reason."
"Question 180: A brokerage must maintain at least one account in a bank, trust company, or credit union designated as a trust account into which the brokerage must put, upon receipt, all monies received for or on behalf of a client. The Real Estate Services Act only permits the brokerage to withdraw money from such an account under certain circumstances. Which one of the following is NOT one of them? 
(1)Money paid to or in accordance with the instructions of the principal to whose credit the money was deposited 
(2)Money intended as remuneration for a licensee and that has been earned in accordance with the Rules 
(3)Money paid to or in accordance with the instructions of the principal to whose credit the money was deposited 
(4)Money required for payment of a brokerage’s business expenses","Answer: 4 Explanation: Option (4) is correct because a brokerage is not permitted to withdraw money from the trust account to pay business expenses. Options (1), (2), and (3) are incorrect because the Real Estate Services Act allows a brokerage to withdraw money from the trust account in those circumstances."
"Question 181: You have a partially completed appraisal report that you need to fill in. The 2,600 square foot subject property has 4 bathrooms. The house next door is similar in all respects except for the number of bathrooms and square footage. It sold for $234,000 and was adjusted +$5,700 for bathrooms and –$10,000 for square footage. If the market value of a bathroom is $5,700 and above a 1,900 sq. ft. benchmark, each 100 sq. ft. is worth $5,000, it can be concluded that this comparable has: 
(1)3 bathrooms and 2,800 square feet. 
(2)5 bathrooms and 2,400 square feet. 
(3)3 bathrooms and 2,800 square feet. 
(4)3 bathrooms and 2,600 square feet.","Answer: 1 Explanation: Option (1) is correct because in relation to the subject property, this comparable has three bathrooms (one less bathroom) and 2,800 square feet. The square footage adjustment is -$10,000; therefore, since the square footage adjustment is $5,000 per 100 square feet, there is a 200 square foot difference between the comparable and the subject. Since the adjustment is negative, the comparable property is larger (by 200 square feet) than the subject (2,600 + 200). Options (2), (3), and (4) are therefore incorrect."
"Question 182: An option to purchase the mortgaged property given by the borrower to the lender at the time the mortgage is negotiated is: 
(1)enforceable if the borrower has independent legal advice. 
(2)void. 
(3)enforceable if the borrower has independent legal advice. 
(4)a collateral advantage.","Answer: 2 Explanation: Option (2) is correct and Options (1), (3), and (4) are incorrect because an option to purchase the property provided by the borrower to the lender is considered a clog on the equity of redemption, and is void."
"Question 183: A mortgage contract with a face value of $170,000 requires monthly payments of $1,117.12 over a 20-year period. However, the mortgage broker advances only $166,000 after deducting a commission of $2,500, legal fees of $1,000, and an appraisal fee of $500.

"Question 184: After an order nisi of foreclosure is granted to a petitioner and the respondent borrower fails to pay the amount due as required by the order, the petitioner may apply for: 
(1)an order absolute of foreclosure. 
(2)a judicial sale. 
(3)an order absolute of foreclosure. 
(4)either (1) or (2).",Answer: 4 Explanation: Option (4) is correct because the petitioner may apply for either an absolute of foreclosure or a judicial sale after an order nisi is granted and the respondent borrower fails to pay the amount due as required by the order. Options (1) and (2) are incorrect for the same reason. Option (3) is incorrect because an equitable charging order is not an option for petitioners to apply for after the respondent borrower fails to pay the amount due as required by an order nisi.
"Question 185: Which one of the following is NOT a rationale for government regulation of land use? 
(1)Protection of property values 
(2)Public health and safety 
(3)Protection of property values 
(4)Conservation of natural resources","Answer: 3 Explanation: Option (3) is correct because limiting the power of land developers is not a rationale for government regulation of land use. Options (1), (2), and (4) are correct because they are all rationales for government regulation of land use."
"Question 186: What will be the maximum loan granted on a commercial building with a lending value of $3,500,000 and yielding a net operating income of $360,000 per year, where the lender requires a debt coverage ratio of 1.25 and an 80% loan-to-value ratio? The loan will be amortized over 20 years with annual payments and the interest rate is 7.5% per annum, compounded annually. Round your answer to the nearest $1,000. 
(1)$2,936,000 
(2)$2,800,000 
(3)$2,936,000 
(4)$2,590,000","Answer: 2 Explanation: The maximum loan granted will be the lower amount of the loan-to-value constraint and the DCR constraint. Using DCR constraint, calculate maximum allowable payments."
"Question 187: Which one of the following statements is correct? 
(1)Contracts of purchase and sale can always be assigned. 
(2)Contracts of purchase and sale can never be assigned. 
(3)Contracts of purchase and sale can always be assigned. 
(4)Contracts of purchase and sale can be assigned if the contract includes the standard assignment terms, the assignment does not prejudice the seller, and the contract does not prohibit assignment.","Answer: 4 Explanation: Option (4) is correct because section 8.2 of the Real Estate Services Act requires licensees to include the standard assignment terms in the contract of purchase and sale (unless they have been advised otherwise by their client). If the requirements of section 8.2 are met, assignments are permissible provided that they do not prejudice the rights of the seller and the contract does not prohibit assignment. Option (1) is incorrect because contracts of purchase and sale can only be assigned if certain conditions are met. Option (2) is incorrect because contracts of purchase and sale can be assigned in some circumstances. Option (3) is incorrect because under the standard assignment terms, contracts of purchase and sale can be assigned with the written consent of the seller, not the buyer."
"Question 188: With respect to an insured mortgage loan, which one of the following statements is FALSE? 
(1)Default insurance is paid for by the borrower. 
(2)The borrower can add the premium to the mortgage amount. 
(3)Default insurance is paid for by the borrower. 
(4)The lender has only the personal covenant of the borrower and the value of the property for security.","Answer: 4 Explanation: Option (4) is correct because it is false. With an insured mortgage loan, the lender has not only the borrower’s personal covenant, but also the insurance as fallback security in the case the borrower defaults on payments. Options (1), (2), and (3) are true statements and are therefore incorrect."
"Question 189: A seller is willing to sell his house, by way of a take-back mortgage, for $90,000.

"Question 190: A person whom an agent represents is known in law as the: 
(1)buyer. 
(2)principal. 
(3)buyer. 
(4)seller.","Answer: 2 Explanation: Option (2) is correct because the principal is the person for whom an agent has contracted to act for, and for whose benefit the agent is required to perform and make decisions. Options (1) and (4) are incorrect because while an agent may represent a buyer or seller, the question is asking for the general term for the person that an agent represents, regardless of the side of the transaction. Option (3) is incorrect because “client” is not the legal term for the person whom an agent represents."
"Question 191: In applying the income approach, depreciation is excluded from operating expenses in the calculation of net operating income. Which one of the following statements is an explanation for why depreciation is excluded? 
(1)Depreciation measures a loss in value that occurs despite regular repairs and maintenance. 
(2)Depreciation affects only the building component of the property. 
(3)Depreciation measures a loss in value that occurs despite regular repairs and maintenance. 
(4)The life of a building is primarily determined by economic factors rather than physical condition.","Answer: 4 Explanation: Option (4) is correct because depreciation is excluded in net operating income calculations because the life of a building depends on its economic durability, not its physical durability. The economic life of many buildings is so long that the amount of depreciation taken each year is not an important element in the estimation of value. Option (1), (2), and (3) are incorrect because they do not describe reasons for excluding depreciation from net operating income."
"Question 192: If a property owner considers that the actual value assessment of their property is too high, they must first submit their complaint to: 
(1)a Property Assessment Review Panel. 
(2)the Board of Variance. 
(3)a Property Assessment Review Panel. 
(4)the Property Assessment Appeal Board.","Answer: 1 Explanation: Option (1) is the correct answer. A Property Assessment Review Panel is the first level of appeal from a property assessment. Option (2) is incorrect because the Board of Variance deals with exceptions to zoning bylaws. Option (3) is incorrect because the Municipal Finance Authority levies property tax, but does not deal with assessments. Option (4) is incorrect because the Property Assessment Appeal Board is the second level of appeal (i.e., it hears appeals from the Property Assessment Review Panel)."
"Question 193: Which one of the following is NOT essential in order to constitute a restrictive covenant in law? 
(1)It must be positive in nature. 
(2)It must be negative in nature. 
(3)It must be positive in nature. 
(4)The burden of the restriction must have been intended by the parties to bind the land.","Answer: 1 Explanation: Option (1) is correct because a restrictive covenant must be negative, not positive. Options (2), (3), and (4) are incorrect because being negative in nature, involving two parcels of property and having intention to bind the land are all essential elements of a restrictive covenant."
"Question 194: If payments are rounded up to the next higher dollar, the MOST likely result is: 
(1)an increase in the cost to the borrower. 
(2)a higher yield to the lender. 
(3)an increase in the cost to the borrower. 
(4)an increase in the number of payments.","Answer: 3 Explanation: Option (3) is correct because if payments are rounded up to the next higher dollar, the final payment will likely be smaller because the borrower is “overpaying” a small amount each period. Options (1) and (2) are incorrect because rounding will not increase the cost to the borrower or the yield to the lender. Option (4) is incorrect because the number of payments will remain the same."
"Question 195: There are two ways to surrender a lease under a commercial tenancy. One is by an act of the parties; the other is: 
(1)by operation of law. 
(2)by the order of an arbitrator. 
(3)by operation of law. 
(4)by an order of the Residential Tenancy Board.","Answer: 1 Explanation: Option (1) is correct because surrender of a commercial lease can arise by operation of law where the landlord does some act which is inconsistent with the continuation of the tenancy. Options (2), (3), and (4) are incorrect because an arbitrator, Public Trustee and the Residential Tenancy Board cannot grant orders amounting to surrender of a commercial lease."
"Question 196: A potential buyer is aware of the asking price for a particular house listed for sale. Which of the following statements is normally FALSE? 
(1)The probable sale price will be equal to or above the floor price. 
(2)The probable sale price will be equal to or above the seller’s “value to owner”. 
(3)The probable sale price will be equal to or above the floor price. 
(4)The seller is likely to know the buyer’s ceiling price.","Answer: 4 Explanation: Option (4) is the false statement as it is unlikely that the seller knows the buyer’s ceiling price. Options (1), (2), and (3) are all true statements."

"Question 198: At the end of a profitable year, a business’s ownership has decided to leave all these profits in the business. Which one of the following BEST describes the effect that profitable operations have on the balance sheet of a business? 
(1)Owner’s equity is increased 
(2)Assets are increased 
(3)Owner’s equity is increased 
(4)Liabilities are decreased","Answer: 1 Explanation: Option (1) is correct because When a company generates a profit (positive net income), the result is an increase in the owner’s or shareholder’s equity. Option (2) is incorrect because assets may increase or decrease depending on the company’s cash flow and asset purchase/sale activity. Option (3) is incorrect because cash may increase or decrease depending on the company’s cash flow activities. Option (4) is incorrect because liabilities may increase or decrease depending on the company’s borrowing and repayment activities."
"Question 199: John makes the following offer to Mary. “I will pay you $500 to put a new rose bed in my garden.” If Mary accepts, what is the result? 
(1)There is no contract because there is no consideration. 
(2)The promise to pay is past consideration and therefore no contract exists. 
(3)There is no contract because there is no consideration. 
(4)There is no contract because the contract is not in writing.","Answer: 3 Explanation: Option (3) is correct because assuming John and Mary intend to enter into a legal relationship, the other essentials of a contract are met – offer, acceptance, and consideration. There is no evidence that one of the parties lacks capacity or is lacking genuine consent. Option (1) is incorrect because $500 is valid consideration. Option (2) is incorrect because the promise to pay is future consideration, not past, as Mary does not yet have the money. Option (4) is incorrect because the contract is not required to be in writing."
"Question 200: Under the Environmental Management Act, a mortgage lender may be liable for the remediation of a contaminated site if the lender: 
(1)participates only in purely financial matters related to the site. 
(2)insists on environmental conditions within a security agreement. 
(3)participates only in purely financial matters related to the site. 
(4)appoints a person to inspect a contaminated site to determine future actions to take.","Answer: 3 Explanation: Option (3) is correct because a mortgage lender may attract liability for remediation of a contaminated site if they become the registered owner of the property, for example, as the result of foreclosure. Options (1), (2), and (4) are incorrect because the Environmental Management Act specifically provides that a lender is not liable if they participate only in financial matters, impose requirements that will not cause or increase contamination, or appoint a person to investigate the site."
"Question 201: When a contract is executed under seal, the seal: 
(1)constitutes a written acceptance. 
(2)takes the place of the signature of the offeror and offeree. 
(3)constitutes a written acceptance. 
(4)represents intention.","Answer: 3 Explanation: Option (3) is correct because if a contract is executed under seal, the contract will be binding even if no consideration has been given. Option (1) is incorrect because the contract must also be accepted. Option (2) is incorrect because the contract may still need to be signed. Option (4) is incorrect because the seal itself does not show intention, as it is possible that the parties may not know of the legal effects of a seal."
"Question 202: Two identical houses located next to one another in the same neighbourhood sell within one week of each other. Ms. Brown sells hers for $112,000, while Mr. Fisher is only able to sell his for $100,000. Which of the following could account for the difference in selling price? 
(1)The listing brokerage representing Ms. Brown spent an extraordinary amount of money on advertising her property. 
(2)Mr. Fisher supplied a vendor take-back mortgage at 9% while the current market rates were 12%. 
(3)The listing brokerage representing Ms. Brown spent an extraordinary amount of money on advertising her property. 
(4)All of the above factors could account for the difference in selling price.",Answer: 1 Explanation: Option (1) is correct because increased advertising on a particular property will result in more potential buyers that may result in a higher sale price. Option (2) is incorrect because Mr. Fisher is providing beneficial below-market financing that should increase the value of the property and mortgage for sale. Option (3) is incorrect because Ms. Brown’s motivation to sell her home quickly would be more likely to result in a quick sale for a lower price. Option (4) is incorrect because Options (2) and (3) are incorrect.
"Question 203: Which financial institution is currently the largest single source of institutional mortgage funds in Canada? 
(1)Credit unions 
(2)Life insurance companies 
(3)Credit unions

"Question 205: A voidable contract is:

(2)a contract that one or both of the parties can cancel. 
(3)one that never existed at all, even if the parties want it to exist. 
(4)the result of a void deed.","Answer: 2 Explanation: Option (2) is correct because a voidable contract is one which one of the parties has the option to rescind (meaning cancel) the contract. Option (1) is incorrect because this definition describes a void contract. Option (3) is incorrect because a voidable contract can still be enforceable. If the party with the option to cancel chooses not to cancel the contract, they can enforce it against the other party. Option (4) is incorrect because a deed is a document used to transfer an interest in land, not a contract."

(2)A joint tenancy with all of the other strata lot owners 
(3)A fee simple interest only

Option (1) is incorrect because neither legal nor equitable charges are guaranteed by the principle of indefeasibility. Option (2) is incorrect because the principle of indefeasibility only provides that a good-faith purchaser can rely completely on the ownership shown on the certificate of title, and can acquire good title upon registration, even though there are defects in the vendor’s registered title.

"Question 217: Kent rented his Kerrisdale house to Lisa for a fixed term of three years commencing July 1, 2008 and terminating on June 30, 2011 for an annual rent of $12,000 payable in equal monthly instalments on the first day of each month. On April 12, 2010, Lisa abandoned the premises without giving notice to Kent and without paying the rent for April. The BC Residential Tenancy Act requires Kent to do which of the following? 
(1)Hire a bailiff to distrain Lisa’s goods left on the premises to compensate Kent for the rent in arrears 
(2)Limit his claim against Lisa for arrears of rent to the amount of the security deposit provided by her 
(3)Hire a bailiff to distrain Lisa’s goods left on the premises to compensate Kent for the rent in arrears 
(4)Sue Lisa for the rent due for the remaining term of the lease without any obligation for Kent to account to Lisa for the security deposit and accrued interest","Answer: 3 Explanation: Option (3) is correct because section 7(2) of the Residential Tenancy Act imposes a duty on residential landlords to mitigate their damages that results from the tenant’s breach of the tenancy agreement. For example, if a tenant wrongfully vacates the premises prior to the expiry of a fixed term residential tenancy agreement (as occurred with Lisa in this question), the landlord must still attempt to re-rent the premises at a reasonably economic rent. Option (1) is incorrect because section 26(3) of the Residential Tenancy Act effectively abolishes the remedy of distress in residential tenancies. Option (2) is incorrect because the Residential Tenancy Act does not limit claims for arrears of rent. The amount claimed for arrears of rent is only limited by the duty to mitigate damages required of the landlord. Option (4) is incorrect because the Residential Tenancy Act does not require the landlord to sue the tenant."

(3)Must have a minimum of three references from currently licensed managing or associate brokers

(3)If the seller has already paid the current year’s taxes, the seller must be given a credit of the taxes from the adjustment date to December 31. 
(4)All of the above are correct.","Answer: 1 Explanation: Option (1) is correct because the seller has already paid all of the taxes for the current year and needs to be refunded the amount proportional to the time that the seller is no longer living in the property. Option (2) is incorrect because the seller is responsible for the full amount of any penalty. It is not adjusted because only the seller is liable to pay the taxes and failed to do so in a timely manner.

"Question 242: In a particular real estate transaction, taxes for the current year, in the amount of $516, were paid by the seller on July 1. The adjustment, possession, and completion date is July 28. Where would the tax adjustment appear on the statements of adjustments? 
(1)As a credit on the buyer’s statement and a debit on the seller’s statement 
(2)As a credit on the seller’s statement and a debit on the buyer’s statement 
(3)As a credit on the buyer’s statement and a debit on the seller’s statement 
(4)As a debit on both statements","Answer: 2 Explanation: Option (2) is correct because when taxes are previously paid by the seller, the buyer should reimburse the seller for the portion of the year from the adjustment date onward. The reimbursement will appear as a credit on the seller’s statement and a debit on the buyer’s statement. Options (1), (3), and (4) are incorrect for this reason."
"Question 243: A property is sold for $175,000. Real estate commission is 5% on the first $100,000 and 2.5% on the balance of the sale price. The adjustment, possession, and completion date is July 28. Taxes for the current year, in the amount of $516, were paid by the seller on July 1. The buyer has paid a $20,000 deposit to her brokerage. The legal fees for the conveyance amount to $384. No exemptions apply to this transaction, so property transfer tax is payable upon completion. It is NOT a leap year. As well, the buyer is NOT a foreign entity for property transfer tax purposes. The required balance due to complete from the buyer will be:

(1)$221.95 
(2)$294.05 
(3)$221.95 
(4)$282.45","Answer: 1 Explanation: Option (1) is correct because when taxes are previously paid by the seller, the buyer should reimburse the seller for the portion of the year from the adjustment date onward. The buyer’s share of the year’s property taxes (Jul. 28 to Dec. 31 = 157 days) is calculated in the following manner: 157/365 × $516 = $221.95. This amount will appear as a credit on the seller’s statement and a debit on the buyer’s statement of adjustments. Options (2), (3), and (4) are therefore incorrect."

"Question 246: Which of the following statements is TRUE regarding professional ethics? 
(1)Professional ethics standards are the same as the legal requirements for a licensee. 
(2)Licensees have a professional duty to hold other licensees to the highest professional and ethical standards. 
(3)Professional ethics standards are the same as the legal requirements for a licensee. 
(4)Professional ethics only apply to the relationship between a licensee and their client.","Answer: 2 Explanation: Option (2) is correct because licensees have a duty to maintain the integrity of the real estate profession, including holding others in the profession to the highest standards. Option (1) is incorrect because ethical standards are not the same as the legal requirements for a licensee. Professional ethics standards are often higher standards compared to legislative standards. Option (3) is incorrect because the duties of full disclosure, confidentiality, acting in accordance with lawful instruction, and acting in a client’s best interests are all duties under the Rules and fiduciary duties. Option (4) is incorrect because professional ethics apply when dealing with clients, non-clients, and other real estate professionals."
"Question 247: You have a partially completed appraisal report that you need to fill in. The 2,000 square foot subject property has 4 bathrooms. The house next door is similar in all respects except for the number of bathrooms and square footage. The 2,100 square foot comparable sold for $326,500 and has 3 bathrooms. If the market value of a bathroom is $2,700 and above an 1,800 sq. ft. benchmark, each 100 sq. ft. is worth $5,000, this comparable will have to be adjusted for bathrooms and square footage by: 
(1)–$2,700 and +$5,000 respectively. 
(2)+$5,000 and –$2,700 respectively. 
(3)–$2,700 and +$5,000 respectively. 
(4)+$5,400 and +$2,700 respectively.","Answer: 3 Explanation: Option (3) is correct because the comparable will need an adjustment of +$2,700 for 1 bathroom since the subject has one more bathroom than the comparable. In addition, there is a - $5,000 adjustment for the 100 square foot difference in size because the subject is smaller than the comparable. Options (1), (2), and (4) are therefore incorrect."
"Question 248: In the shopping behaviour model, which of the following is NOT a main classification? 
(1)Specialty goods 
(2)Superior goods 
(3)Specialty goods 
(4)Convenience goods","Answer: 2 Explanation: Option (2) is correct because the shopping behaviour model classifies products and services based on the amount of effort that a consumer is willing to go through to obtain that product or service. There is no superior goods classification. Options (1), (3), and (4) are incorrect because this classification system includes convenience goods, shopping goods, specialty goods, and unsought goods."

"Question 251: Any clause contained in a mortgage that clogs the equity of redemption is: 
(1)valid. 
(2)void. 
(3)valid. 
(4)an unreasonable restraint of trade.","Answer: 2 Explanation: Option (2) is correct because of an implied term required in mortgage law that, upon full repayment of the loan, a borrower has the right to have title reconveyed to him or her in the same state as it was at the time of the making of the mortgage (usually this means title will be free and clear of all encumbrances). Any term which seeks to provide otherwise is considered to be a “clog on the equity of redemption” and will be of no effect, or void. Option (1) is incorrect because any term which is void cannot be valid. Option (3) is incorrect because a term which purports to clog the equity of redemption is not considered to be illegal; rather, it will simply not be enforced by the courts. Option (4) is incorrect because it confuses a clog on the equity of redemption with a stipulation for a collateral advantage. Problems related to collateral advantages are no longer considered a clog on the equity of redemption and are instead debated in terms of unreasonable restraints of trade."
"Question 252: In which of the following situations would bridge financing be the MOST advantageous form of financing for Jonathan? 
(1)Jonathan and his wife recently had a second child and are looking to purchase a larger home. Jonathan and his wife have found the perfect home in North Vancouver but their current home has not yet sold, and they need money for a down payment. 
(2)Jonathan is a first time home buyer looking to buy a townhouse near Burnaby. 
(3)Jonathan and his wife recently had a second child and are looking to purchase a larger home. Jonathan and his wife have found the perfect home in North Vancouver but their current home has not yet sold, and they need money for a down payment. 
(4)Jonathan’s children have moved out of the house and Jonathan wants to downsize to a smaller home that he can finance completely from his savings.","Answer: 1 Explanation: Option (1) is correct because bridge financing is a type of interim financing whereby a borrower will receive a loan and grant a mortgage to a lender for a short period while long-term financing is being pursued. Bridge financing can be used where a borrower has purchased property but has not sold his or her existing property and financing to purchase the new property is required. Option (2) is incorrect as a conventional mortgage would be the most effective financing option for Jonathan in this situation. Option (3) is incorrect as a reverse annuity mortgage would best allow Jonathan to access the equity in his home to make a purchase. Option (4) is incorrect as it would not require any financing, since Jonathan wants to pay completely from his savings."
"Question 253: In applying the cost approach to the valuation of a single-family residence built in 1954, the value of improvements is determined by: 
(1)the actual construction costs, or if unavailable, historic construction cost data. 
(2)the current costs of constructing a modern equivalent of the subject property. 
(3)the actual construction costs, or if unavailable, historic construction cost data. 
(4)the construction costs for a builder of average efficiency measured in 1954 standards.","Answer: 2 Explanation: Option (2) is correct because when using the cost approach of appraisal, cost of the improvements is normally determined by utilizing the current replacement cost. Replacement cost is the cost of providing a building that would represent the modern equivalent of the house to be appraised in determining the construction cost of a building. Options (1), (3), and (4) are incorrect for this reason."
"Question 254: Consider a building for which a strata plan was filed in August of 2011. In the event that the building is destroyed and the strata corporation passes a resolution not to rebuild, how will the proceeds of any insurance policy be distributed? 
(1)Equally between all owners 
(2)According to the unit entitlement of the individual strata lot owners 
(3)Equally between all owners 
(4)According to a conversion schedule based upon the most recent assessed values of the strata lots","Answer: 4 Explanation: Option (4) is correct because the Strata Property Act applies to strata plans deposited on or after July 1, 2000, replacing the Schedule of Interest on Destruction which was used under previous legislation. Section 273 and 278 of the Act provide for a “conversion schedule” or “interest schedule” that will be employed to determine the distribution of the proceeds in the event that a strata complex is destroyed and the owners decide to take the insurance money instead of rebuilding. Option (1) is incorrect because the value of each strata lot is different and therefore it would be unfair to distribute insurance policy proceeds equally between all owners. Options (2) and (3) are incorrect because they are based on unit entitlement, which is similar to the Schedule of Interest on Destruction, which is only used for strata plans deposited prior to July 1, 2000."
"Question 255: Under which one of the following conditions is the comparative approach of appraisal MOST applicable? 
(1)Where the volume of sales transactions is very low 
(2)Where buyers and sellers are well informed about current sales transactions 
(3)Where the volume of sales transactions is very low 
(4)Where the property is unique","Answer: 2 Explanation: Option (2) is correct because the comparative approach of appraisal is most appropriate where buyers and sellers are well informed about current sales transactions. Options (1) and (3) are incorrect because the comparative approach of appraisal is applicable when there is sufficient recent sales data of similar properties, and the property does not have redevelopment potential. Option (4) is incorrect because under the comparative approach, a property’s value should not exceed the cost of purchasing an alternative property that can provide similar utility. Therefore, it may not be appropriate if a property is unique."
"Question 256: In a scenario where a licensee is directly or indirectly acquiring an interest in real estate and has complied strictly with the disclosure requirements of the Real Estate Services Rules, which of the following statements is TRUE? 
(1)No conflict of interest and duty could exist. 
(2)The common law may still require further disclosure. 
(3)No conflict of interest and duty could exist. 
(4)They are safe from any sort of liability arising from that purchase.","Answer: 2 Explanation: Option (2) is correct because, although the Real Estate Services Act outlines certain disclosure requirements in Section 5-10, the common law considers an agent’s duties and responsibilities to the principal to be one of a fiduciary nature and requires a duty of loyalty, which includes both confidentiality and FULL disclosure, above and beyond what is required in Section 5-10. Options (1) and (4) are incorrect because the common law may extend a licensee’s disclosure responsibilities beyond the duty to disclose laid out in Section 5-10. Option (3) is incorrect because making a secret profit would violate the duty of utmost loyalty and full disclosure."
"Question 257: Whose responsibility is it under the Assessment Act to establish actual value? 
(1)The local municipal council 
(2)The British Columbia Financial Services Authority 
(3)The local municipal council 
(4)The Assessor","Answer: 4 Explanation: Option (4) is correct because the assessor’s primary purpose under the Assessment Act is to provide actual values on which to apply tax levies. Option (1) is incorrect because the municipal council sets the general tax rate for each class of property in a given territory, but does not determine the actual value of the property. Option (2) is incorrect because the British Columbia Financial Services Authority does not establish actual value of property. Option (3) is incorrect because the Lieutenant-Governor in Council appoints the Property Assessment Appeal board, but is not involved in assessing the actual value of a piece of property."
"Question 258: Which of the following is NOT a characteristic of a mortgage as an investment? 
(1)Illiquid relative to government bonds 
(2)Requires a high degree of administrative work 
(3)Illiquid relative to government bonds 
(4)Has short repayment terms and amortization periods","Answer: 4 Explanation: Option (4) is the correct answer as a mortgage typically has long terms and amortization periods. Option (1) is incorrect because mortgages do not trade publicly such as bonds and stocks, making them relatively illiquid. Options (2) and (3) are incorrect because mortgage loans also require a high degree of administrative work, and a relatively high initial outlay of capital compared to other investments."
"Question 259: Where two neighbouring landowners contract to prevent one of them from putting their land to a certain use, they are said to have created: 
(1)a licence. 
(2)a limiting caveat. 
(3)a licence. 
(4)an easement.","Answer: 3 Explanation: Option (3) is correct because a restrictive covenant is an interest in land which imposes a restriction on the use of one person’s land (the servient tenement) for the benefit of another piece of land (the dominant tenement). Option (1) is incorrect because a licence creates a positive right, not a restriction. Option (2) is incorrect because a caveat is a notice registered against the title to land warning those searching the registrar that someone is claiming an estate or interest in land against the title. Option (4) is incorrect because an easement gives the holder a positive right to use the neighbouring land for his benefit, whereas a restrictive covenant prevents the neighbouring land from being used in a particular way."
"Question 260: Which of the following is a valid mandatory component of the strata plan that a developer must deposit at the land title office to create a strata development? 
(1)Drawings that show the designated street address of each strata lot 
(2)A Schedule of Unit Entitlement 
(3)Drawings that show the designated street address of each strata lot 
(4)The area of each strata lot indicated in square feet","Answer: 2 Explanation: Option (2) is correct because every strata plan must include a Schedule of Unit Entitlement. Option (1) is incorrect because the required drawings must show the strata lots distinguished by number or letter in consecutive order, but they are not necessarily required to show the street address of each strata lot. Option (3) is incorrect because there are no Standard Rules provided in legislation, and there is no requirement for a strata corporation to create Rules. Rather, there is only a requirement for there to be bylaws in place when the strata plan is filed. Option (4) is incorrect because the area of each strata lot must be indicated in square metres, not square feet."
"Question 261: Which one of the following is the BEST reason for an investor to choose to use debt financing rather than all cash in order to purchase an income-producing property? 
(1)The investor can deduct from taxable income the principal portion of debt repayments, thus lowering taxes payable. 
(2)A one-year term on the debt financing required is readily available. 
(3)The investor can deduct from taxable income the principal portion of debt repayments, thus lowering taxes payable. 
(4)Property values are expected to decrease.","Answer: 3 Explanation: Option (3) is correct because an investor can typically procure debt financing at a rate lower than the expected yield on investment. This allows the investor to cover the debt payments with the revenue generated from the investment. Option (1) is incorrect because only the interest portion of mortgage payments are tax deductible. Option (2) is incorrect as most terms are typically longer than one term, and this provides no advantage to the investment. Option (4) is incorrect as the change in property values has no influence on the investor’s choice of debt or equity financing."
"Question 262: Shaylena is the listing agent for Dave’s property. The property has a large tree in the backyard, which Dave told Shaylena he will be removing before the property is sold. Dave has a busy week at work and has asked Shaylena not to present any offers to him until the week is over. Shaylena shows the property to Kiyoko, who says that the large tree will make a perfect spot for a tire swing. Shaylena does not mention that the tree will be removed. Kiyoko makes a full-price offer on the property, but Shaylena delays telling Dave about the offer until the week is over. What professional duty has Shaylena breached? 
(1)The duty to act honestly 
(2)The duty to communicate all offers in a timely manner 
(3)The duty to act honestly 
(4)Shaylena has not breached any professional duties.","Answer: 1 Explanation: Option (1) is correct because licensees must act honestly with non-clients, which includes being truthful about the property and the fact that Dave intends to remove the tree before the property is sold. Option (2) is incorrect because an exception to the duty to communicate all offers to the client is if a client specifically instructs their licensee not to communicate offers to them promptly. Option (3) is incorrect because Shaylena has not been asked to give advice outside of her area of expertise. Option (4) is incorrect because Shaylena has breached the duties to act honestly and to act with reasonable care and skill."
"Question 263: Bob and Margaret execute a contract under seal. Which of the following is TRUE? 
(1)Because of the seal, there is no need for written acceptance. 
(2)Because of the seal, neither party needs to sign the contract. 
(3)Because of the seal, there is no need for written acceptance. 
(4)Because of the seal, there is no need for consideration.","Answer: 4 Explanation: Option (4) is correct because a contract made without consideration can still be enforceable if it is made under seal. However, all other elements of a valid contract must still be present. Options (1) and (2) are incorrect because executing a contract under seal does not remove the requirement under section 59 of the Law and Equity Act that, in most cases, contracts affecting land must be in writing and signed in order to be enforceable in court. Option (3) is incorrect because the parties must have intended to create legal obligations in order for a contract to be formed, whether or not it is executed under seal."
"Question 264: Which of the following statements is TRUE? 
(1)The total of the debit column on the seller’s statement must be identical to the total of the credit column on the buyer’s statement. 
(2)The practice is to hold the seller responsible for the taxes on the adjustment date itself. 
(3)The total of the debit column on the seller’s statement must be identical to the total of the credit column on the buyer’s statement. 
(4)The adjustment date and the possession date must be the same day.","Answer: 3 Explanation: Option (3) is correct because on the completion date the seller is obligated to transfer title and the buyer is obligated to pay the purchase price in accordance with the contract for purchase and sale. Option (1) is incorrect because the statements of adjustment of the buyer and seller are treated separately and are not comprised of identical information. Option (2) is incorrect because, although the amount of taxes for the year are apportioned between the parties as of the adjustment date, the party “held responsible” for their share of the taxes will depend on whether the property taxes for the year have been paid already by the seller or will be due in the future to be paid by the buyer. Option (4) is incorrect because, although the adjustment and possession dates are most often the same, they are not required to be so. The adjustment date may coincide with either the completion or possession date or fall in between the two."
"Question 265: Which of the following statements is TRUE regarding GST in a transaction for the sale of real estate? 
(1)GST generally does not apply to the amount of the deposit until the closing date. 
(2)GST will always apply to reimbursements for prepayments. 
(3)GST generally does not apply to the amount of the deposit until the closing date. 
(4)All amounts found on the statements of adjustments are subject to GST.","Answer: 1 Explanation: Option (1) is correct because payment of the deposit is generally not subject to GST until closing occurs, at which time the full amount of the sale price (including the deposit) becomes taxable. Option (2) is incorrect because no GST applies to reimbursements for prepayments. Option (3) is incorrect because under section 165(1) of the Excise Tax Act, the buyer (the “recipient”) has the obligation to pay the GST. Option (4) is incorrect because only amounts on the statements of adjustments that are legally components of the purchase price are subject to GST."
"Question 266: S, a seller, offers to sell a property to A for $50,000. The offer is to remain open for acceptance until noon the next day. At 11:00 a.m. (the next day), B offers to buy the same property for $75,000 and S accepts. At 11:30, A accepts the original offer to buy the property for $50,000. Which of the following statements is TRUE? 
(1)S has entered into a contract with both A and B. 
(2)S could have revoked the offer to A and avoided the problem. 
(3)S has entered into a contract with both A and B. 
(4)All of the above three statements are true.","Answer: 4 Explanation: Option (4) is correct because all of the above statements are true. Option (1) is true because a contract is formed when there is unequivocal acceptance of an offer. When S accepted B’s offer to purchase the property for $75,000, a contract between S and B was formed. Then, when A accepted S’s offer to purchase the property for $50,000 within the time period stipulated in the offer, a contract between A and S was formed. Option (2) is true because an offer expires when the offeror communicates revocation before acceptance, so A would no longer have been able to accept S’s offer. Option (3) is true because S is entitled to accept B’s offer, but S will be liable for damages to A because S cannot convey the property as promised and will be in breach of their contract."
"Question 267: An interest only loan has an original loan amount of $15,000, carries an interest rate of 6.5% per annum, compounded semi-annually, and has monthly payments of $80.17. When will this loan be completely repaid? 
(1)670 months 
(2)696.44934 months 
(3)670 months 
(4)Impossible to determine from the information provided","Answer: 4 Explanation: Option (4) is correct because it is impossible to determine when the loan will be completely repaid with the information given. This is an interest only loan, and no payments are made on the principal. The principal of the loan is completely repaid on a date set between the lender and the borrower. Options (1), (2), and (3) are incorrect for this reason."

"Question 270: Which of the following is required in order for a trading services representative to maintain their licence? 
(1)The representative must be employed by an active brokerage at all times. 
(2)The representative must be licensed as a personal real estate corporation. 
(3)The representative must be employed by an active brokerage at all times. 
(4)The representative must file at least one real estate transaction with the British Columbia Financial Services Authority each year.","Answer: 1 Explanation: Option (1) is correct because an individual must be licensed to and engaged by a brokerage in order to obtain and maintain a licence as a representative. Option (2) is incorrect because although a licensee may wish to incorporate his or her own Personal Real Estate Corporation, it is not a requirement that they do so as long as they are employed under and licensed to a brokerage. Option (3) is incorrect because ensuring the books and records are properly managed is a duty of the managing broker, not a representative. Option (4) is incorrect because there is no requirement for a representative to file at least one real estate transaction with the British Columbia Financial Services Authority each year."
"Question 271: As one lowers a discount (or expected yield) rate, the present value of a given series of future payments: 
(1)decreases. 
(2)could go up or down depending on the timing of the payments. 
(3)decreases. 
(4)remains constant.","Answer: 3 Explanation: Option (3) is correct because the payments of a loan contract are calculated based on a contract yield rate. If the discount, or expected yield rate decreases, the present value of the given contracted payments increases. Options (1), (2), and (4) are incorrect for this reason."
"Question 272: Mary Smith has offered to purchase a house from a seller who is willing to provide partial financing. Her offer is a $75,000 down payment plus a mortgage of $125,000 at 4% per annum, compounded semi-annually. The loan is to be fully amortized with monthly payments of $755.31 over 20 years. If the market rate for similar mortgage loans is 7.5% per annum, compounded semi-annually, what is the market value of this offer, rounded to the nearest dollar? 
(1)$169,579 
(2)$108,618 
(3)$169,579

"Question 273: Earl is the registered fee simple owner of Blackacre. Duke forges and registers a transfer of Blackacre to himself in fee simple. Duke then borrows $50,000 from Royalty Trust Co. The loan is secured against Blackacre by way of a mortgage. Which of the following statements is TRUE? 
(1)Royalty is secure in relying on Duke’s title. 
(2)Earl can recover Blackacre but the title to the property will remain encumbered by Royalty’s mortgage. 
(3)Royalty is secure in relying on Duke’s title. 
(4)Royalty may obtain its $50,000 back from the Assurance Fund.","Answer: 3 Explanation: Option (3) is correct because the principle of indefeasibility will not protect a registered owner who is on title as a result of fraud in which he or she participated. Since Duke forged the transfer document, he is not protected by indefeasibility and Earl will be able to recover title to Blackacre from Duke. The property will not remain encumbered by Royalty’s mortgage because a mortgage is registered as a charge, and charges are not granted indefeasibility; rather, registration of a charge only raises a rebuttable presumption that the charge is valid. Options (1) and (2) are incorrect because the holder of a charge cannot rely on a title holder’s indefeasibility and Earl will be able to rebut the presumption of the validity of the mortgage by showing that Duke was registered on title as a result of forgery. Option (4) is incorrect because a claim against the Assurance Fund can only be successful where the operation of the Land Title Act caused the party to lose his or her interest, and Royalty would not have had an interest in the property at common law under the rule of nemo dat."
"Question 274: A borrower has arranged a loan of $32,000 at an interest rate of 7% per annum, compounded semi-annually with payments set at $1,400 per month. What is the amortization period of the loan?

"Question 275: Which answer MOST accurately describes an official community plan? 
(1)An official community plan is a policy statement regarding the planning of a community that, when adopted by bylaw, must be carried out in every detail by the council. 
(2)When a local government officially adopts a community plan, existing zoning bylaws that do not conform are suspended and land owners’ rights are then directly subject to the official community plan. 
(3)An official community plan is a policy statement regarding the planning of a community that, when adopted by bylaw, must be carried out in every detail by the council. 
(4)An official community plan states the objectives and policies of a local government that guide future decisions on planning and land use management, which represents the longer-term vision for the community.","Answer: 4 Explanation: Option (4) is the correct response because it describes an official community plan. Option (1) is incorrect because a community plan does not require the municipality or regional district to carry out every detail specified in the plan. Rather, it requires that all bylaws enacted, permits issued, and work undertaken after its enactment be consistent with the plan. Option (2) is incorrect because only bylaws enacted subsequent to the enactment of the plan are affected. Option (3) is incorrect because a plan prepared by a regional district may be required to provide the Minister of Municipal Affairs with information regarding public support for the plan, and the minister may require a referendum to determine the degree of public support for the plan."
"Question 276: The risk involved in being a mortgagee (a lender of funds secured by a mortgage) is: 
(1)lower than the risk involved when investing in Canadian government bonds for a similar time period. 
(2)unacceptable to many investors if the interest rate is high enough. 
(3)lower than the risk involved when investing in Canadian government bonds for a similar time period. 
(4)increased due to the greater degree of management time involved.","Answer: 4 Explanation: Option (4) is correct because the risk involved in being a mortgagee is increased due to the greater degree of management time involved. Option (1) is incorrect because mortgage risk is higher than that of Canadian government bonds. Option (2) is incorrect because investors are willing to accept higher risk for higher return; if the interest rate is high enough, investors will accept the risk of lending mortgage funds. Option (3) is incorrect because mortgage risk can also be reduced through careful borrower qualification measures."
"Question 277: On March 7, Allan contracts, in writing, to sell his home to Bob for the price of $100,000. The sale is to complete on March 31. Unknown to either Bob or Allan, the house was destroyed on March 6. Accordingly, there has been: 
(1)a mutual mistake. 
(2)a frustration of the contract. 
(3)a mutual mistake. 
(4)an anticipatory breach.","Answer: 3 Explanation: Option (3) is correct because a common mistake is one where both parties to a contract have made the same mistake about a fundamental term of the contract. Here, both parties have made the mistake of assuming that the home had not been destroyed at the time they entered into the contract. Option (1) is incorrect because a mutual mistake occurs when each party makes a different fundamental mistake about the contract, and in this case the same mistake was made. Option (2) is incorrect because frustration of a contract happens due to events occurring after the contract was entered into, and here the home was destroyed before the contract was formed. Option (4) is incorrect because an anticipatory breach occurs when one party announces that he or she will not perform before the time of performance arrives, which has not occurred in this scenario."
"Question 278: Lawson has rented his warehouse to Tyler, who runs a moving and storage business. Which one of the following is NOT a remedy available to Lawson if Tyler fails to pay his rent? 
(1)Lawson can re-enter the premises and forfeit the rent payable for the balance of the rental period. 
(2)Lawson may seize the personal property of Tyler and sell it in order to pay the arrears of rent. 
(3)Lawson can re-enter the premises and forfeit the rent payable for the balance of the rental period. 
(4)Lawson can apply under the provisions of the Residential Tenancy Act for an arbitrator to be appointed.","Answer: 4 Explanation: Option (4) is correct (i.e., would NOT be available as a remedy to Lawson) because this is a commercial tenancy, and so the Residential Tenancy Act would not apply. Options (1), (2), and (3) are incorrect because each of these remedies WOULD be available to Lawson for non-payment of rent on commercial premises."
"Question 279: Among other factors, the maximum amount that the buyer of a residential property may borrow is NOT affected by: 
(1)the buyer’s income. 
(2)the lending value of the property. 
(3)the buyer’s income. 
(4)the interest adjustment period.","Answer: 4 Explanation: Option (4) is the correct answer as the interest adjustment period of the loan will not affect the maximum amount a borrower may qualify for. Options (1), (2), and (3) are incorrect because with higher income, higher property lending value, and lower mortgage interest rates, a borrower will be able to qualify for a higher maximum loan."

"Question 281: The type of agency relationship that describes the situation where the licensee represents only one party as a client in a given transaction is called a: 
(1)sole agency relationship. 
(2)no agency relationship. 
(3)sole agency relationship. 
(4)full agency relationship.","Answer: 1 Explanation: Option (1) is correct because when a licensee represents only one party as a client in a given transaction, it is called a sole agency relationship. Option (2) is incorrect because an agency relationship exists when a licensee represents a client. Option (3) is incorrect because a limited dual agency relationship exists when a brokerage or licensee acts for multiple parties in a single trade in real estate, but because the duty of loyalty cannot be fulfilled to all clients, the clients agree to a limited form of agency relationship. This practice is now prohibited under section 63 of the Rules. Option (4) is incorrect because an agency relationship is not referred to as a “full agency relationship”."
"Question 282: You have a partially completed appraisal report that you need to fill in. The subject property has 4 bedrooms and 4 bathrooms. The house next door is similar in all respects except for the number of bathrooms and the number of bedrooms. The comparable sold for $221,000 and has 3 bedrooms and 3 bathrooms.

(1)$230,700 
(2)$211,300 
(3)$230,700

In this case, the subject property and the comparable are identical except that the subject property has 1 additional bedroom and 1 additional bathroom. The adjusted sale price is: $221,000 + $4,000 +$5,700 = $230,700."

(3)Honed negotiation skills are essential for handling all aspects of a client’s real estate transactions. 
(4)The single best thing that you can do to improve your negotiation effectiveness is to take detailed notes during negotiations.","Answer: 4 Explanation: Option (4) is correct (false) because the single best thing you can do to improve your negotiation effectiveness is to prepare.

"Question 286: A “subject to” clause in a contract of purchase and sale is correctly known as a: 
(1)condition precedent. 
(2)warranty. 
(3)condition precedent. 
(4)penalty clause.","Answer: 1 Explanation: Option (1) is correct because a condition precedent is a condition in a contract which must be satisfied before the contract is to be performed, and is the formal term for what is usually called a “subject to” clause in the real estate industry. Options (2), (3), and (4) are types of clauses which might be found in a contract that are distinct from “subject to” clauses. Option (2) is incorrect because a warranty is a clause which is not fundamental to the contract and whose breach would not allow a party to terminate the contract, only to sue for damages. Option (3) is incorrect because “subject to” clauses must are conditions precedent (they precede contractual performance) rather than conditions subsequent. Option (4) is incorrect because a penalty clause is a clause which states that a party who breaches the contract must pay a penalty to the innocent party. These clauses will not be enforced by the courts."
"Question 287: Once a licensee has obtained a signed acceptance from Allan of an offer to sell real estate owned by Bob and Carol jointly, the Real Estate Services Act requires the delivery of a copy of the agreement to: 
(1)Allan and Bob. 
(2)Allan, Bob, and Carol. 
(3)Allan and Bob. 
(4)Carol.","Answer: 2 Explanation: Option (2) is correct because the Real Estate Services Act requires a signed copy of the acceptance to be delivered to each of the parties to the transaction. Therefore, Allan, Bob, and Carol each require an individual copy as they are all parties to the transaction. Options (1), (3), and (4) are incorrect because they would each result in a party to the transaction not receiving a signed copy of the agreement."
"Question 288: When attempting to determine whether a particular relationship is that of landlord and tenant or licensor and licensee, it is best to: 
(1)look at the formal wording of the document. 
(2)look at the substance of the agreement between the parties. 
(3)look at the formal wording of the document. 
(4)consult the Commercial Tenancies Act.","Answer: 2 Explanation: Option (2) is correct because the test to determine whether an agreement creates a lease or a licence is a matter of intention between the parties, which is determined by examining the agreement, the surrounding circumstances, and the purpose behind the agreement. Option (1) is incorrect because formal wording and inclusion of terms in an agreement such as “lessor/lessee” or “licensor/licensee” will not necessarily be determinative of parties’ intentions. Options (3) and (4) are incorrect because the Residential Tenancy Act and the Commercial Tenancy Act do not apply to the holder of a licence."
"Question 289: The comparative approach of appraisal is based on an analysis of recent sale prices for similar properties. Which of the following BEST defines the word “recent”? 
(1)A period of time during which at least four properties have sold in the subject property’s neighbourhood 
(2)A period of time of no less than one week and no more than six months 
(3)A period of time during which at least four properties have sold in the subject property’s neighbourhood 
(4)A period of time during which the prime interest rate has been stable","Answer: 3 Explanation: Option (3) is correct because in the comparative approach of appraisal, “recent” refers to a time period during which demand and supply conditions in the area are relatively stable or do not change. “Recent” is the period of time, immediately preceding the appraisal date, during which property values in the region have remained stable. Options (1), (2), and (4) are incorrect for this reason."
"Question 290: Mortgage interest rates are sometimes described as being “sticky”; that is, changes in mortgage rates tend to lag behind changes in bond yields. One reason for this “stickiness” is: 
(1)the short-term nature of a mortgage loan contract. 
(2)the weak secondary mortgage market. 
(3)the short-term nature of a mortgage loan contract. 
(4)all mortgage investments are identical.","Answer: 2 Explanation: Option (2) is correct because a weak secondary market for mortgages means that there are not a large amount of buyers and sellers of mortgages that already exist. Due to this, the investors’ funds are “locked in” to the interest rate written in their original contracts, and they cannot achieve the current rate until the end of the term, or until they recover enough capital to initiate a new mortgage at the new rate. Options (1), (3), and (4) are incorrect because they do not describe reasons for mortgage rates’ “stickiness”."
"Question 291: Hurston, an employee of XYZ Preservatives Ltd., is in the habit of venting a cloud of highly toxic gas into the air at dusk every evening. Once it escapes, the cloud usually drifts over Ralph’s apple orchard. Hurston’s actions are strictly against company policy but by venting the gas Hurston saves time. Hurston is aware that the gas is highly toxic. Ralph has discovered that the emissions have destroyed his apple crop. Which one of the following statements is TRUE? 
(1)XYZ will not be liable for Hurston’s acts because Hurston was acting contrary to XYZ’s rules. 
(2)Ralph may be successful in a claim against XYZ based on the principle of private nuisance. 
(3)XYZ will not be liable for Hurston’s acts because Hurston was acting contrary to XYZ’s rules. 
(4)Ralph would probably have a successful claim against XYZ based on the provisions of the Occupiers Liability Act.","Answer: 2 Explanation: Option (2) is correct because private nuisance occurs when an owner or occupier of land unreasonably and substantially interferes with the reasonable use and enjoyment of a neighbouring property, which includes activities which product noxious fumes. Hurston’s venting highly toxic gas over Ralph’s apple orchard, destroying his crop, would classify as an unreasonable and substantial interference with Ralph’s ability to use and enjoy his land. Option (1) is incorrect because XYZ could be vicariously liable for Hurston’s activities as their employee or negligent for failing to prevent Hurston from creating the nuisance. Option (3) is incorrect because Ralph would have a remedy against Hurston, as the person who created the nuisance is liable for doing so. Option (4) is incorrect because the Occupiers Liability Act would only apply if Ralph and/or his property had been harmed while on XYZ’s property."
"Question 292: A borrower would prefer a straight line principal reduction plan to a constant payment plan if the borrower: 
(1)wishes to delay repayment as long as possible. 
(2)foresees their income decreasing. 
(3)wishes to delay repayment as long as possible. 
(4)wishes to keep their initial payments as low as possible.","Answer: 2 Explanation: Option (2) is correct because a characteristic of a straight line principal reduction loan is that payments will decrease over time. This is favourable to a borrower that expects his or her income to decrease in the future. Option (1) is incorrect because a straight line principal reduction plan does not permit a borrower to delay repayment, as it provides for higher initial payments. Option (3) is incorrect because a borrower who foresees his or her income increasing would prefer to make higher payments in the future, rather than immediately. Option (4) is incorrect because initial payments will be higher than future payments."
"Question 293: Which of the following situations involves a breach of a duty owed by a licensee to a client? 
(1)Julio, a licensee, discovers the property his client Emma is interested in contains asbestos. He immediately discloses this information to Emma. 
(2)Gabriel, a licensee, is asked a complex question about mortgages by his client Koshi. Gabriel, unsure if he has the required expertise to answer the question, refers Koshi to a competent mortgage broker. 
(3)Julio, a licensee, discovers the property his client Emma is interested in contains asbestos. He immediately discloses this information to Emma. 
(4)Simon receives six offers to purchase the house of his clients, the Garfunkels. Although two offers are significantly lower than the rest, he presents every offer to his clients.","Answer: 3 Explanation: Option (3) is correct because the duty of full disclosure requires Billy to disclose all known material information to his client, including the buyer’s intentions for the property. Option (1) is incorrect because Julio has followed his professional obligations and satisfied the duty of full disclosure. Option (2) is incorrect because Gabriel has fulfilled his duty to advise his client to seek independent professional advice on matters outside of his expertise. Option (4) is incorrect because Simon has communicated all of the offers he received to his client and fulfilled his professional obligations."
"Question 294: Which of the following would appear as a debit on the seller’s statement of adjustment? 
(1)The amount of a mortgage that the buyer will assume 
(2)The legal fees involved in discharging a judgment from the seller’s title 
(3)The amount of a mortgage that the buyer will assume 
(4)All of the above would appear as a debit on the seller’s statement","Answer: 4 Explanation: Option (4) is correct because all of the statements would appear as debits on the seller’s statement. Option (1) would appear as a debit on the seller’s statement of adjustments because an existing mortgage on title which will be assumed by the buyer on completion of the sale reduces the amount of cash that the buyer will owe to the seller. For Option (2), the seller is responsible for clearing the title of any encumbrances and any fees for this are the responsibility of the seller, which would reduce the amount of cash due to him or her and would be shown as a debit to the seller. For Option (3), the seller is liable to pay overdue taxes and any penalty owing as a result of late payment. This reduces the amount of cash owed to the seller and would appear as a debit on their statement of adjustments."
"Question 295: As a general principle, which one of the following is the proper method of communicating acceptance of an offer? 
(1)In writing 
(2)In the same form as the offer 
(3)In writing 
(4)By telephone","Answer: 2 Explanation: Option (2) is correct because the offeree should generally communicate acceptance using the same method as the offer was made, if the offer does not specify otherwise. Options (1), (3), and (4) are incorrect because they do not generally describe the proper means of communicating acceptance. Rather, they are methods of communication that are potentially acceptable, depending on the way in which the offer was communicated and the terms of the offer."
"Question 296: Which one of the following transactions does NOT affect the amount of owner’s equity? 
(1)Investments by the owner 
(2)Personal withdrawals from the business 
(3)Investments by the owner 
(4)Purchase of assets by the business","Answer: 4 Explanation: Option (4) is correct because purchasing assets will not affect owner’s equity. The purchase of the assets will either be funded by cash that will result in no net change in assets, or it will be funded by debt, which will increase both assets and liabilities. Option (1) is incorrect because Investment by the owner will increase the amount of equity. Option (2) is incorrect because personal withdrawals from the business will decrease the amount of equity. Option (3) is incorrect because earning net income will also increase the amount of equity."
"Question 297: Where a landlord refuses to allow a commercial tenant to take possession of the demised premises, the tenant may: 
(1)get an order for specific performance. 
(2)maintain an action for breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment. 
(3)get an order for specific performance. 
(4)do none of the above.","Answer: 3 Explanation: Option (3) is correct because there is an implied covenant on the part of a commercial landlord to let the tenant into possession of the leased premises and, if they do not do so, they will be liable for damages. Option (1) is incorrect because a commercial tenant cannot get an order for specific performance in these circumstances due to the common law doctrine of interesse termini, which provides that no estate in land passes until the tenant takes possession. Option (2) is incorrect because quiet enjoyment relates to the tenant’s ability to use and enjoy the premises for all usual purposes without interference or unreasonable disturbance from the landlord, which would apply once the tenant is already in possession of the premises. Option (4) is incorrect because the tenant would be entitled to sue the landlord for damages."
"Question 298: Which one of the following does NOT form part of the definition of market value? 
(1)Value is a price that is reasonably expected to prevail. 
(2)Value is based on the personal opinion of the value to the owner. 
(3)Value is a price that is reasonably expected to prevail. 
(4)The buyer and seller must be bargaining at arm’s length.","Answer: 2 Explanation: Option (2) is the correct answer because this option represents the subjective value to the owner. Market value should be an objective value at a specific point in time. Options (1), (3), and (4) all form part of the definition of market value."
"Question 299: Who may claim a home owner grant? 
(1)Anybody whose name appears on the assessment roll 
(2)The tenant of a property, if they have a lease exceeding three years 
(3)Anybody whose name appears on the assessment roll 
(4)The owner-occupier of a property","Answer: 4 Explanation: Option (4) is correct because the basic criteria to qualify for a home owner grant is that the person claiming the grant must be the owner of the property and must occupy it as a principal residence. Option (1) is incorrect because an owner’s name may appear on the assessment roll, but they would not qualify for a home owner grant if they were not occupying the property. Option (2) is incorrect because a tenant is not an owner of the property. Option (3) is incorrect because an owner must live at the property in order to claim a home owner grant."
"Question 300: To qualify for a managing broker’s licence, a person must possess which one of the following qualifications? 
(1)Have at least five years’ experience as a representative in British Columbia 
(2)Be a Canadian citizen 
(3)Have at least five years’ experience as a representative in British Columbia 
(4)None of the above are qualifications for a managing broker’s licence.","Answer: 3 Explanation: Option (3) is correct because, in addition to the educational and experience requirements, the Real Estate Services Act (RESA) requires that an applicant must be at least 19 years of age. Option (1) is incorrect because qualification for a managing broker’s licence requires a licensee to have been providing real estate services in a Canadian province or the Yukon for at least two years during the five years before the date of the application. Option (2) is incorrect because Canadian citizenship is not required to qualify for a managing broker’s licence. Option (4) is incorrect because a minimum of 19 years of age is required under RESA."
"Question 301: If a licensee falls into the narrow exception in the Rules for the practice of dual agency, they must ensure that which of the following agreements is entered into before providing services within the dual agency relationship? 
(1)An Agreement Regarding Conflict of Interest Between Clients 
(2)A written agreement of dual agency 
(3)An Agreement Regarding Conflict of Interest Between Clients 
(4)A Disclosure of Risks to Unrepresented Parties form","Answer: 2 Explanation: Option (2) is correct because a licensee must obtain a written agreement of dual agency by both clients before providing services within the dual agency relationship. Option (1) is incorrect because an Agreement Regarding Conflict of Interest Between Clients is entered into when a licensee faces a conflict of interest when acting for multiple clients, and obtains written consent by all clients to continue to represent only one client. Option (3) is incorrect because a Disclosure of Interest in Trade form is required when a licensee or an associate of a licensee (being provided real estate services by the licensee) is to directly or indirectly acquire or dispose of real estate. Option (4) is incorrect because a Disclosure of Risks to Unrepresented Parties form is required when a licensee makes a disclosure under section 54 of the Rules to an unrepresented party while also representing a client to that trade in real estate."
"Question 302: It is a violation of the Real Estate Services Rules for a licensee to promise an owner that, if the owner enters into a listing agreement with the licensee’s brokerage, then the licensee will sell the owner’s property within a certain time, UNLESS: 
(1)full disclosure is made to both seller and buyer. 
(2)a signed statement setting forth the details of the promise is given to the person to whom the promise is made when the promise is made. 
(3)full disclosure is made to both seller and buyer. 
(4)a statement under oath acknowledging the promise (but lacking details of the promise) is provided to the person to whom the promise is made.","Answer: 2 Explanation: Option (2) is correct because under sections 49 and 50 of the Rules, licensees are prohibited from making promises to others in an attempt to induce them to enter into service agreements or enter into real estate transactions UNLESS the licensee delivers a signed statement setting out the details of the promise to the person to whom the promise is made. Options (1), (3), and (4) are incorrect because making full disclosure to both the seller and the buyer, sending a copy of such a promise to the British Columbia Financial Services Authority, and providing a statement under oath without details of the promise will not be enough to prevent a violation of the rule if the signed statement containing details is not given to the promisee."

(3)Each strata lot is entitled to one vote, which is given a proportionate decision making value by the strata council in accordance with the unit entitlement of the particular lot. 
(4)The owners of the strata lots that are on the top floor of a residential condominium complex also own the airspace above their individual lots; however, the Strata Property Act restricts the use of the airspace to only those uses that are approved by a special resolution of the strata corporation.","Answer: 3 Explanation: Option (3) is correct because a strata corporation may amend the Standard Bylaws in the Strata Property Act by creating a new custom-made bylaw, but they may not enforce such a bylaw until it has been filed at the land title office. Option (1) is incorrect because a vote’s decision making value is not determined by the lot’s unit entitlement – rather, one vote per lot is given regardless of the size of the lot. Option (2) is incorrect because rental restriction bylaws do not apply to strata units for one full year following their passage or, if there is a tenant in a strata lot on the day the new bylaw is passed, the one-year grace period only begins on the day the tenant vacates the strata lot. Option (4) is incorrect because the strata lot is restricted to its description in the strata plan, and everything outside of that parcel is considered to be common property."

(3)Bylaws are passed by special resolution of the strata council. 
(4)All of the above statements are true.","Answer: 3 Explanation: Option (3) is correct because bylaws govern owners’ obligations as well as their use of the strata lots and the common property and common assets. Option (1) is incorrect because bylaws are passed by the strata corporation, not just the council. Option (2) is incorrect because a strata corporation may only restrict the rental of a strata lot by a bylaw that prohibits the rental of residential strata lots, not commercial. Option (4) is incorrect because Options (1) and (2) are both incorrect."

(3)Drones are generally more expensive than helicopters for capturing aerial photography and videography. 
(4)A Special Flight Operations Certificate is required to operate a drone weighing over 25 kilograms.","Answer: 4 Explanation: Option (4) is correct because Transport Canada requires a Special Flight Operations Certificate for drones weighing over 25 kilograms that are used for commercial purposes such as real estate marketing.

(2)The easement must accommodate the dominant tenement. 
(3)There must be a dominant and servient tenement. 
(4)The easement must be capable of forming the subject matter of a grant.","Answer: 3 Explanation: Option (3) is correct because there is no requirement for the dominant and servient tenements to be owned by different parties in order for an easement to be valid. Options (1), (2), and (4) are incorrect because an easement requires that there be a dominant and servient tenement, that the easement accommodate the dominant tenement, and that the easement be capable of forming the subject matter of a grant in order to be valid."
"Question 311: In British Columbia’s real property taxation system, the actual value of a property is: 
(1)the value at which the property last sold. 
(2)the amount of the tax burden. 
(3)the value at which the property last sold. 
(4)the value shown on the assessment notice.","Answer: 4 Explanation: Option (4) is correct because the Assessment Notice indicates the actual value of a property as determined by the assessor. Options (1), (2), and (3) are incorrect because they refer to concepts which do not determine the actual value of a property."
"Question 312: Corey has offered $431,000 for a house, providing he is able to obtain acceptable financing. The house lists for $442,000, but the lender has determined the lending value is $440,000. The lender requires a loan-to-value ratio of 80% and a gross debt service ratio of 32%. Property taxes are $2,750 per year and Corey’s annual gross income is $75,000.

(2)The ability to expropriate land and add it to the agricultural land reserve 
(3)The ability to exclude land from an agricultural land reserve 
(4)The ability to allow subdivision of agricultural reserve land","Answer: 2 Explanation: Option (2) is correct because expropriating land for the purpose of adding it to the agricultural land reserve is not included in the powers of the Agricultural Land Commission.

(1)Depreciation expense 
(2)Accumulated depreciation 
(3)Depreciation expense 
(4)Interest expense","Answer: 3 Explanation: Option (3) is correct because salaries payable is a liability account because it represents money that is owed to another party. Options (1), (2), and (4) are incorrect because depreciation expense, accumulated depreciation, and interest expense accounts are not classified as a liability because they do not represent a future obligation to pay a third party."
"Question 316: A lease of real property is a contract by which the landlord conveys: 
(1)an easement to the tenant. 
(2)exclusive possession to the tenant. 
(3)an easement to the tenant. 
(4)a right of survivorship to the tenant.","Answer: 2 Explanation: Option (2) is correct because a lease grants exclusive possession of land to another (the tenant) for a specified term. Option (1) is incorrect because an easement is a separate type of interest in land which does not grant exclusive possession, but gives a landowner a limited right to use another’s land for the benefit of his or her land. Option (3) is incorrect because a license creates a privilege for the person who holds it to enter onto property for a certain purpose, but does not confer upon the licensee a lease or any other interest in the property. Option (4) is incorrect because a right of survivorship is a characteristic of a joint tenancy co-ownership whereby the estate automatically vests in surviving joint tenants on the death of a joint tenant."

"Question 318: A borrower approaches a bank for a mortgage loan that has an 80% loan-to-value ratio. The contract rate is 3.9% per annum, compounded semi-annually and the government-specified qualifying rate is 5.25% per annum, compounded semi-annually. At what rate will the borrower have to qualify to fulfil the stress test borrower qualification rule for uninsured mortgages? 
(1)j2 = 5.9% 
(2)j2 = 7.5% 
(3)j2 = 5.9% 
(4)j2 = 3.9%","Answer: 1 Explanation: Option (1) is correct because the mortgage qualifying rate is based on the greater of the government-specified qualifying rate (5.25% as of June 2021) and 2% above the mortgage’s negotiated contract rate. In this case, you would apply a rate of j2 = 5.9% (2% + 3.9%), which is greater than the government-specified rate of j2 = 5.25%."
"Question 319: When Joan was viewing the apartment in a converted house that she was contemplating renting from Zack, she noticed that the steps and the handrail in the back staircase appeared to be in a state of disrepair.

Which of the following statements is TRUE? 
(1)Unless the lease provides that Zack will repair the premises, he has no responsibility to make any repairs. 
(2)Zack is only obligated to make any necessary repairs that are brought to his attention in writing at the time the parties enter the lease. 
(3)Unless the lease provides that Zack will repair the premises, he has no responsibility to make any repairs. 
(4)Zack is obliged by law to maintain the premises in a state of repair that complies with safety standards, irrespective of the condition of the premises at the time the lease was entered.","Answer: 4 Explanation: Option (4) is correct because the landlord’s duty to repair requires that the landlord repair all types of residential premises under section 32 of the Residential Tenancy Act, even if they were in disrepair when the tenancy agreement was made.

"Question 320: The essential distinction between a defect and a stigma is that: 
(1)a stigma increases the value of a property, whereas a defect decreases the value of a property. 
(2)a stigma must always be disclosed to the buyer, whereas a defect need not be disclosed to the buyer. 
(3)a stigma increases the value of a property, whereas a defect decreases the value of a property. 
(4)a stigma’s effect on property value depends on an individual’s subjective considerations, whereas a defect’s impact can be objectively determined.","Answer: 4 Explanation: Option (4) is correct because while a defect’s impact on a property’s value can be objectively determined, a stigma’s effect depends on an individual buyer’s subjective considerations. Some may view the stigma as a liability, while others may not. Option (1) is incorrect because although stigmas can increase the value of a property, they can also decrease its value, depending on the individual buyer’s subjective preferences. Option (2) is incorrect because sellers are generally not required to disclose stigmas unknown to the buyer. Additionally, unlike stigmas, some defects must be disclosed by the seller. Option (3) is incorrect because whether or not the stigma can be discovered through reasonable inspection and inquiries is not a distinguishing feature of a stigma. Further, only certain defects are discoverable upon a reasonable examination."

(2)Each property is unique. 
(3)Buyers and sellers do not necessarily attempt to achieve the greatest profit. 
(4)There are a small number of buyers and sellers relative to the total number of properties.","Answer: 3 Explanation: Option (3) is correct because the sub-market for single-family residences experiences many sales transactions so there is a more abundant flow of market information relating to current prices.

(3)no entry is made on either statement of adjustments. 
(4)the seller’s share of the property taxes will be credited on their statement of adjustments.","Answer: 2 Explanation: Option (2) is correct because the seller’s share of the property taxes will reduce the cash proceeds due to him/her, and thus will be debited on his/her statement of adjustments. Option (1) is incorrect because taxes are apportioned between the parties as of the adjustment date and this is reflected on the statements of adjustments. Option (3) is incorrect because taxes may be paid out of the proceeds where taxes are due but have not yet been paid, whereas in this situation the taxes are not yet due.

(3)a restrictive covenant. 
(4)an easement.","Answer: 4 Explanation: Option (4) is correct because the document grants a right of way, which is a form of easement, to Mary for the benefit of her land (the dominant tenement) over John’s land (the servient tenement). Option (1) is incorrect because a restrictive covenant imposes a restriction on the use of one person’s land for the benefit of another, and this document grants a positive right to use the land rather than a restriction. Option (2) is incorrect because a lease grants a right to possession for a certain amount of time, whereas this interest does not have an end date attached to it and it does not grant exclusive possession to the property. Option (3) is incorrect because a license is a privilege to enter onto premises for a certain purpose that is a personal right (i.e. can only be exercised by the person to whom it was granted) whereas this right is an interest which runs with the property rather than to Mary exclusively."
"Question 336: In using the cost approach, the MAJOR difficulty is experienced in calculating: 
(1)curable physical depreciation. 
(2)curable functional depreciation. 
(3)curable physical depreciation. 
(4)replacement cost of the building as new.","Answer: 3 Explanation: Option (3) is correct because in using the cost approach of appraisal, the major difficulty is experienced in calculating incurable physical depreciation. The cause of the difficulty lies in determining the economic life of the building. Options (1), (2), and (4) are incorrect for this reason."
"Question 337: You are to appraise a single-family dwelling in an ordinary neighbourhood. If supply and demand factors have remained relatively stable for the last three months, a good comparable property is a similar property that: 
(1)has just been sold at a below-market price through a court ordered sale. 
(2)after two months’ exposure to the market, was sold one week ago. 
(3)has just been sold at a below-market price through a court ordered sale. 
(4)was sold at an above-market price four months ago.","Answer: 2 Explanation: Option (2) is correct because if supply and demand factors have remained relatively stable for the last 3 months, a good comparable property is a similar property that sold one week ago, after two months exposure to the market. This is the best comparable because the comparative approach is built on the premise that the market value of the subject property will be equal to the prices recently paid for similar properties. Options (1) and (4) are incorrect because they do not represent the market value of similar properties. Option (3) is incorrect because this similar property has not sold."
"Question 338: You have a partially completed appraisal report that you need to fill in. The 2,300 square foot subject property has 4 bedrooms. The house next door is similar in all respects except for the number of bedrooms and square footage. The 2,200 square foot comparable sold for $321,000 and has 3 bedrooms. If the market value of a bedroom is $3,200 and above an 1,800 sq. ft. benchmark, each 100 sq. ft. is worth $5,000, the adjusted sale price for this comparable is: 
(1)$329,200 
(2)$312,800 
(3)$329,200 
(4)$318,300","Answer: 1 Explanation: Option (1) is correct because to find the adjusted sale price of the comparable, take the sum of the listed sale price with its adjustments to the subject property. In this case, the subject property and the comparable are identical except that the subject property has 1 additional bedroom and is 100 square feet larger. The adjusted sale price is: $321,000 + $3,200 + $5,000 = $329,200."
"Question 339: “Reproduction cost” is best defined as: 
(1)the current construction cost of a building that would provide the same utility as the subject property. 
(2)the current cost of moving the building to a site where the building would represent the highest and best use of that site. 
(3)the current construction cost of a building that would provide the same utility as the subject property. 
(4)the original cost of construction, adjusted for inflation.","Answer: 3 Explanation: Option (3) is correct because reproduction cost is the current cost of constructing an exact replica of the subject property. Options (1), (2), and (4) are incorrect for this reason."
"Question 340: Which one of the following statements is FALSE? 
(1)A deposit is held by the brokerage as a stakeholder until the real estate transaction is completed. 
(2)Unless a deposit is paid when an offer to purchase is made, there is no binding contract for purchase and sale. 
(3)A deposit is held by the brokerage as a stakeholder until the real estate transaction is completed. 
(4)Once an offer has been accepted, the brokerage may only return the deposit if all parties to the contract consent in writing to the release of the deposit.","Answer: 2 Explanation: Option (2) is correct (FALSE) because a binding contract of purchase and sale can be created if there is an offer, acceptance, and consideration. The exchange of promises to convey title to the property in return for the purchase price is valid consideration, even without a deposit. Options (1), (3), and (4) are incorrect because they are TRUE statements."
"Question 341: Which one of the following real properties must be assessed at market value for purposes of real property taxation? 
(1)A small house, surrounded by warehouse properties, owned continuously by one owner since January, 1946 
(2)Shell Oil pipelines 
(3)A small house, surrounded by warehouse properties, owned continuously by one owner since January, 1946 
(4)Land in the agricultural land reserve, which is also classified as farmland under the Assessment Act","Answer: 3 Explanation: Option (3) is correct because an ordinary residential property is assessed at market (actual) value. Option (1) is incorrect because it would qualify as a special residential property and could be assessed according to the value based solely on the current residential use. Option (2) is incorrect because pipelines are classified under Major Industry property and are assessed on a separate basis due to difficulty in determining actual value. Option (4) is incorrect because for real estate classified as farm land, the assessor must consider only the value of the property as a farm and exclude value attributable to any other potential uses (i.e. value in use is considered rather than actual value)."
"Question 342: On an interest accruing mortgage, which one of the following interest rates would result in the highest outstanding balance?

"Question 344: Given that all other factors are identical, the longer the term of the contract on a bonused, partially amortized mortgage (where the bonus is paid by the borrower): 
(1)the lower the effective interest rate paid by the borrower. 
(2)the higher the effective interest rate paid by the borrower. 
(3)the lower the effective interest rate paid by the borrower. 
(4)the higher the outstanding balance at the term’s end.","Answer: 1 Explanation: Option (1) is correct because all things being equal, a longer term on a bonused partially amortized loan will result in a lower effective interest rate paid by the borrower. This is because the value of the bonus is paid off over a longer term, thus decreasing the annual cost of borrowing. Options (2), (3), and (4) are incorrect for this reason."
"Question 345: Sam and Sally recently negotiated a second mortgage in the amount of $25,000 at an interest rate of 9% per annum, compounded semi-annually. The loan is to be amortized over 20 years by monthly payments. As a result of a $3,000 brokerage fee, assume that only $22,000 of the loan’s $25,000 face value is advanced to Sam and Sally. The effective annual rate of interest charged on the funds advanced will be: 
(1)less than the effective annual equivalent of the contract interest rate.

"Question 346: Which of the following options is the generally accepted accounting principle that holds that all accounting information should be reported on objectively determined and verifiable data? 
(1)Consistency principle 
(2)Verification principle 
(3)Consistency principle 
(4)Objectivity principle","Answer: 4 Explanation: Option (4) is correct because the objectivity principle states that all accounting information needs to be objectively determined, as well as verifiable. Option (1) is incorrect because the consistency principle states that once an accounting policy is adopted, the company must continue to use the same policy in the future. Option (2) is incorrect because the verification principle is not a generally accepted accounting principle. Option (3) is incorrect because the materiality principle is not studied in this course."
"Question 347: Which of the following is NOT a procedure commonly used by a large institutional lender in order to reduce the risk associated with a particular mortgage loan? 
(1)Reduction of the loan-to-value ratio 
(2)Increase in the interest rate charged 
(3)Reduction of the loan-to-value ratio 
(4)Reduction in the total debt service ratio","Answer: 2 Explanation: Option (2) is correct because increasing the interest rate is a way to accommodate increased risk by providing increased return for the lender, but this does not reduce the risk. In fact, a higher interest rate will result in a higher payment, making the risk of default even greater. Options (1), (3), and (4) are incorrect because they represent ways that a lender can reduce risk."
"Question 348: Where an offer has been made by post, an acceptance by post will be effective: 
(1)when posted. 
(2)when received. 
(3)when posted. 
(4)when posted, provided it is not lost in the mail.","Answer: 1 Explanation: Option (1) is correct because where acceptance is intended to be by non-instantaneous means, which includes by post, the acceptance is effective when it is put in the mail rather than when it is actually received. If the acceptance is lost in the mail, there is still a binding contract as long as the offeree can prove the acceptance was actually mailed. For these reasons, Options (2), (3), and (4) are incorrect."
"Question 349: Which of the following is NOT a requirement of the Real Estate Development Marketing Act to protect the public? 
(1)Developers must meet any preliminary requirements or approvals applicable to the type of property being marketed. 
(2)Developers must assure the buyer's title upon purchase. 
(3)Developers must meet any preliminary requirements or approvals applicable to the type of property being marketed. 
(4)Developers must consult with members of the public over any proposed developments.","Answer: 4 Explanation: Option (4) is correct because there is no requirement for developers to consult with the public over proposed developments under the Real Estate Development Marketing Act (REDMA). Options (1), (2), and (3) are incorrect because developers are required to do each of these things under REDMA. Its purpose is to protect purchasers by requiring developers who market or intend to market development units in development properties to: meet any preliminary requirements or approvals applicable to the type of property to be marketed; ensure appropriate steps are taken to pay the cost of utilities or other related services and to assure the purchaser’s title (or other interest) upon purchase; and prepare and file a disclosure option in the form required by the BC Financial Services Authority."
"Question 350: Which one of the following is NOT a remedy available to the owner of a strata lot who is dissatisfied with certain actions of the strata corporation? 
(1)The owner may obtain a mandatory injunction against the strata corporation. 
(2)The owner may file a lien against the strata corporation. 
(3)The owner may obtain a mandatory injunction against the strata corporation. 
(4)The owner may apply to the Supreme Court of British Columbia for an order requiring the strata corporation to comply with the Strata Property Act.","Answer: 2 Explanation: Option (2) is correct because an owner cannot file a lien against the strata corporation because they are dissatisfied with the corporation’s actions. However, if an owner sues a strata corporation and succeeds, they may receive a judgment against the strata corporation. Options (1), (3), and (4) are incorrect because they are all remedies available under the Strata Property Act to an owner who is dissatisfied with acts of the strata corporation."
"Question 351: After determining that there are reasonable grounds to suspect that a transaction is related to a money laundering or terrorist financing offence, when must a licensee file a Suspicious Transaction Report? 
(1)After receiving approval from the licensee’s managing broker 
(2)When directed to file by a local law enforcement agency 
(3)After receiving approval from the licensee’s managing broker 
(4)Within 15 days of receiving any funds from the client","Answer: 3 Explanation: Option (3) is correct because a licensee is required to file a Suspicious Transaction Report (STR) as soon as practicable. Option (1) is incorrect because individual licensees have an obligation under the Proceeds of Crime (Money Laundering) and Terrorist Financing Act to file STRs, whether or not the managing broker approves. Option (2) is incorrect because law enforcement direction is not required to file an STR. Option (4) is incorrect because it is the requirement for filing a Large Cash Transaction Report. There is no specified number of days required for filing an STR, because the requirement is that it be filed as soon as practicable."
"Question 352: Which of the following statements is TRUE under the Torrens system in British Columbia? 
(1)A person whose fee simple title was transferred by a void deed can always recover title upon proving that they were the rightful owner. 
(2)The indefeasibility principle expresses the fundamental tenet that one cannot give what one does not have. 
(3)A person whose fee simple title was transferred by a void deed can always recover title upon proving that they were the rightful owner. 
(4)Registered fee simple owners enjoy the guarantee of indefeasibility but registered chargeholders do not.","Answer: 4 Explanation: Option (4) is correct because in British Columbia, only fee simple owners are protected by the guarantee of indefeasibility. In Gill v. Bucholtz (2009) the British Columbia Court of Appeal confirmed that the Land Tile Act preserves the common law principle that “one cannot give another person that property which one does not have” with respect to registered charges. Options (1) and (3) are incorrect because under British Columbia’s Torrens system, the indefeasibility principle provides that when a person is named on a certificate of title as the owner of the fee simple estate in land, that is conclusive proof that he or she is entitled to that fee simple estate. Therefore, a fee simple owner cannot recover title from a good faith purchaser who acquires fee simple title by way of a void deed. Option (2) is incorrect because nemo dat quod non habet is the fundamental common law tenet that one cannot give what one does not have, which would protect the rightful owner. The indefeasibility principle protects the registered fee simple owner."
"Question 353: In conducting an appraisal, a market analysis is undertaken covering a range of factors. Which of the following is NOT a reason for including a market analysis in an appraisal report? 
(1)To indicate the current status of the subject property in relation to trends in property values 
(2)To confirm that comparable properties have been selected from the same market as the subject property and are subject to the same market forces 
(3)To indicate the current status of the subject property in relation to trends in property values 
(4)To reconcile the market value","Answer: 4 Explanation: Option (4) is the correct answer as reconciling the market value of the subject property is not a reason to include a market analysis in the appraisal report. Options (1), (2) and (3) are incorrect because they are valid reasons to include the market analysis in the appraisal report."
"Question 354: When an agent acting within the scope of their authority and having disclosed that they are acting as an agent enters into a contract with a third party, the parties to that contract are: 
(1)the agent and the principal. 
(2)the principal and the third party. 
(3)the agent and the principal. 
(4)the principal, the agent, and the third party.","Answer: 2 Explanation: Option (2) is correct because an agent is a person authorized to act on behalf of another person, the principal, so that they represent the principal in dealings with third parties. Therefore, while the agent is acting within the scope of his authority as an agent and after having disclosed that he is an agent for the principal, the contract will be between the principal for whom the agent is acting and the third party. Option (1) is incorrect because, although there would be a contract between the agent and the principal in order to establish the agency relationship, in this case the contract is with a third party. Options (3) and (4) are incorrect because the agent is acting on behalf of the principal as if he were stepping into the principal’s shoes rather than contracting for himself; therefore, the agent is not party to the agreement."
"Question 355: A lease granted by a tenant for a term that is less than the whole of their remaining interest granted in the original lease is referred to as: 
(1)an assignment. 
(2)a tenancy by sufferance. 
(3)an assignment. 
(4)a tenancy at will.","Answer: 3 Explanation: Option (3) is correct because a sub-lease is a lease by the original tenant (the sub-landlord) to a third party for less than the total remainder of the sub-landlord’s original lease term. Option (1) is incorrect because an assignment is the transfer by a party of all of the party’s interest in a property, i.e. for the total remainder of the lease term rather than a portion of it. Option (2) is incorrect because a tenancy by sufferance occurs when there is no tenancy because no lease exists. For example, if a tenant does not move out of the leased premises upon the expiration of the term of the lease. Option (4) is incorrect because a tenancy at will is where the tenant, with the consent of the landlord, occupies land as a tenant for a term which can be terminated by either party at any time."
"Question 356: Benson has purchased a home from Vanessa. The sale is completed on April 15 and the property taxes are adjusted on the completion date. Property taxes are due on July 1. In this case: 
(1)Vanessa will have to pay Benson for the share of the taxes from January 1 through April 14. 
(2)Vanessa and Benson will each pay ½ of the current year’s taxes on July 1 when they are due. 
(3)Vanessa will have to pay Benson for the share of the taxes from January 1 through April 14. 
(4)Neither Vanessa nor Benson will have to pay any taxes on July 1 because the sale completed on April 15.","Answer: 1 Explanation: Option (1) is correct because where property taxes are to be paid in the future by the buyer, the seller owes the share of taxes from January 1 up to the adjustment date, in this case, up to April 14 as the adjustment date is April 15. Option (2) is incorrect because taxes are split according to the proportion of the year that each party has ownership of the property rather than an equal split. Option (3) is incorrect because Benson is responsible for paying taxes on July 1. Vanessa will have to pay Benson for her share of taxes from January 1 through April 14. Option (4) is incorrect because the property taxes will have to be paid regardless of when the sale completes."
"Question 357: A statement of profit and loss measures which of the following? 
(1)Assets acquired during a certain period of time 
(2)Revenues and expenses for a certain period of time 
(3)Assets acquired during a certain period of time 
(4)Assets and liabilities held at a single point in time","Answer: 2 Explanation: Option (2) is correct because the statement of profit and loss, also known as the income statement, measures revenues and expenses for a certain time period. Option (1) is incorrect because there is no financial statement that reflects the acquisition of assets of a certain period of time. Option (3) is incorrect because there is no financial statement that measures the revenues accrued at a single point in time. Option (4) is incorrect because the balance sheet is the financial statement that measures the assets and liabilities held at a single point in time."
"Question 358: The greatest bundle of rights and responsibilities that an individual can hold with respect to land is: 
(1)a fee simple interest. 
(2)a 99-year lease. 
(3)a fee simple interest. 
(4)a life estate pur autre vie.","Answer: 1 Explanation: Option (1) is correct because the estate in fee simple is the greatest estate in Canadian law, equivalent to what we ordinarily think of as outright ownership of real property, where the owner has rights to the land for so long as he or she has heirs. This includes the right to freely use and enjoy it, sell it, rent or lease it, grant mortgages or easements or other interests in land, and to dispose of it under the terms of a will. Options (2) and (4) are incorrect because leasehold estates and estates pur autre vie are estates in land less than fee simple since the interests have a prescribed end date and other conditions or obligations attached to the use and enjoyment of the land. Option (3) is incorrect because an easement is an interest in land less than an estate as it is a limited right to use another’s land rather than a full right to possession of the property."
"Question 359: With respect to the valuation of real property, value to the owner is most often required to be estimated in the context of: 
(1)churches and heritage buildings. 
(2)investment analysis. 
(3)churches and heritage buildings. 
(4)mortgage lending practice.","Answer: 2 Explanation: Option (2) is the correct answer because the value to owner cannot be used in appraisal, but may be used in investment analysis. Options (1), (3), and (4) are incorrect for this reason."
"Question 360: Which of the following correctly lists goods from the LEAST amount of shopping effort required to the MOST amount of shopping effort required? 
(1)Convenience goods, shopping goods, specialty goods, unsought goods 
(2)Shopping goods, convenience goods, unsought goods, specialty goods 
(3)Convenience goods, shopping goods, specialty goods, unsought goods 
(4)Convenience goods, unsought goods, specialty goods, shopping goods","Answer: 3 Explanation: Option (3) is correct because the shopping behaviour model classifies products and services based on the amount of effort that a consumer is willing to go through to obtain that product or service. In order of the amount of effort required by the consumer, from the least effort to the most effort, the goods are unsought goods, convenience goods, shopping goods, and specialty goods. Options (1), (2), and (4) are incorrect for this reason."
"Question 361: Which marketing effort focuses on a relatively small, but active and growing, target market? 
(1)Undifferentiated marketing 
(2)Differentiated marketing 
(3)Undifferentiated marketing 
(4)Niche marketing",Answer: 4 Explanation: Option (4) is correct because niche marketing focuses on a relatively small but active and growing target market. Option (1) is incorrect because undifferentiated marketing is when a single product or service is marketed to all potential consumers with a single marketing program. Option (2) is incorrect because differentiated marketing refers to numerous similar products being marketed to different market segments using different marketing programs. Option (3) is incorrect because specialty marketing is a term not used in this course.

"Question 363: When completing a listing contract, a licensee should: 
(1)rely on all of the information provided by the seller. 
(2)only rely on the seller’s information if the seller says they have checked it. 
(3)rely on all of the information provided by the seller. 
(4)use the seller’s information, but advise all buyers that it is unreliable.","Answer: 3 Explanation: Option (3) is correct because a listing licensee has a duty to verify information for the listing and may be liable if they fail to do so and the buyers incur damages as a result. Options (1), (2), and (4) are incorrect because they would not meet the licensee’s duty to independently check the information provided to them by the seller where possible."
"Question 364: An assignment of a commercial lease may be made by a tenant to a third party: 
(1)only if there is an express provision in the lease allowing the tenant to do so. 
(2)only if the tenant has a licence to do so from the landlord. 
(3)only if there is an express provision in the lease allowing the tenant to do so. 
(4)unless the tenant is specifically prevented from doing so by a covenant in the lease.","Answer: 4 Explanation: Option (4) is correct because a tenant under a commercial lease may assign without the consent of the landlord unless there is an express prohibition in the lease. Options (1), (2), and (3) are incorrect because the presumption is that assignment is allowed unless otherwise specified in the lease, and none of the situations in these options are required for the presumption to prevail."
"Question 365: A developer of land not located in a municipality filed the necessary disclosure statement with the British Columbia Financial Services Authority with respect to his 20 lot subdivision. After foreclosure proceedings, the developer’s bank became the owner of the subdivision. The bank wishes to sell the lots on an individual basis. Which one of the following statements is TRUE? 
(1)Because the bank is selling more than five lots, it should file a disclosure statement with the British Columbia Financial Services Authority. 
(2)A further disclosure statement is not necessary. 
(3)Because the bank is selling more than five lots, it should file a disclosure statement with the British Columbia Financial Services Authority. 
(4)Because there has been a foreclosure, the bank is obligated to file a prospectus rather than a disclosure statement.","Answer: 1 Explanation: Option (1) is correct because under the Real Estate Development Marketing Act, a new disclosure statement is required when the identity of the developer changes. A developer is defined as a person who, directly or indirectly owns, leases or has a right to acquire or dispose of development property, subject to exclusion by regulation. Therefore, the bank would be considered a new developer and would have to file a new disclosure statement. For this reason, Options (2) and (3) are incorrect. Option (4) is incorrect because there is no requirement to file a prospectus rather than a disclosure statement in the event of a foreclosure."
"Question 366: Which one of the following statements is FALSE? 
(1)Given that the net operating income remains constant, the market value of a property falls as the required yield rises. 
(2)The market value of an income-producing property is best determined by averaging the sale prices of any three other income producing properties that have recently sold. 
(3)Given that the net operating income remains constant, the market value of a property falls as the required yield rises. 
(4)The capitalization rate applied to the net operating income of an investment property is related to the yield on comparable investment properties.","Answer: 2 Explanation: Option (2) is correct because, in the income approach of appraisal, the market value for any particular real estate property is determined by the yields that prospective purchasers reasonably expect to earn. Options (1), (3), and (4) are true and are therefore incorrect."
"Question 367: Which of the following is NOT a Personal Information Protection Act (PIPA) privacy principle? 
(1)Provide recourse 
(2)Obtain consent 
(3)Provide recourse 
(4)Limit use, disclosure, and retention","Answer: 3 Explanation: Option (3) is correct because “identify the proposal” is not one of the 10 privacy principles provided for under the Personal Information Protection Act (PIPA). Option (1) is incorrect because Principle 10 is to provide recourse. Option (2) is incorrect because Principle 2 is to obtain consent. Option (4) is incorrect because Principle 5 provides for limiting use, disclosure, and retention."
"Question 368: In commercial mortgage underwriting, the factor calculated by dividing the annual net operating income by the annual sum of monthly mortgage payments is referred to as the: 
(1)safety margin factor. 
(2)mortgage ratio. 
(3)safety margin factor. 
(4)annual mortgage constant.","Answer: 3 Explanation: Option (3) is correct because the debt coverage ratio is calculated by dividing the annual net operating income by the annual sum of mortgage payments. Options (1), (2), and (4) are incorrect for this reason."
"Question 369: A counter-offer has the effect in law of: 
(1)leaving the original offer open for acceptance if the counter-offer is refused. 
(2)terminating the original offer so that later it cannot be accepted. 
(3)leaving the original offer open for acceptance if the counter-offer is refused. 
(4)accepting the original offer.","Answer: 2 Explanation: Option (2) is correct because a counter-offer terminates the original offer to become the new offer. Option (1) is incorrect because if the counteroffer is not accepted, the offeree cannot accept the first offer because it has already terminated. Option (3) is incorrect because a counter-offer does not terminate all negotiations, just the original offer. Option (4) is incorrect because a counter-offer does not have the effect of accepting the original offer but rather suggests new terms."
"Question 370: Which of the following events will terminate an agency relationship? 
(1)Revocation of the agency by the principal 
(2)Frustration 
(3)Revocation of the agency by the principal 
(4)All of the above","Answer: 4 Explanation: Option (4) is correct because Options (1), (2), and (3) all constitute events which will end an agency relationship. If a principal revokes the authority of the agent orally or by conduct, the agency will be terminated. An event which frustrates the continuation of the agency contract would also terminate the relationship. Finally, once an agent has performed the actions for which he or she was given authority in the agency contract, the agency relationship will be over as an agent cannot act outside his or her scope of authority."

"Question 372: Charlie Brown and his sister, Sally, moved in next door to the house owned by Lucy VanPelt. Every afternoon, Lucy’s friend and tenant, Schroeder, a concert pianist, would practise on the VanPelt grand piano. Unfortunately, Sally, who worked the night shift, was a very light sleeper and was unable to sleep during Schroeder’s rehearsals. At Sally’s request, Charlie explained to his new neighbour that the piano playing caused the Brown house to vibrate, and Sally could not sleep. Lucy just replied, “Too bad,” and slammed the door on Charlie’s face. Which of the following statements is TRUE? 
(1)Lucy could successfully defend an action in private nuisance brought by the Browns for the piano vibrations by pleading volenti non fit injuriae, that is, that the Browns moved to the nuisance. 
(2)Sally’s condition of being a light sleeper would be a relevant factor in measuring the reasonableness of the noise, and Lucy will have to consider Sally’s condition in assessing her own conduct. 
(3)Lucy could successfully defend an action in private nuisance brought by the Browns for the piano vibrations by pleading volenti non fit injuriae, that is, that the Browns moved to the nuisance. 
(4)If Charlie and Sally brought an action, only Lucy, as the landlord and occupier of the land would be liable for the nuisance.","Answer: 3 Explanation: Option (3) is correct because the two types of damages recognized in the case of a private nuisance are unreasonable interference with another occupier’s use and enjoyment of property, and interference which causes physical damage to the property. Option (1) is incorrect because the courts have held that it is no defence to a nuisance action to say that the plaintiff came to the nuisance. Option (2) is incorrect because the standard against which reasonableness is measured is that of the average reasonable person, and it is not relevant that a plaintiff happens to be unusually sensitive unless the defendant seeks to take advantage of that fact. Option (4) is incorrect because the person who creates the nuisance (in this case, Schroeder) is liable for creating it, and in a landlord and tenant situation, the tenant occupier is primarily liable for nuisances created on the property."
"Question 373: Which of the following is the main reason that interest accruing loans are normally written for short terms? 
(1)For long terms, borrowers generally prefer to make periodic payments. 
(2)Total payments decline over the term of an interest accruing loan, so the sooner the loan is refinanced, the higher the potential return to the lender. 
(3)For long terms, borrowers generally prefer to make periodic payments. 
(4)The outstanding balance of an interest accruing loan declines over the term of the loan, so it is prudent for the lender to keep the term short.","Answer: 3 Explanation: Option (3) is correct because an interest accruing loan poses a high risk to the lender, since the entire amount of principal and interest is outstanding for the entire length of the term. Due to this, these loans are typically written for short terms. Option (1) is incorrect because although it is a true statement, it is not the reason interest accruing loans are written for short terms. Options (2) and (4) are incorrect because they are false statements."
"Question 374: Sue purchased a townhouse in December 20X2 for $145,000. Five years later, it was appraised at $260,000. Seven years after the townhouse was purchased, Sue sold the townhouse for $190,000. What was the pre-tax yield on her investment expressed as an effective annual rate?

"Question 375: Where a condition precedent is inserted in a contract of purchase and sale, a licensee might also include a “time clause”. Which of the following definitions accurately describes such a clause? 
(1)The clause requires the removal of the condition precedent within a reasonable time. 
(2)The clause states specifically the date by which the condition precedent must be removed. 
(3)The clause requires the removal of the condition precedent within a reasonable time. 
(4)None of the above three statements accurately describes a “time clause”.","Answer: 3 Explanation: Option (3) is correct because a time clause in a contract for purchase and sale of land allows a party to invoke a time period in which a condition precedent must be removed, where the right to invoke the clause arises on the vendor receiving another offer after entering the original contract of purchase and sale. Option (1) is incorrect because it must be for a specified time period, not just a “reasonable time.” Option (2) is incorrect because the date by which the condition precedent must be removed depends on the vendor receiving another offer, and so the time period is set out in the contract during which the condition must be removed rather than a specified date. Option (4) is incorrect because Option (3) correctly describes a time clause."

"Question 377: Listed below is one of the most important powers given to municipal councils in regulating the subdivision of land. Identify it. 
(1)They may require that all lots within the proposed subdivision be capable of being served by cable television. 
(2)They may require that all residential units within the proposed subdivision be in excess of a certain construction value specified in the bylaw. 
(3)They may require that all lots within the proposed subdivision be capable of being served by cable television. 
(4)They may require that highways of a prescribed standard be provided as well as street lighting and underground wiring.","Answer: 4 Explanation: Option (4) is correct because the Local Government Act provides that subdivision bylaws created by municipal councils may regulate the location, width, alignment and grade of highways and may also require that the subdivider provide street lighting and underground (as well as wiring, water, sewer and drainage systems, fire hydrants, and roads) within the subdivision. Options (1), (2), and (3) are incorrect because they are outside of the scope of what bylaws created by municipal council are permitted to regulate with regard to the subdivision of land."
"Question 378: From the point of view of the lender, the interest charged on a mortgage does NOT represent: 
(1)a payment for a portion of the general overhead and operating costs of the lender. 
(2)the cost of financing the lender’s debt. 
(3)a payment for a portion of the general overhead and operating costs of the lender. 
(4)a return on capital invested.","Answer: 2 Explanation: Option (2) is the correct answer as it is the only option that is not represented by interest received by a lender. Interest due or paid represents the cost of financing debt, not interest received. Options (1), (3), and (4) all represent interest charged on a mortgage and are therefore incorrect."
"Question 379: The relationship between a brokerage and its related licensees is recognized and reinforced by certain provisions of the Real Estate Services Act (“RESA”). According to RESA: 
(1)when a licensee advertises real estate on behalf of a client, the brokerage’s name must be displayed in a prominent way. 
(2)a licensee is entitled to advertise real estate on behalf of a client without the name of the listing brokerage appearing in the advertisement, providing the licensee’s name is displayed in a prominent way. 
(3)when a licensee advertises real estate on behalf of a client, the brokerage’s name must be displayed in a prominent way. 
(4)real estate brokerages that charge only desk fees and pay 100% of the commission to their representatives are not responsible for the actions of the representatives.","Answer: 1 Explanation: Option (1) is correct because under section 40 of the Rules, when a licensee advertises real estate, the name of the brokerage must be displayed in a prominent and easily readable way. Options (2), (3), and (4) are not provided for under the Real Estate Services Act and are therefore incorrect."
"Question 380: Which one of the following items is deducted from gross realized income to arrive at net operating income when preparing an appraisal using the income approach? 
(1)Income tax 
(2)Interest on the mortgage 
(3)Income tax 
(4)Depreciation expense","Answer: 3 Explanation: Option (3) is correct because real property taxes are a component of operating expenses, which are deducted from gross realized income to arrive at net operating income when preparing an appraisal using the income approach. Options (1), (2), and (4) are incorrect because income tax, interest on a mortgage, and depreciation expense are not included in operating expenses and do not factor into the calculation of net operating income."
"Question 381: A tenancy that automatically renews itself on the last day of the term for a further term of the same duration until terminated by either party with proper notice is called a: 
(1)tenancy at will. 
(2)tenancy at sufferance. 
(3)tenancy at will. 
(4)term fixed tenancy.","Answer: 3 Explanation: Option (3) is correct because a periodic tenancy is one which automatically renews itself on the last day of the term for a further term of the same length until it is terminated by either party with proper notice. Option (1) is incorrect because a tenancy at will is a tenancy where a tenant, with the consent of the landlord, occupies land for a term which can be terminated by either party at any time. Option (2) is incorrect because a tenancy at sufferance occurs when there is no tenancy because no lease exists, for example, if a tenant does not move out of the leased premises upon the expiration of the term of the lease. Option (4) is incorrect because a fixed term tenancy has a predetermined date at which the tenancy expires."

"Question 384: When a judge “distinguishes” a case on its facts, this means: 
(1)the judge decides that facts crucial to a former decision are not present in the case at hand, and does not follow the former decision. 
(2)the judge formally reports the case before them because it is a crucial decision. 
(3)the judge decides that facts crucial to a former decision are not present in the case at hand, and does not follow the former decision. 
(4)the judge refers the case to an appeal court because of its difficulty.","Answer: 1 Explanation: Option (1) is correct (and therefore Options (2), (3), and (4) are incorrect) because distinguishing a case occurs when a judge decides the factual circumstance of the case at hand is not similar enough to the former decision to warrant following the judgment, and therefore the decision will not be binding on the judge."
"Question 385: Which of the following could appear as a charge on a Certificate of Title? 
(1)A notation that the property is held in a trust for a specified beneficiary 
(2)An easement in favour of a local telecommunications company 
(3)A notation that the property is held in a trust for a specified beneficiary 
(4)A notice that the duplicate certificate of title has been taken out of the land title office","Answer: 2 Explanation: A charge is any interest in land less than a fee simple. Rights of way, liens, mortgages, and easements are all examples of charges. Option (2) is correct because an easement is a type of interest in land less than a fee simple that can be registered under the Land Title Act and thus may appear on a Certificate of Title as a charge. Options (1), (3) and (4) are incorrect because while indications of all of these circumstances may appear on a Certificate of Title, none of them necessarily indicate an estate or interest in land, and so they do not constitute a charge."

(1)$208,373 
(2)$180,000 
(3)$208,373

"Question 387: Which of the following would generally NOT be found in the current liabilities section of a balance sheet? 
(1)Current portion of long-term debt 
(2)Property taxes payable 
(3)Current portion of long-term debt 
(4)Rent receivable","Answer: 4 Explanation: Option (4) is correct because rent receivable is the only option that would not be found in the current liabilities section. Current liabilities are those debts that are expected to be repaid within the next year, and rent receivable is not a debt that is payable, it is an asset that is receivable. Options (1), (2), and (3) are incorrect because they are all current liabilities."

(3)the present use of the property. 
(4)a comprehensive list of factors including all of those mentioned above.","Answer: 4 Explanation: Option (4) is correct (and Options (1), (2), and (3) are incorrect) because the Assessment Act states that factors which the assessor may consider in determining actual value include: present use, location, original cost, replacement cost, revenue or rental value, selling price of the land and improvements and comparable land improvements, economic and functional obsolescence, and any other circumstances affecting value."
"Question 389: Where a buyer under a standard contract of purchase and sale refuses to perform, the seller will NOT have which of the following remedies? 
(1)Specific performance 
(2)Damages for loss of bargain 
(3)Specific performance 
(4)The forfeiture of a deposit, representing fifty percent of the purchase price, as liquidated damages","Answer: 4 Explanation: Option (4) is correct because deposits for real estate transactions are 5-10% of the total purchase price, so a deposit of 50% as liquidated damages will likely not be enforced by the courts since it would not be a reasonable pre-estimate of damages. Option (1) is incorrect because the courts will award specific performance to the seller if damages are considered to be an inadequate remedy. Options (2) and (3) are incorrect because the court will award damages to any party who can prove that he or she has suffered loss as a result of a breach of contract so as to return them to the position they would have been in had the contract been performed as promised."
"Question 390: Which of the following is the British Columbia Financial Services Authority NOT explicitly empowered to investigate under the Real Estate Services Act? 
(1)Wrongful taking or deceptive dealing 
(2)Breaches of the REALTOR Code 
(3)Wrongful taking or deceptive dealing 
(4)Incompetence as a licensee","Answer: 2 Explanation: Option (2) is correct because the Real Estate Services Act does not give the British Columbia Financial Services Authority (BFCSA) the power to investigate breaches of the REALTOR Code. The REALTOR Code is a professional ethical code that has been developed by the Canadian Real Estate Association and is enforced by local real estate boards, not BCFSA. Options (1), (3), and (4) are incorrect because section the Real Estate Services Act empowers BCFSA to conduct an investigation to determine whether a licensee has committed professional misconduct, and wrongful taking or deceptive dealing; contravention of the Act, the Regulations or Rules; and incompetence in performing any activity for which a license is required all amount to professional misconduct under section 35 of the Real Estate Services Act."
"Question 391: A term of the mortgage provides that the full outstanding balance will become due and payable in the event of default by the borrower in making any payment. This term is known as: 
(1)the repayment clause. 
(2)the personal covenant. 
(3)the repayment clause. 
(4)the acceleration clause.","Answer: 4 Explanation: Option (4) is correct because the acceleration clause is a term in the contract which brings the maturity date of the loan forward if the borrower defaults, so that the outstanding balance is immediately due and payable. Option (1) is incorrect because the repayment clause states that the full amount outstanding is due and payable on a fixed date after the loan is made (i.e. it sets the maturity date, which can be brought forward by the acceleration clause in the case of default). Option (2) is incorrect because the personal covenant is the personal contractual promise made by the mortgagor to pay the mortgage money and interest of the mortgage. Option (3) is incorrect because the omnibus clause gives the lender an alternative to accelerating the loan if the borrower defaults."
"Question 392: Which of the following statements is TRUE? 
(1)Taxes always appear as a credit on the seller’s statement of adjustments and as a debit on the buyer’s statement of adjustments. 
(2)Where the licensee acts only for the seller, real estate commission always appears as a debit on the seller’s statement of adjustments and does not appear on the buyer’s statement of adjustments. 
(3)Taxes always appear as a credit on the seller’s statement of adjustments and as a debit on the buyer’s statement of adjustments. 
(4)None of the above","Answer: 2 Explanation: Option (2) is correct because the commission is paid by the seller only, and so it would appear as a debit to the seller (reducing the amount of cash proceeds of sale due to the seller) and the buyer’s statement would not be affected. Because of this, Option (4) is incorrect. Option (1) is incorrect because taxes will appear as a credit on the buyer’s statement of adjustments and a debit on the seller’s statement of adjustments in the case that taxes are to be paid in the future by the buyer. Option (3) is incorrect because, although it is true that conveyancing fees would appear on the buyer’s statement of adjustments as a debit, the fees would not be included in the seller’s statement of adjustments."

(2)The outstanding balance at the end of the term will be less than $1,123,500. 
(3)The quarterly payment will be $49,701. 
(4)The lender has no right to demand payment of the total outstanding balance at any time prior to the end of the contractual term provided the borrower meets all contractual obligations.","Answer: 3 Explanation: Option (3) is false. Individual borrowers, not corporations, have the right, under the terms of the Interest Act, to prepay all of the outstanding balance at any time after five years from the initiation date of the mortgage.

(4)Assuming the standard bylaws have not been amended, the strata council may pass rules with respect to the safety and cleanliness of individually owned strata lots.","Answer: 4 Explanation: Option (4) is correct (false) because the standard bylaws do not allow the strata council to pass rules with respect to the safety and cleanliness of individually owned strata lots – they can only do so with respect to the common property.

(1)Number of shares issued 
(2)Original cost of the property owned by the corporation 
(3)Number of shares issued 
(4)Retained earnings to date","Answer: 3 Explanation: Option (3) is correct because the names of individual shareholders are not included on a corporation’s balance sheet because this could represent anywhere from one shareholder to millions of shareholders. Option (1) is incorrect because the shareholders’ equity section of the balance sheet does list the number of shares issued and outstanding. Option (2) is incorrect because the original cost of property owned by the corporation (i.e., its assets) is listed on the balance sheet.

(1)Viewing a client’s government-issued photo identification during a videoconferencing call 
(2)Matching personal information provided by the client to a Canadian credit file that has been in existence for at least three years 
(3)Viewing a client’s government-issued photo identification during a videoconferencing call 
(4)Referring to information from an offshore financial entity that confirms that the client holds a deposit account with that entity","Answer: 2 Explanation: Option (2) is correct because it correctly describes a method that a licensee can use to identify an individual. Option (1) is incorrect because when using government-issued photo identification to identify an individual, the licensee must either examine the document in person, or virtually through sophisticated software that will analyze its security features. Videoconferencing will not meet this requirement. Option (3) is incorrect because the government-issued photo identification must be valid and current, and an expired driver’s licence, even if it has only been expired for a short period of time, will not meet this requirement. Option (4) is incorrect because an offshore financial entity is not considered a reliable source for the purposes of the dual process method of identification."

(3)The contract is affirmed by the infant after they reach 19 years of age. 
(4)The contract is enforceable against the infant in all of the above situations.","Answer: 4 Explanation: Option (4) is correct (and Options (1), (2), and (3) are incorrect) because section 19(1) of the Infants Act provides that a contract entered into by an infant will be unenforceable against the infant unless another statute provides that the contract is enforceable, the infant affirms the contract after turning 19, the infant performs or partially performs the contract after turning 19, or the infant does not repudiate the contract within one year of turning 19."

(1)warehouses. 
(2)single-family residences. 
(3)warehouses.

Single-family residences are generally not income-generating investment properties, and are more frequently owner occupied. Options (1), (3), (4) are incorrect because the income approach is more often used for warehouses, leasehold interests, and apartment buildings."

(4)apparent authority.","Answer: 4 Explanation: Option (4) is correct because apparent authority results where a reasonable third party would consider, from the conduct or statements of the principal and agent, that the agent did, in fact, possess authority. Option (1) is incorrect because actual authority refers to the authority given to the agent by the principal in their agency agreement and includes express authority, implied authority, and customary authority. Option (2) is incorrect because express authority is the authority created by the terms of the agency contract and does not need to be implied by acts of the parties. Option (3) is incorrect because legal authority is not a recognized category of agency (although the terms of the agency agreement could include giving the agent authority to make legal decisions)."
"Question 401: Who owns the common property of a strata corporation? 
(1)The owner-developer of a strata project, as a trustee for the individual strata lot owners 
(2)The strata corporation 
(3)The owner-developer of a strata project, as a trustee for the individual strata lot owners 
(4)None of the above","Answer: 3 Explanation: Option (3) is correct because each strata owner jointly owns the common property of the strata development, and the Schedule of Unit Entitlement determines each owner’s proportionate, undivided ownership share as a tenant in common of the common property in the strata plan. Option (4) is incorrect for the same reason. Option (1) is incorrect because the owner-developer is not a trustee for the individual strata lot owners. Option (2) is incorrect because, although the strata corporation exercises exclusive control over the common property, it is still owned jointly by the individual strata lot owners."
"Question 402: At the time a transaction is completed, which one of the following items will be the responsibility of the buyer? 
(1)Tax penalty with respect to overdue taxes 
(2)Costs of preparing a first mortgage 
(3)Tax penalty with respect to overdue taxes 
(4)Commission",Answer: 2 Explanation: Option (2) is correct because a borrower is normally charged the costs of preparing and registering a new first mortgage. Option (1) is incorrect because the seller is responsible for the full amount of any penalty; it is not adjusted because only the seller was liable to pay and failed to do so in a timely manner. Option (3) is incorrect because taxes up until the possession date are owed by the seller; the buyer is only responsible for taxes from the possession date until December 31. Option (4) is incorrect because the commission is normally paid by the seller.
"Question 403: Where a licensee intends to purchase property, which of the following details must they disclose to the seller? 
(1)The fact that they hold a real estate licence 
(2)Any details that have been arranged for the resale of the property 
(3)The fact that they hold a real estate licence 
(4)All of the above information must be disclosed.","Answer: 4 Explanation: Option (4) is correct (and Options (1), (2), and (3) are incorrect) because under section 53 of the Rules, where a licensee is acquiring real estate, disclosure must be made to the other party before the agreement is entered into by providing them with the Disclosure of Interest in Trade form, which includes an indication that the licensee is licensed under RESA, the terms under which the real estate is to be resold (where applicable), and the amount of remuneration or other money that is anticipated to be received by the licensee."
"Question 404: When using the cost approach of appraisal to estimate the value of a building that currently contains urea formaldehyde foam insulation (UFFI), insulation should be considered in your calculation as: 
(1)a part of the land value. 
(2)only a deduction for depreciation. 
(3)a part of the land value. 
(4)a component of site value.","Answer: 3 Explanation: Option (3) is correct because when using the cost approach of appraisal to estimate the value of a building that contains urea formaldehyde foam insulation (UFFI), insulation should be considered in your calculation as part of the overall replacement costs and as a deduction for depreciation. Option (3) is incorrect for this reason. Options (1) and (4) are incorrect because insulation would not be a part of the land/site value."
"Question 405: An investor has decided to establish a bank account in order to accumulate sufficient capital at the end of seven years to purchase a boat. If the account pays interest at 3% per annum, compounded annually and the investor makes deposits of $8,000 at the end of each year, how much capital will he have accumulated at the end of 7 years?

"Question 406: A contract between a seller and a buyer whereby the seller agrees to sell its interest in certain property to the buyer for a price payable by instalments and then to convey legal title to the buyer after payment of the purchase price in the manner agreed, is called: 
(1)a mortgage. 
(2)an agreement of purchase and sale. 
(3)a mortgage. 
(4)an agreement for sale.","Answer: 4 Explanation: Option (4) is correct because an agreement for sale is a purchase agreement whereby the purchaser agrees to pay the purchase price of the property (usually with a down payment plus monthly payments of principal and interest) directly to the seller. Option (1) is incorrect because under a mortgage the title is registered to the purchaser and the vendor’s mortgage is registered as a charge, while in an agreement for sale the vendor remains on the title as registered owner and promises to execute a transfer as soon as the final payment is made. Option (2) is incorrect because an agreement of purchase and sale is a contract for the purchase of land which contains the obligations of the vendor and purchaser with respect to the transaction. Option (3) is incorrect because the equity of redemption is the mortgagor’s right to repay the mortgage and regain title even after the contractual date for repayment has passed."
"Question 407: Given a nominal rate of interest of 5%, the greater the frequency of compounding: 
(1)the lower the effective annual rate. 
(2)the higher the rate per compounding period. 
(3)the lower the effective annual rate. 
(4)the lower the payments to the borrower.","Answer: 3 Explanation: Option (3) is correct and can be illustrated by way of example. A loan with an interest rate of 5% compounded annually will yield a $5 return at the end of the year for a $100 investment. If it was a nominal rate of 5%, compounded semi-annually, the yield would be $5.06025 (a 5.06025% effective rate). Therefore, increasing the compounding period increases the yield to the lender. Options (1), (2), and (4) are incorrect for this reason."
"Question 408: The remuneration figures contained in the Disclosure of Expected Remuneration (Payment) form: 
(1)can be disclosed as a percentage or a dollar amount. 
(2)must be expressed as a dollar amount if the remuneration is to be received as money. 
(3)can be disclosed as a percentage or a dollar amount. 
(4)can be expressed in any way that is most transparent to the seller.","Answer: 2 Explanation: Option (2) is correct as remuneration that is to be received as money must be expressed as a dollar amount in the Disclosure of Expected Remuneration (Payment) form. Options (1), (3), and (4) are incorrect for this reason."
"Question 409: Which one of the following BEST describes shareholders’ equity? 
(1)Share capital plus retained earnings 
(2)Retained earnings plus dividends 
(3)Share capital plus retained earnings 
(4)Net income less dividends",Answer: 1 Explanation: Option (1) is correct because the shareholders’ equity section on a corporation’s balance sheet is made up of two accounts: share capital and retained earnings. Options (2) and (3) are incorrect because this section does not include dividends. Option (4) is incorrect because net income is already accounted for within the retained earnings account.
"Question 410: ABC Inc. paid $155,000 for an asset on which the Income Tax Act allows capital cost allowance (CCA). The asset was purchased five years ago and will be disposed at the end of this year. How much CCA will be claimed by ABC Inc. at the end of this year? 
(1)$7,750 
(2)$5,997 
(3)$7,750 
(4)$2,500","Answer: 3 Explanation: Option (3) is correct because according to the capital cost allowance rules set out by the Canada Revenue Agency, in the year an asset is disposed of, no CCA deduction is allowed on that asset. In the case of ABC Inc., no CCA may be claimed at the end of the current year. Options (1), (2), and (4) are therefore incorrect."
"Question 411: Which statute requires that a brokerage keep at least one trust account in a savings institution in British Columbia? 
(1)The Real Estate Services Act 
(2)The British Columbia Property Manager’s Act 
(3)The Real Estate Services Act 
(4)The Bank Act","Answer: 1 Explanation: Option (1) is correct (and Options (2), (3), and (4) are incorrect) because section 25 of the Real Estate Services Act requires a brokerage to maintain one or more interest bearing trust accounts in British Columbia."
"Question 412: A seller refuses to sign a subject removal form to strike out a condition precedent from a contract of purchase and sale. Assuming that the condition was made exclusively for the benefit of the buyer, the agreement is: 
(1)binding. 
(2)unenforceable. 
(3)binding. 
(4)void.","Answer: 1 Explanation: Option (1) is correct because where a condition is for the sole benefit of the buyer, the buyer may waive it and thus the agreement would be binding. Because a binding agreement can be enforced and is not void, Options (2) and (4) are incorrect. Option (3) is incorrect because the condition was made for the benefit of the buyer, so it would only be voidable at the option of the buyer, not the seller."
"Question 413: Before valuing a house, an appraiser should assume that: 
(1)the registered owner is not the ultimate source of data on the property. 
(2)the registered owner has a fee simple interest in the land. 
(3)the registered owner is not the ultimate source of data on the property. 
(4)the property is unencumbered.","Answer: 1 Explanation: Option (1) is correct because an appraisal should not rely on the registered owner as the ultimate source of data on the property. Instead, the appraiser is often expected to perform his or her own research an analysis. An appraiser should not make assumptions represented in Options (2), (3), or (4)."
"Question 414: A borrower has arranged a $159,000 mortgage at j2 = 12% with a 20-year amortization, 5-year term, and monthly payments. If all payments are paid when due, how much principal was paid off during the 5-year term?

(2)The offeror dies or becomes insane before the offeree accepts the offer. 
(3)No time limit is specified in the offer but a reasonable time has passed without acceptance by the offeree. 
(4)The offeror decides to revoke their oral offer and mails a written revocation to the offeree, which the offeree has not yet received.","Answer: 4 Explanation: Option (4) is correct because the revocation of an offer must be actually communicated to be effective (the postal acceptance rule does not apply to revocation). Therefore, the offer is still valid and can be accepted until the revocation reaches the offeree. Options (1), (2), and (3) are incorrect because the offer is released or expired in each of those scenarios."
"Question 416: A mortgage for $300,000 is written at 6.5% per annum, compounded monthly. The mortgage calls for monthly payments rounded to the next higher dollar, a 5-year term, and a 25-year amortization. The mortgage contract permits the borrower to prepay the full amount of the loan at any time subject to the payment of an interest rate differential penalty. At the time of prepayment, the current comparable interest rate is 4.5% per annum, compounded monthly. If the borrower wishes to prepay this loan at the end of the second year (with the 24th payment), calculate the amount of the interest rate differential penalty.

"Question 417: Functional depreciation can be defined as: 
(1)the loss in value caused by an outmoded or inadequate design. 
(2)the loss in value caused by changing market conditions, which reduce demand for the property. 
(3)the loss in value caused by an outmoded or inadequate design. 
(4)a loss in value that can always be corrected economically.","Answer: 1 Explanation: Option (1) is correct because functional depreciation can be defined as the loss in value caused by an outmoded or inadequate design. Options (2), (3), and (4) are incorrect for this reason."
"Question 418: Where an agent, with express authority, enters into a contract with a third party on behalf of their principal and the third party knows they are an agent, who will the law recognize as parties to that contract? 
(1)The agent and the third party 
(2)The agent, the principal, and the third party 
(3)The agent and the third party 
(4)None of the above","Answer: 3 Explanation: Option (3) is correct because an agent is a person authorized to act on behalf of the principal, so that they represent the principal in dealings with third parties. Therefore, while the agent is acting within the scope of his authority as an agent and after having disclosed that he is an agent for the principal, the contract will be between the principal for whom the agent is acting and the third party. Option (4) is incorrect for the same reason. Options (1) and (2) are incorrect because the agent is acting on behalf of the principal as if he were stepping into the principal’s shoes rather than contracting for himself; therefore, the agent is not party to the agreement."
"Question 419: Ownership of land includes not only the surface of the land, but also which of the following options? 
(1)The column of airspace above it insofar as the owner can make effective use of it 
(2)The branches of any of the neighbour’s trees that hang over the owner’s property 
(3)The column of airspace above it insofar as the owner can make effective use of it 
(4)All of the above are included in ownership of land",Answer: 1 Explanation: Option (1) is correct because a landowner owns or has rights in the airspace above his or her property to the extent that he or she can effectively use it. Options (2) and (3) are incorrect (and Option (4) is therefore also incorrect) because the fact that an object has entered the boundaries of your property does not give you ownership rights over it.
"Question 420: Which one of the following is NOT a remedy available for a private nuisance? 
(1)Abatement 
(2)Damages 
(3)Abatement 
(4)Injunction","Answer: 3 Explanation: Option (3) is correct because specific performance involves the court ordering a party to carry out a specific action, which the courts will not grant as a remedy for nuisance – they will only make an order for a party to stop doing a particular act (i.e. an injunction). Options (1), (2), and (4) are each incorrect because injunctions, damages, and abatement are all remedies which are potentially available for a private nuisance."
"Question 421: Question 421 SKIPPED due to format 
(1)Abatement 
(2)Damages 
(3)Abatement

A balance sheet, or statement of financial position, shows all of the company’s assets, liabilities, and the equity of the shareholders at a single point in time. Options (1) and (2) are incorrect because the statement of profit and loss, also known as the income statement, shows the company’s revenues and expenses. Option (4) is incorrect because there is no financial statement known as a corporate statement of holdings."
"Question 422: Where a deposit is paid directly to a seller on account of the purchase price: 
(1)the amount of the deposit will appear only on the buyer’s statement of adjustments. 
(2)the amount of the deposit will appear on both the buyer’s and the seller’s statement of adjustments. 
(3)the amount of the deposit will appear only on the buyer’s statement of adjustments. 
(4)the deposit will not appear on either statement of adjustment.","Answer: 2 Explanation: Option (2) is correct because a deposit which is paid directly to a seller (rather than to the brokerage) will appear as a credit to the buyer and a debit to the seller, because it will reduce the cash proceeds to be received by the seller upon completion. Because of this, Options (1), (3), and (4) are incorrect. Although a deposit which is paid to the buyer’s brokerage will only appear on the buyer’s statement of adjustments and not the seller’s, this is not the case where the deposit is paid directly to a seller."
"Question 423: You have a partially completed appraisal report that you need to fill in. The subject property has 4 bedrooms and 4 bathrooms. The house next door is similar in all respects except for the number of bedrooms and bathrooms. The comparable has a sale price of $281,000, a –$3,200 adjustment for bedrooms, and a +$2,700 adjustment for bathrooms. If the market value of a bedroom is $3,200 and the market value of a bathroom is $2,700, it can be concluded that this comparable has: 
(1)5 bedrooms and 2 bathrooms. 
(2)3 bedrooms and 3 bathrooms. 
(3)5 bedrooms and 2 bathrooms. 
(4)5 bedrooms and 3 bathrooms.","Answer: 4 Explanation: Option (4) is correct because in relation to the subject property, this comparable has one more bedroom and one less bathroom. Options (1), (2), and (3) are therefore incorrect."
"Question 424: Two mortgages requiring constant blended payments are identical in all respects except that one has a five-year term and the other has a two-year term. The monthly payments on the five-year term mortgage would be: 
(1)higher than those required on the two-year term mortgage. 
(2)lower than those required on the two-year term mortgage. 
(3)higher than those required on the two-year term mortgage. 
(4)impossible to compare given the information presented.","Answer: 3 Explanation: Option (3) is correct because the difference in term has no impact on the monthly payments. Since the loan amount, interest rate, and amortization period are all the same, the monthly payments will be the same. Options (1), (2), and (4) are incorrect for this reason."
"Question 425: Which one of the following is NOT a required provision in a lease? 
(1)The amount of rent and method of payment 
(2)The commencement and term of the lease 
(3)The amount of rent and method of payment 
(4)The previous address of the lessee","Answer: 4 Explanation: Option (4) is correct because there is no requirement, statutory or common law, that the previous address of the lessee be included as an essential term of the lease agreement. Options (1), (2), and (3) are incorrect because the Residential Tenancy Act requires the rent and the date on which the tenancy starts to be included in every tenancy agreement, and also requires that the agreement be in writing and signed and dated by both the landlord and tenant."

"Question 427: If there is no listing contract in existence but the agent effects a sale of the principal’s property at the request of the principal, the courts will: 
(1)not imply an undertaking to pay the agent remuneration. 
(2)imply a promise to pay the agent remuneration. 
(3)not imply an undertaking to pay the agent remuneration. 
(4)hold the agent liable for any default of the buyer.","Answer: 2 Explanation: Option (2) is correct because in the case where there is no listing contract but the agent effects a sale of the seller’s property at the request of the seller, the courts can apply the principle of quantum meruit to imply a promise to pay a reasonable amount for the professional services provided. Option (1) is incorrect for the same reason. Option (3) is incorrect because the courts will give a reasonable remuneration based on what the service provided was worth, not just out of pocket expenses. Option (4) is incorrect because, even if there was a listing contract between the agent and the principal in this case, the agent is working on behalf of the seller and so they would not be held liable for the buyer’s default."
"Question 428: Suppose XYZ Ltd. is located in a building that was purchased two years ago for $1,000,000. The building has an economic life of 10 years with no salvage value.

(1)The client must be provided with an option to unsubscribe. 
(2)The licensee may not send email marketing materials without first obtaining consent from the new client. 
(3)The client must be provided with an option to unsubscribe. 
(4)The licensee should ensure that the client’s email address is up to date.","Answer: 3 Explanation: Option (3) is false and is the correct answer. A client must provide consent when being added to a mailing list [Option (2)], but even after consent is obtained, the sender must be provided with a way to request to be removed from the mailing list [Option (1)] and any such requests must be honoured immediately. Option (4) is incorrect because an email database needs to be maintained regularly and if the client’s correct email address is not being used, then they will not receive the messages."
"Question 430: Which of the following options is a current asset on the balance sheet? 
(1)The owner’s initial investment 
(2)Rent payable 
(3)The owner’s initial investment 
(4)Rent receivable","Answer: 4 Explanation: Option (4) is correct because rent receivable is considered a current asset. A current asset is something that the company owns, and will use up within the next year. Option (1) is incorrect because the owner’s initial investment will be listed as owner’s equity. Option (2) is incorrect because rent payable will be listed as a current liability. Option (3) is incorrect because real property will be recorded as a fixed or long-term asset, and will be recorded at its historic cost."
"Question 431: Susan Seller discovered a secret arrangement between her agent and Bella Buyer where Susan’s agent would give some of the commission payable by Susan to her agent directly to Bella. Based on this situation, which of the following statements is TRUE? 
(1)Because there was no detriment to Susan, the agent did not breach any duties owed to her. 
(2)The agent breached her duty to disclose material facts to Susan, but this does not amount to a breach of fiduciary duty. 
(3)Because there was no detriment to Susan, the agent did not breach any duties owed to her. 
(4)The agent’s non-disclosure is a breach of her fiduciary duty to Susan, and as a consequence, the agent may not be entitled to the commission claimed.","Answer: 4 Explanation: Option (4) is correct because the agent’s duty of disclosure includes everything known to the licensee respecting the transaction and is not limited to situations where there is a detriment to the seller. Failure to make full disclosure amounts to a breach of the fiduciary duty and where this duty is breached, the seller may not be required to pay the licensee a commission on closing. Options (1) and (2) are incorrect for the same reason. Option (3) is incorrect because the agent is acting on behalf of the seller, and thus her fiduciary duty is to Susan, not to Bella."

(1)Firewalls 
(2)Passwords 
(3)Firewalls 
(4)Protecting hardware","Answer: 1 Explanation: Option (1) is correct because firewalls are hardware and software boundaries frequently used to prevent unauthorized users from accessing private computers or networks connected to the internet. All data attempting to pass through the firewall is blocked unless it meets a certain criteria of authorization needed to pass through. Options (2), (3), and (4) are therefore incorrect."

(1)the first registered charge holder. 
(2)the last registered charge holder. 
(3)the first registered charge holder. 
(4)not registered.","Answer: 3 Explanation: Option (3) is correct because under the Torrens system in place in British Columbia, all mortgages are registered as charges against the title and the title will continue to show the borrower (mortgagor) as the registered owner, not as a charge holder. Option (1), (2), and (4) are incorrect for the same reason."
"Question 434: Operating expenses for appraisal purposes include: 
(1)income taxes. 
(2)property taxes. 
(3)income taxes. 
(4)capital cost allowance.","Answer: 2 Explanation: Option (2) is correct because property taxes are an expense included in operating expenses for appraisal purposes.

"Question 435: Given that all other factors are identical, the shorter the term of the contract on a bonused, partially amortized mortgage (where the bonus is paid by the borrower): 
(1)the lower the effective interest rate paid by the borrower. 
(2)the higher the effective interest rate paid by the borrower. 
(3)the lower the effective interest rate paid by the borrower. 
(4)the lower the outstanding balance at the term’s end.","Answer: 2 Explanation: Option (2) is correct because all things being equal, a shorter term on a bonused partially amortized loan will result in a higher effective interest rate paid by the borrower. This is because the value of the bonus is paid off over a shorter term, thus increasing the annual cost of borrowing. Options (1), (3), and (4) are incorrect."

(1)Exterior brick veneer 
(2)Interior wood panelling on perimeter walls 
(3)Exterior brick veneer 
(4)Sub-floors","Answer: 2 Explanation: Option (2) is correct because a polyethylene vapour barrier must be used immediately under the interior wood panelling on the perimeter walls of a western platform wood-frame house in order to ensure proper function of the vapour barrier. Options (1), (3), and (4) are incorrect because a polyethylene vapour barrier would not be used under those surfaces."

(1)Anton dies. 
(2)Bentley dies. 
(3)Anton dies. 
(4)all three men die.","Answer: 2 Explanation: Option (2) is correct because an estate pur autre vie ends when the person whose life upon which it is based dies, in this case, Bentley. Option (1) is incorrect because Anton’s interest is dependent on Bentley’s life, not his own. Option (3) is incorrect because Anton’s interest is not terminated when Charles dies, rather, Charles (or his heirs, if Charles dies before Bentley) will receive the interest that Anton currently holds once Bentley dies, ending Anton’s interest.

(2)The company’s profit for the current year that was retained for future investment

(4)The accumulated profits since incorporation used for investing in fixed assets","Answer: 3 Explanation: Option (3) is correct because retained earnings is the company’s total accumulated profits less any dividends paid since incorporation. Option (1) is incorrect because it refers to the net income as shown on the income statement. Option (2) is incorrect because it represents the amount that the retained earnings will increase in a given year if no dividends are paid. Option (4) is incorrect because it refers to how retained earnings may be invested, but is not considered retained earnings."

(1)If Patricia cannot sell her home by December 31, there is no contract and Velma retains the deposit.

(3)If Patricia cannot sell her home by December 31, there is no contract and Velma retains the deposit. 
(4)This requirement may be waived by Patricia on or before December 31.","Answer: 4 Explanation: Option (4) is correct because the party benefiting from the subject clause (in this case, Patricia) may remove the clause by declaring it fulfilled by written notice or by waiving it on or before the specified date for the condition. Option (1) is incorrect because in a standard form contract of purchase and sale, unless each condition is waived or declared fulfilled, the Contract will be terminated and the deposit would be returned (i.e., Velma would not retain the deposit). Option (2) is incorrect because the contract will be cancelled if Patricia does not fulfill the subject clause by selling her home and she does not waive it, so Patricia will not be forced to complete. Option (3) is incorrect because Patricia must waive the requirement on or before the date specified in the clause (December 31) rather than any time before completion."

(1)The mortgage qualifying rate is always based on an additional 2% above the mortgage’s negotiated contract rate. 
(2)The stress test mortgage qualifying rate is also known as the benchmark interest rate. 
(3)The mortgage qualifying rate is always based on an additional 2% above the mortgage’s negotiated contract rate. 
(4)The stress test qualification rules only apply to mortgages from credit unions.","Answer: 2 Explanation: Option (2) is correct because it is true.

Option (3) is incorrect because the Office of the Superintendent of Financial Institutions (OSFI) established the stress test requirements for all new mortgages from federally chartered institutions.

"Question 446: Duress, in law, consists of: 
(1)actual or threatened violence or imprisonment. 
(2)difficulty of performance. 
(3)actual or threatened violence or imprisonment. 
(4)a misrepresentation made knowingly or recklessly, not caring whether it be true or false.","Answer: 1 Explanation: Option (1) is correct because common law duress occurs where a person is forced to enter into a contract against his or her will by the threat of imprisonment either to himself or his family, or the threat of actual physical violence. Option (2) is incorrect because difficulty of performance would arise after a contract was entered into, whereas duress relates to the party being robbed of the free will to enter into the contract. Option (3) is incorrect because undue influence is a separate concept from duress. Although it also relates to the loss of free will to contract, it is as a result of a person in a superior or dominant position in relation to another using their position to induce the other to enter a contract which he or she would not have otherwise made rather than as a result of a threat. Option (4) is incorrect because it describes negligent misrepresentation rather than duress."

(1)January 1-September 20. 
(2)September 20-December 31. 
(3)January 1-September 20. 
(4)July 2-December 31.","Answer: 2 Explanation: Option (2) is correct because where taxes have previously been paid by the seller, the buyer will reimburse them for the portion of the year starting from and including the adjustment date, (i.e., the portion of the year that they have ownership of the property.) In this case, this includes September 20 to December 31. Options (1), (3), and (4) are incorrect for this reason."
"Question 449: The cost approach of appraisal is NOT generally used to value: 
(1)airport hangars. 
(2)vacant lots. 
(3)airport hangars. 
(4)single-family residences.","Answer: 2 Explanation: Option (2) is correct because the cost approach of appraisal is generally used for unique properties that do not have any comparable sales data, relying on a land value estimate from direct comparison, then valuing the improvements on the land with the cost approach. Since vacant land has no improvements the cost approach cannot be used on vacant land. Options (1), (3), and (4) could be valued using the cost approach in certain circumstances."
"Question 450: A gain or reward received by an agent from a third party in connection with their agency relationship with the principal, if it not disclosed to the principal, is known in agency law as: 
(1)a secret profit. 
(2)a taxable gain. 
(3)a secret profit. 
(4)a latent defect.","Answer: 1 Explanation: Option (1) is correct because a gain or reward received by an agent from a third party in connection with his or her agency relationship with the principal, if not disclosed to the principal, is known as a secret profit. Options (2), (3), and (4) are incorrect for this reason."
"Question 451: An agent’s authority can be created retroactively by their principal by an action called: 
(1)rectification. 
(2)ratification. 
(3)rectification. 
(4)revocation.","Answer: 2 Explanation: Option (2) is correct because an agent’s authority can be granted retroactively through ratification where an agent enters into a contract on behalf of the principal that is beyond the agent’s authority, but the principal later consents to be bound by the unauthorized acts of the agent. Option (1) is incorrect because rectification occurs when a court corrects an error made by the parties in a contract (or other document) in order to reflect the parties’ true intentions. Options (3) and (4) are incorrect because rescission and revocation are concepts to do with offer and acceptance in contract law rather than agency."
"Question 452: Which of the following is NOT an essential requirement of a lease? 
(1)The name of the parties 
(2)A description of the premises being leased 
(3)The name of the parties 
(4)The addresses and occupations of the parties","Answer: 4 Explanation: Option (4) is correct because it is not an essential term of the lease (whether commercial or residential) to include the occupations of the parties.

(1)Frank and Joe have formed a binding and enforceable contract. 
(2)Because the requirement of writing contained in section 59 of the Law and Equity Act has not been complied with, a contract has not been formed. 
(3)Frank and Joe have formed a binding and enforceable contract. 
(4)Both (2) and (3) are true.","Answer: 3 Explanation: Option (3) is correct, because in order for a valid contract to be formed, there must be acceptance of an offer. In this case, although both parties have made identical offers, neither offer has been accepted by the other party. Joe has not accepted Frank’s offer because he did not have notice of the offer before sending the email to Frank; rather, he has make a separate offer. Option (1) is incorrect for the same reason. Option (2) is incorrect because section 59 of the Law and Equity Act requires most contracts affecting land to be in writing, and since this is not a contract respecting land, section 59 would not apply. Therefore, Option (4) is also incorrect."
"Question 454: The Law and Equity Act contains provisions for the unilateral waiver by a party of a condition precedent. Which one of the following is NOT one of the requirements? 
(1)The condition precedent has been satisfied. 
(2)The condition precedent benefits only that party to the contract. 
(3)The condition precedent has been satisfied. 
(4)Where a time is stipulated for fulfillment of the condition precedent, the waiver is made before the time stipulated.","Answer: 1 Explanation: Option (1) is correct because satisfying the condition precedent is not a requirement for waiver under the Law and Equity Act. Options (2), (3), and (4) are incorrect because section 54 of the Law and Equity Act requires that, in order to waive a condition precedent, the condition precedent must benefit only the party waiving it, the contract must be capable of being performed without fulfillment of the condition precedent, and the waiver must be made before the time stipulated for the condition’s fulfillment (or within a reasonable time if not specified)."

(1)Revocation 
(2)Rectification 
(3)Revocation 
(4)None of the above",Answer: 1 Explanation: Option (1) is correct because revocation refers to the cancellation of an offer communicated by the offeror to the offeree prior to acceptance. Option (2) is incorrect because rectification occurs when a court corrects an error made by the parties in the contract (or other document) in order to reflect the parties’ true intentions. Option (3) is incorrect because rescission refers to the cancellation of a contract. Option (4) is incorrect because Option (1) is correct.
"Question 456: When borrowers increase their maximum allowable loan by accepting a shorter term and a lower interest rate, the borrowers have: 
(1)an increased degree of risk regarding changes in the interest rate over time. 
(2)the security of never having to incur another set of transaction costs (legal, appraisal) when arranging a new loan with another lender. 
(3)an increased degree of risk regarding changes in the interest rate over time. 
(4)committed to paying more interest during the shorter term loan than the longer term loan.","Answer: 1 Explanation: Option (1) is correct because if borrower agrees to a shorter term in order to increase the maximum allowable loan, they are exposing themselves to greater risk of change in interest rates. The borrower may have to refinance the loan at a higher interest rate in the future, which may cause financial distress to the borrower. Option (2) is incorrect because a a borrower, with a higher maximum allowable loan, may still opt to arrange a new loan with another lender in the future. Option (3) is incorrect because a loan with shorter term and higher maximum allowable loan would expose the borrower to a greater risk of change in interest rates. Option (4) is incorrect because the lower interest rate would mean less interest is paid."
"Question 457: Which of the following statements regarding financial covenants of the mortgagor (borrower) is FALSE? 
(1)The three main financial obligations of the borrower in addition to repayment of the loan amount include payment of property taxes, property insurance, and property maintenance. 
(2)Lenders always make the property tax payments for the borrower to ensure that the property taxes do not fall into arrears. 
(3)The three main financial obligations of the borrower in addition to repayment of the loan amount include payment of property taxes, property insurance, and property maintenance. 
(4)The borrower should maintain the property in a manner that will preserve the value of the security in order to reduce the capital risk.","Answer: 2 Explanation: Option (2) is false. Many, but not all lenders, will set up a separate tax account that the borrower will pay into every periodic payment. This provides security to the lender that their mortgage is the highest priority charge, as well as relieves the borrower from having to make a lump sum payment for property taxes. This strategy requires additional administration by the lender, so typically smaller or private lenders will leave the property tax payments to the borrower. Option (1) is incorrect because borrowers have the obligation to include payment of property taxes, insurance, and maintenance. Option (3) is incorrect because there should be a covenant included in the mortgage loan agreement to insure against fire and other hazards for the property. Option (4) is incorrect because borrowers should be maintaining the property condition as to not reduce the value of the property. This is necessary to reduce capital risk."
"Question 458: Mary and John own a piece of real property as joint tenants. Which of the following is TRUE? 
(1)Mary cannot sell or mortgage her interest without John’s consent. 
(2)Mary and John must each have an undivided interest in the whole of the property. 
(3)Mary cannot sell or mortgage her interest without John’s consent. 
(4)All of the above","Answer: 2 Explanation: Option (2) is correct because in a joint tenancy, each co-owner owns an undivided interest in the whole of the estate. Option (1) is incorrect, because, Mary may still sell or mortgage her interest without John’s consent as a joint tenant (although doing so will convert the co-ownership to a tenancy in common by severing the unity of title). Option (3) is incorrect because, although married people or people in close relationships often use joint tenancies for tax planning purposes, there is no requirement for married couples who are co-owners of a property to register as joint tenants in, and they are free to co-own as tenants in common if they prefer to do so."
"Question 459: With respect to commercial tenancies, the covenant of quiet enjoyment is BEST described as which of the following? 
(1)An implied covenant that the landlord will refrain and will cause others to refrain from making noise such that it would interfere with the conduct of the tenant’s business 
(2)An assurance that the tenant will conduct their business in such a manner as to obey all noise bylaws 
(3)An implied covenant that the landlord will refrain and will cause others to refrain from making noise such that it would interfere with the conduct of the tenant’s business 
(4)An assurance to the tenant against the consequences of a defective title involving the landlord or those lawfully claiming under the landlord","Answer: 4 Explanation: Option (4) is correct because quiet enjoyment is an assurance to the tenant against the consequences of a defective title, i.e., it assures the tenant of the use and enjoyment of the premises for all usual purposes without physical interference or unreasonable disturbance from the landlord. Option (1) is incorrect because the implied covenant of quiet enjoyment does not concern noise that interferes specifically with the tenant’s business. Option (2) is incorrect because the implied covenant of quiet enjoyment is an implied promise given by the landlord to the tenant, and does not restrict the tenant’s own conduct on the property. Option (3) is incorrect because the implied covenant of quiet enjoyment does not concern the premise’s fitness for habitation."
"Question 460: Which of the following is NOT a reason why an investor would use borrowed funds instead of an all cash offer for a real estate investment?

(4)To invest the borrowed funds at a lower rate of interest than the borrowing rate","Answer: 4 Explanation: Option (4) is the correct answer; an investor will only use borrowed funds if he or she is able to invest the borrowed funds at a higher rate (not a lower rate) of interest than the borrowing rate. Options (1), (2), and (3) are all reasons to use borrowed funds in a real estate investment."
"Question 461: Which of the following statements pertaining to British Columbia’s Electronic Transactions Act is TRUE? 
(1)An offer or acceptance communicated through electronic means is never legally binding. 
(2)Listing agreements are not covered by the Electronic Transactions Act. 
(3)An offer or acceptance communicated through electronic means is never legally binding. 
(4)When a British Columbia statute references a written document, it does not exclude electronic documents merely because they are in electronic form.","Answer: 4 Explanation: Option (4) is true and is the correct answer: when a BC statute makes references to “written” documents or signatures, it will not exclude electronic documents and signatures merely because they are in electronic form. Option (1) is false because a legally binding contract may be formed by an offer or acceptance communicated through electronic means, but only if the parties so intend. Option (2) is false because certain documents that relate to land or land transactions, including listing agreements, are covered by the Act. Option (3) is false because documents that create or transfer interest in land and that require registration to be effective against third parties are specifically excluded from the Act."

"Question 463: In a binding contract, a condition precedent can BEST be described as: 
(1)a “subject to” clause that gives a party sole discretion over whether or not to proceed with a sale. 
(2)a condition or event, the occurrence of which will discharge the principal obligations of a party to the contract. 
(3)a “subject to” clause that gives a party sole discretion over whether or not to proceed with a sale. 
(4)a condition that must occur before a party is liable to perform their principal obligations under the contract.","Answer: 4 Explanation: Option (4) is correct because a condition precedent is the legal term for a “subject to” clause. It calls for the happening of some event or the performance of some act before the contract is binding upon the parties. Option (1) is incorrect because a binding contract does not exist when a “subject to” clause gives one party sole discretion over whether or not to proceed with a sale. When a subject clause is wholly subjective, the court may view the arrangement, in law, as nothing more than an offer. Option (2) is incorrect because it describes a condition subsequent, not a condition precedent. While a condition subsequent is an event that will discharge the principal obligations of a party to the contract, a condition precedent is an event that must occur before the parties are bound to the contract. Option (3) is incorrect because it provides an example of a condition subsequent."

(1)Mortgage of the equity of redemption 
(2)Agreement to execute a legal mortgage 
(3)Mortgage of the equity of redemption 
(4)All of the above","Answer: 4 Explanation: Option (4) is correct because a mortgage of the equity of redemption, an agreement to execute a legal mortgage, and a mortgage by way of deposit of the duplicate certificate of title are all examples of ways to create equitable mortgages. A mortgage of the equity of redemption is a mortgage of the equitable interest in the land that the borrower retains after granting a legal mortgage. An agreement to grant a mortgage in the future is recognized as a present equitable mortgage. A mortgage by way of deposit of the duplicate certificate of title occurs when a bank requires the duplicate certificate as collateral security for a demand loan."

(2)the unit of subdivided land is called a subdivision unit. 
(3)the Real Estate Development Marketing Act has no jurisdiction.

(3)A custom-designed home containing an elevator and several ramps is sold by Mr. Smith to his nephew, a person with paraplegia. 
(4)ABC Corporation sold its office building to its subsidiary company as a part of a corporate restructuring.",Answer: 2 Explanation: Option (2) is the best evidence of market value because of the similarity and recent nature of the sale of the homes. Option (1) is incorrect because the subject property has unique characteristics that was sold to a special purchaser. Option (3) is incorrect because the urgency of Miss Jones’ sale will likely have an unpredictable influence on the sale price. Option (4) is incorrect because this is an example of a sale between related parties (a special relationship) where the sale price may be discounted to less than market value.

(2)The condition of the premises 
(3)Risks willingly accepted by a person as their own risks

"Question 471: The selling price of a property is $175,000. The buyer has applied to a lender for mortgage funds and been told that the maximum loan he can obtain is $122,500. The lender’s appraiser feels that a long-term conservative estimate of the property’s value is $153,125. Which one of the following statements is TRUE? 
(1)The lending value of this property is $122,500. 
(2)The lending value of this property is $175,000. 
(3)The lending value of this property is $122,500. 
(4)The loan-to-value ratio on this loan is 80%.","Answer: 4 Explanation: From the information given, calculate the loan-to-value ratio. This will be the maximum loan divided by the lending value. $122,500 ÷ $153,125 = 0.8 Option (4) is true; therefore, Option (3) must be false. The lending value of the property is what the appraiser estimates the property value to be. In this case, the lending value is $153,125. Therefore, Options (1) and (2) are false."
"Question 472: Sally contracted to purchase sewing machines wholesale at $100.00 each, with a delivery date of November 30. The wholesaler did not deliver the machines until December 31. Sally had a buyer on November 30 willing to pay $250 each for the machines but by December 31 the value had dropped to only $75.00 each. Which is Sally’s BEST remedy against the wholesaler? 
(1)Quantum meruit 
(2)Specific performance 
(3)Quantum meruit 
(4)Injunction","Answer: 3 Explanation: Option (3) is correct because a damage award would put Sally in the position she would have been in if the contract had been performed as promised, so she would be able to recover the money she lost from the value of the sewing machines dropping as a result of the wholesaler’s breach. Option (1) is incorrect because quantum meruit would only be awarded when the price was not fixed in the contract (and so the court implies a promise to pay a reasonable sum). In this case, the price was stipulated in the contract. Options (2) and (4) are incorrect because the court will refuse to grant equitable remedies (such as specific performance and injunction) when damages are an adequate remedy, as they are in this case."

"Question 474: An individual is planning to purchase a property that has a list price of $69,000. The proposed purchase price will be $67,000 and the lender will apply a lending value of $66,000. How large will the down payment be if the lender insists on a maximum loan-to-value ratio of 80%? 
(1)$14,200 
(2)$16,500 
(3)$14,200 
(4)$52,800","Answer: 1 Explanation: Max loan = Lending value × Loan-to-value Max loan = $66,000 × 0.80 Max loan = $52,800 This is the amount of their mortgage. The question asks for the down payment. If the purchase price is $67,000, and the mortgage is $52,800, then the down payment is equal to the difference of $14,200 ($67,000  $52,800)."
"Question 475: Where a buyer makes an offer to purchase land, and does NOT pay a deposit: 
(1)acceptance by the seller will not form a contract. 
(2)the licensee should personally pay $1.00 of their own money into the brokerage’s trust account. 
(3)acceptance by the seller will not form a contract. 
(4)the “offer” is actually just an invitation to treat.","Answer: 3 Explanation: Option (3) is correct because a contract is formed where there is offer, acceptance, and consideration. In the case of a contract to purchase land, the consideration is the promise to convey title to the purchaser in exchange for the purchase price – the deposit is not required as consideration in order for a valid contract to be formed. Option (1) is incorrect for the same reason. Option (2) is incorrect because there is no requirement for the licensee to pay his or her own money into the brokerage’s trust account where a buyer makes an offer to purchase land without a deposit. Option (4) is incorrect because the offer is treated as an offer so long as it is capable of being unequivocally accepted, regardless of whether or not a deposit is paid."
"Question 476: In addition to carrying out the functions of a trading services representative, a validly licensed representative is entitled to:

(2)be the managing broker of their own proprietorship. 
(3)carry out trading services for an unlicensed real estate brokerage. 
(4)do none of the above.","Answer: 4 Explanation: Option (4) is correct because, under the Real Estate Services Act, a licensed representative is not entitled to carry out trading services for an unlicensed brokerage, to be the managing broker of their own proprietorship, or to carry out trading services without being employed by a brokerage."
"Question 477: Which of the following statements about Duplicate Certificates of Title is TRUE? 
(1)Duplicate certificates of title cannot be issued if the property is subject to a mortgage. 
(2)Certain documents, including easements and builders liens, cannot be registered if a duplicate certificate of title has been taken out of the Land Title Office. 
(3)Duplicate certificates of title cannot be issued if the property is subject to a mortgage. 
(4)The deposit of a duplicate title is considered to be the most preferable measure of security that a borrower can provide to a lender because it completely prevents the conveyance of a property.","Answer: 1 Explanation: Option (1) is correct because duplicate certificates of title cannot be issued if title is subject to a mortgage or an agreement for sale. Option (2) is incorrect because while transfers, mortgages, and long-term leases cannot be registered if a duplicate title is out of the land title office, some specific documents, including easements and builders liens, can still be registered. Option (3) is incorrect because a duplicate title will only be issued upon a written request of the registered owner.

"Question 478: A Court has power to re-open a mortgage transaction where, having regard to the risk and to all the circumstances, it is of the opinion that the cost of borrowing is excessive or harsh and unconscionable. In which one of the following statutes is this power contained? 
(1)Interest Act 
(2)Mortgage Brokers Act 
(3)Interest Act 
(4)Business Practices and Consumer Protection Act","Answer: 4 Explanation: Option (4) is correct because the Business Practices and Consumer Protection Act allows the court to intervene and effectively rewrite the transaction where it considers the cost of the loan to be excessive or the transaction is harsh and unconscionable. Options (1), (2), and (3) are incorrect because the Interest Act, the Mortgage Brokers Act, and the Real Estate Services Act do not confer this power on the courts."

(1)Paula should be given a credit for the estimated taxes between May 1 and December 31. 
(2)Vince should be charged the estimated taxes from January 1 to April 30. 
(3)Paula should be given a credit for the estimated taxes between May 1 and December 31. 
(4)The taxes will appear as a debit on Paula’s statement of adjustment and a credit on Vince’s statement of adjustment.","Answer: 2 Explanation: Option (2) is correct because in the case that taxes are to be paid in the future by the buyer, the seller’s share from January 1 to the adjustment date will be a debit on the seller’s statement of adjustments and will reduce the cash proceeds due to him. Option (1) is incorrect because Paula should be given a credit for the estimated taxes between January 1 and April 30 (i.e., the time that Vince owned the property), not from May 1 to December 31. Option (3) is incorrect because of the amount of taxes is not yet known, it will be calculated based on estimates. Option (4) is incorrect because the taxes will appear as a credit on Paula’s statement and a debit on Vince’s statement."

(2)A licensee must act with reasonable care and skill to both clients and non-clients. 
(3)A licensee must always act in the best interests of both their clients and non-clients. 
(4)A licensee who breaches an ethical duty to a client can still be acting ethically.","Answer: 2 Explanation: Option (2) is correct because licensees owe a duty to act with reasonable care and skill to all parties, including both clients and non-clients. Option (1) is incorrect because a licensee must act in the best interests of their client in a transaction. They do not have a duty to act in the best interests of non-clients.

"Question 484: Marissa owns a 45-year-old apartment building. All six suites are rented out at below-market rents and the current leases are not up for renewal for another two years. The apartment building is situated in a block in which all of the other apartment buildings have been torn down and replaced with office buildings. In addition, the apartment is situated on land zoned for commercial purposes. Which of the following statements is TRUE about the state of Marissa’s investment? 
(1)Marissa’s apartment is not “ripe for re-development”. 
(2)The tenants’ rents will now increase. 
(3)Marissa’s apartment is not “ripe for re-development”. 
(4)Marissa’s apartment is currently at highest and best use.","Answer: 3 Explanation: Option (3) is true because the apartment is in an area that is zoned for commercial use and surrounding developments are all office buildings. Given this, the apartment possesses latent value. Therefore, Option (1) is incorrect as the property is “ripe for re-development”. Option (2) is incorrect because the tenants’ rent cannot increase until the lease renewal in two years. Option (4) is incorrect because the apartment is not at its highest and best use if it possesses latent value."
"Question 485: Which of the following statements comparing cooperatives and condominiums is TRUE? 
(1)Both condominiums and cooperatives are created by filing a plan in the land title office. 
(2)Buyers of both condominiums and cooperatives acquire a fee simple interest in the real property on which the purchased unit is situated. 
(3)Both condominiums and cooperatives are created by filing a plan in the land title office. 
(4)Both owners of condominiums and owners of cooperatives are equally free to sell their units to whomever they wish.","Answer: 3 Explanation: Option (3) is correct because, since the cooperative owner is a tenant of the cooperative corporation and they do not own an estate in land, financing of a cooperative purchase may be more difficult as a buyer can only grant the lender a security interest in his or her shares under the Personal Property Security Act and, if not prohibited by the corporation, a mortgage of his or her leasehold interest. Banks and lending institutions are less willing to lend on this form of security. Option (1) is incorrect because, while a fee simple strata property is created by a strata plan which is filed in the land title office, a cooperative is created by the incorporation of a company or a cooperative association. Option (2) is incorrect because cooperative ownership does not bestow an individual fee simple title to the cooperative owner’s unit; rather, the owner in a cooperative possesses shares in a non-profit corporation which in turn holds title to the land. Option (4) is incorrect because strata lot owners are generally not restricted in any way as to whom he/she wishes to sell the strata lot to, whereas a cooperative owner typically must have the buyer approved by the cooperative association’s board of directors."

(2)It is an accounting concept that attempts to allocate the cost of an asset over its useful life. 
(3)It is another name for capital cost allowance. 
(4)It is never permitted on a single-family residence.",Answer: 2 Explanation: Option (2) is correct; depreciation expense is an attempt to allocate the cost of the asset over its useful life. Option (1) is incorrect; depreciation expense is not another name for capital cost allowance (CCA) because CCA is a method of calculating depreciation for income tax purposes. Option (3) is incorrect; land is not considered to be a depreciable asset thus depreciation expense is never taken on land.

(1)Tax law 
(2)Criminal law 
(3)Tax law 
(4)Constitutional law","Answer: 3 Explanation: Option (3) is correct because agency law is concerned with matters between two (or more) individuals, and so it would fall within the body of private law rather than public law.

(1)Increase the capitalization rate 
(2)Deduct the amount of the repair in the year it is expected to be incurred 
(3)Increase the capitalization rate 
(4)Reduce the eventual sale price of the property to reflect depreciation","Answer: 3 Explanation: Option (3) is correct because when using the income approach, an appropriate annual allowance or reserve should be made to cover the total cost of periodic repairs. For example, to cover the cost of painting every three years, one-third of the total painting cost could be allocated as an expense each year. Options (1), (2), and (4) are therefore incorrect."

(3)Beneficial owners are liable only for the amount committed to the purchase of the trust units.

(3)Newsletters should ideally be sent once per day. 
(4)Newsletters should include an option for subscribers to opt out of receiving future communications.","Answer: 4 Explanation: Option (4) is correct because it is true. Option (1) is incorrect because newsletters should not be sent more frequently than once a week. Option (2) is incorrect because a newsletter should provide compelling content, such as market news, local events, real estate-related tips, and information on new housing developments. Option (3) is incorrect because even though pictures can enhance the look of the newsletter, one must remember to keep the file size of the newsletter small so the message is easily received."

(1)for the seller. 
(2)for the buyer. 
(3)for the seller.

"Question 497: Which of the following statements about the law in British Columbia governing occupiers’ liability is FALSE? 
(1)Under the statute, there can be more than one occupier of land at the same time. 
(2)An occupier’s liability does not extend to risks willingly assumed by a visitor at their own risks. 
(3)Under the statute, there can be more than one occupier of land at the same time. 
(4)The language of the Occupiers Liability Act would probably allow for the imposition of a lesser standard of care to be owed to a trespasser than to a person with permission to be on the premises.","Answer: 3 Explanation: Option (3) is correct because the Occupiers Liability Act (OLA) has removed the common law distinction between different types of visitors. Option (1) is incorrect because section 1 of the OLA specifies that there may be more than one occupier of the same premises. Option (2) is incorrect because section 3 of the OLA states that an occupier has no duty of care in respect of risks willingly assumed by a visitor, other than a duty not to create a danger with intent to do harm to the person or damage to the person’s property, or to act with reckless disregard to the safety of the person or the integrity of the person’s property. Option (4) is incorrect because the legislation specifies that the duty of care imposed on an occupier is to take such care as is reasonable in the circumstances, so it is likely that the standard owed in the circumstances of someone trespassing on the property would be lower than that owed to an invited guest."
"Question 498: You have a partially completed appraisal report that you need to fill in. The house next door to the subject property is similar in all respects except for the number of bedrooms and square footage. This 2,300 square foot comparable sold for $250,000, has 4 bedrooms, and was adjusted +$4,200 for bedrooms and +$15,000 for square footage. If the market value of a bedroom is $4,200 and above a 1,900 sq. ft. benchmark, each 100 sq. ft. is worth $5,000, it can be concluded that the subject property has: 
(1)5 bedrooms and 2,300 square feet. 
(2)4 bedrooms and 2,000 square feet. 
(3)5 bedrooms and 2,300 square feet. 
(4)5 bedrooms and 2,600 square feet.","Answer: 4 Explanation: Option (4) is correct because the square foot adjustment for the property is +$15,000. We know that each additional 100 square feet is worth $5,000, so $15,000 ÷ $5,000 = 300 sq ft bigger than the comparable property. Therefore, the total square footage of the subject property is 2,300 + 300 = 2,600. Since the comparable has 4 bedrooms and was adjusted +$4,200, the comparable has one more bedroom than the subject (5 bedrooms in subject). Options (1), (2), and (3) are therefore incorrect."

(1)The legality of secondary suites 
(2)The regulation of off-street parking and loading 
(3)The legality of secondary suites 
(4)The regulation of short term rental accommodations","Answer: 3 Explanation: Option (3) is correct because the development and operation of airports is an exclusively federal matter.

"Question 500: Which one of the following is NOT a provision of the Interest Act? 
(1)No interest rate higher than 25% shall be provided for in a mortgage document. 
(2)Where a mortgage requires blended payments of principal and interest, the mortgage document must contain a statement of the interest rate calculated “yearly or half-yearly not in advance”. 
(3)No interest rate higher than 25% shall be provided for in a mortgage document. 
(4)The interest rate on arrears under a mortgage may not exceed the rate payable on the principal monies not in arrears.","Answer: 1 Explanation: Option (1) is correct because the Interest Act imposes no limit on the rate of interest which can be charged in a mortgage transaction (however, a rate of interest can be challenged under other legislation, such as the Criminal Code). Option (2) is incorrect because section 6 of the Interest Act requires that, where a mortgage requires blended payments, the mortgage document must contain a statement of the interest rate calculated either “yearly or half-yearly not in advance.” Option (3) is incorrect because under section 3 of the Interest Act, if a document requires interest to be paid but the rate is not set out, then the rate allocated by law is 5% per annum.

(3)It refers to the fact that the offer is only open for a stipulated time. 
(4)It refers to the length of time the other party has to remove a condition precedent once the clause is invoked.","Answer: 4 Explanation: Option (4) is correct because a “time clause” or “72 hour clause” is a clause contained in a contract for purchase or resale of land which allows a seller to invoke a time period in which a condition precedent must be removed. If invoked, failure to remove the condition precedent within the time period would result in termination of the contract. Option (1) is incorrect because a time clause does not, in and of itself, mean that the offer is only open for a stipulated time period. Rather, the right to invoke a time clause arises only where a seller receives a subsequent offer after entering the original contract of purchase and sale. Option (2) is incorrect because this is a right given to the seller only. Option (3) is incorrect because time clauses relate to conditions precedent, not conditions subsequent."
"Question 502: Which of the following statements regarding trespass is TRUE? 
(1)Trespass is actionable only upon proof of damage. 
(2)Trespass is actionable per se. 
(3)Trespass is actionable only upon proof of damage. 
(4)Trespass is actionable only within 30 days of the trespass.","Answer: 2 Explanation: Option (2) is correct because trespass is actionable per se, meaning that no actual damage needs to be proven in order for an occupier to sue in trespass. Option (1) is incorrect for the same reason. Option (3) is incorrect because trespass is actionable. Option (4) is incorrect because there is no 30 day limit for bringing an action in trespass."
"Question 503: The market value of a vacant site can be determined using: 
(1)the cost approach of appraisal. 
(2)the comparative approach of appraisal. 
(3)the cost approach of appraisal. 
(4)the capitalization approach of appraisal.","Answer: 2 Explanation: Option (2) is correct because a vacant site can only be valued using the comparative approach of appraisal. Options (1), (3), and (4) are therefore incorrect."

"Question 505: A “real estate service” under the Real Estate Services Act includes: 
(1)finding a party to acquire real estate. 
(2)collecting rents or security deposits for the use of real estate. 
(3)finding a party to acquire real estate. 
(4)all of the above.",Answer: 4 Explanation: Option (4) is correct because “real estate services” is defined in the Real Estate Services Act to include: (a) rental property management services; (b) strata management services; and (c) trading services. Finding a party to acquire real estate and advising on the appropriate price for real estate are both “trading services” under the Real Estate Services Act. Collecting rents or security deposits for the use of real estate is a “rental property management service” according to the Real Estate Services Act.

"Question 507: Mr. Smith has contracted to sell his house to Mr. Jones for $200,000. Mr. Jones has paid a deposit of $15,000, the balance in cash. Conveyancing fees are $350, taxes were prepaid by the seller, totalling $800 net for the period of July 1 to December 31, and the commission is 5%.

(1)Land 
(2)Rents receivable 
(3)Land 
(4)Accounts payable","Answer: 2 Explanation: Option (2) is correct because rents receivable is the only account listed that will be classified as a current asset. A current asset is something that the company owns, that will be used up within the next year. The rent receivable account is expected to be collected within the next year. Options (1) and (3) are incorrect because land and real property are classified as fixed- or long-term assets. Option (4) is incorrect because accounts payable is classified as a current liability."
"Question 509: Bobby Buyer purchased a home in an area with landslide risks; however, at the time of purchase, Bobby’s licensee did not make any inquiries about landslide risks in the area. Three months after Bobby’s purchase, a landslide occurred three lots away from his property. There is no physical damage to Bobby’s property, but the value of the property decreased significantly. Upon a brief investigation, Bobby discovered that his neighbouring property had previously been the subject of a landslide and that there were public government reports about it. Bobby has started a claim in negligence for economic loss against his licensee for not investigating and alerting him of any landslide risks. Which of the following statements is TRUE? 
(1)Bobby will have difficulty proving that his licensee owed him a duty of care because it is not reasonably foreseeable that his licensee’s actions in the course of the sale would affect Bobby. 
(2)When assessing the standard of care, a court will need to determine whether a reasonable buyer’s agent would have made inquiries as to the landslide risk relating to the property. 
(3)Bobby will have difficulty proving that his licensee owed him a duty of care because it is not reasonably foreseeable that his licensee’s actions in the course of the sale would affect Bobby. 
(4)All of the above statements are true.","Answer: 2 Explanation: Option (2) is correct because the standard of care expected of a licensee is based on what a reasonable licensee ought to have done in all the circumstances. In this situation, a reasonable buyer’s agent would have made inquiries as to the landslide risk relating to the property given that the area was publicly known for landslide risks. Option (1) is incorrect because it is reasonably foreseeable that the actions or inactions of licensees will affect their clients. Option (3) is incorrect because negligence law may also provide compensation for non-physical damages such as economic losses. Option (4) is incorrect because Options (1) and (3) are incorrect."
"Question 510: An option to purchase the mortgaged property given by the mortgagor to the mortgagee at the time the mortgage is negotiated is: 
(1)enforceable if the mortgagor has independent legal advice. 
(2)void. 
(3)enforceable if the mortgagor has independent legal advice. 
(4)called the equity of redemption.","Answer: 2 Explanation: Option (2) is correct because there is a fundamental principle of mortgage law which prohibits “clogging” on “the equity of redemption”. The equity of redemption refers to a borrower’s right to repay the mortgage and, upon doing so, to redeem his or her legal title to the property free of all encumbrances. In other words, a borrower (or the mortgagor) cannot be prevented by the terms of the mortgage from eventually redeeming his or her property free from the conditions contained in the mortgage. An option to purchase a mortgaged property given by the mortgagor (the borrower) to the mortgagee (the lender) at the time the mortgage is negotiated, if exercised, would prevent the mortgagor from redeeming his or her property upon repayment, and is therefore void. Option (1) is incorrect because the prohibition against clogging does not disappear even where the mortgagor has independent legal advice. Option (3) is incorrect because a void option cannot be enforceable in any case. Option (4) is incorrect because the equity of redemption refers to a mortgagor’s right to repay the mortgage, and is not a term for an option to repurchase a mortgaged property."
"Question 511: All other things being equal, shortening the contractual term on a constant level payment mortgage always has the effect of: 
(1)increasing the size of the periodic payments required to fully amortize the loan. 
(2)increasing the size of the outstanding balance payment due at the end of the term. 
(3)increasing the size of the periodic payments required to fully amortize the loan. 
(4)increasing the payment frequency.","Answer: 2 Explanation: Option (2) is correct because if the term of a constant level payment mortgage is shortened, the result will be a higher outstanding balance at the end of the term. This occurs because a shorter term has fewer payments that will pay down principal and reduce the outstanding balance with each payment. Option (1) is incorrect because the size of periodic payments is not increased when the contractual term in shortened in a constant level payment mortgage. Option (3) is incorrect because the interest rate is not affected. Option (4) is incorrect because the payment frequency will not change."
"Question 512: If you consider that the value shown on your assessment notice is too high, you can make a formal complaint to the: 
(1)municipal court. 
(2)Court of Appeal. 
(3)municipal court. 
(4)Property Assessment Review Panel.","Answer: 4 Explanation: Option (4) is correct because any person may, under the Assessment Act, make a complaint against an entry in an assessment roll on the grounds that the property has been valued at too high or too low an amount. Any initial appeal against a real property assessment must be submitted to the Property Assessment Review Panel for initial adjudication. Option (1) is incorrect because there are no “municipal courts” to deal with property assessment complaints. Option (2) is incorrect because the Court of Appeal will not hear formal complaints regarding assessment notices. The Court of Appeal will only review issues of law arising from lower court decisions. Option (3) is incorrect because, while the Property Assessment Appeal Board may order the Assessment Commissioner to carry out a reassessment, formal complaints are not made to the Commissioner."
"Question 513: Charlie enters into a fixed term tenancy agreement with Lucy for the rental of a suite during the school year. The agreement is for eight months beginning on September 1, 2018. The agreement does not provide that Charlie must vacate the rental unit when the term expires. In April, Charlie finds a summer job and decides to remain in the suite after the original lease expires. He pays Lucy one month’s rent on May 1, 2019, which she accepts. No new agreement is entered into. Two days later, Lucy learns that her brother, Linus, has been transferred back to Vancouver and is expected to arrive at the end of the month with his new wife, Sally. Linus has indicated that he wishes to live in the suite now occupied by Charlie. Which of the following statements is TRUE? 
(1)Under the termination provisions of the Residential Tenancy Act, Lucy can give Charlie notice of the end of the tenancy agreement since she intends, in good faith, for her brother to occupy the premises. 
(2)Lucy just has to wait until the end of May, and can evict Charlie at any time after that, since the original fixed term lease has expired and there is no new tenancy agreement. 
(3)Under the termination provisions of the Residential Tenancy Act, Lucy can give Charlie notice of the end of the tenancy agreement since she intends, in good faith, for her brother to occupy the premises. 
(4)If Linus decides to purchase the suite and plans to move in right away, Lucy can give at least one month notice to end the tenancy.","Answer: 3 Explanation: Option (3) is correct because under the Residential Tenancy Act, when a fixed term residential tenancy expires and the agreement does not provide that the tenant will vacate the rental unit when the term expires, the landlord and the tenant are presumed to have renewed the original agreement as a month-to-month tenancy. Section 49 of the Residential Tenancy Act allows a landlord to terminate a tenancy agreement where the landlord enters into a good faith agreement to sell the rental unit and the purchaser intends to occupy that unit, provided that each of the conditions laid out in Option (3) are met. If the purchaser does not occupy the unit as intended for at least six months, the purchaser must pay the tenant an amount equivalent to 12 months’ rent. Option (1) is incorrect because a landlord cannot terminate a tenancy agreement to allow his or her sibling to occupy the rental unit without further justification. There is a provision for a “close family member” but siblings do not fall under that category. Option (2) is incorrect because, as previously mentioned, Lucy and Linus are presumed to have renewed the original agreement as a month-to-month tenancy. In order to end the tenancy, Lucy must be able to rely on a provision in the Residential Tenancy Act which allows her to do so. Unfortunately, in Lucy’s situation, Charlie is her brother and not a “close family member”. Even if Charlie was a “close family member”, Lucy would need to provide two months’ notice. Option (4) is incorrect because Lucy would need to provide at least two months’ notice to end the tenancy."
"Question 514: When can an appeal be made to the Supreme Court of British Columbia regarding a real property assessment value? 
(1)When a property owner receives their assessment notice 
(2)After receipt of the Property Assessment Appeal Board decision, and then only on a point of law 
(3)When a property owner receives their assessment notice 
(4)After receiving notification of the decision of the Property Assessment Review Panel","Answer: 2 Explanation: Option (2) is correct because an appeal against a real property assessment must be submitted to the Property Assessment Panel for initial adjudication. Subsequently, an appeal may be made to the Property Assessment Appeal Board. An appeal can then be made from the Property Assessment Appeal Board to the Supreme Court of British Columbia, only if it is based on a point of law. Option (1) is incorrect because an appeal must first be submitted to the Property Assessment Panel. Option (3) is incorrect because an appeal may reach the Supreme Court of British Columbia. Option (4) is incorrect because an appeal following a decision of the Property Assessment Review Panel must first be submitted to the Property Assessment Appeal Board."
"Question 515: If an offer is made by mail and the acceptance is mailed, when is the acceptance effective? 
(1)When it is received by the offeree 
(2)When it is received by the offeror 
(3)When it is received by the offeree 
(4)From the date and time of the postmark on the envelope","Answer: 3 Explanation: Option (3) is correct because the “postal acceptance rule” provides that where an offer is made by mail, or other non-instantaneous means, acceptance is effective when it is posted. Option (1) is incorrect because the offeree is the party accepting the offer. Option (2) is incorrect because, if an offer is made by mail, acceptance need not be received by the offeror to be effective. Option (4) is incorrect because, in some cases, a document may not be postmarked the very day it is posted."
"Question 516: Where a borrower believes that the amount of interest being charged is excessive, under which statute might relief be granted? 
(1)The Interest Act 
(2)The Business Practices and Consumer Protection Act 
(3)The Interest Act 
(4)All of the above","Answer: 2 Explanation: Option (2) is correct because, in British Columbia, the Business Practices and Consumer Protection Act gives courts the power to grant relief where a mortgage transaction is deemed inequitable, or where the cost of a loan is excessive and the transaction is harsh and unconscionable. Option (1) in incorrect because the federal Interest Act does not impose a limit on the rate of interest which can be charged in a mortgage transaction. Option (3) is incorrect because the Land Title Act does not provide for relief for excessive mortgage interest rates. Option (4) is incorrect because Options (1) and (3) are incorrect."
"Question 517: The Annual Percentage Rate (APR) is: 
(1)a requirement under the federal Interest Act. 
(2)also known as the stated interest rate. 
(3)a requirement under the federal Interest Act. 
(4)an interest rate that must be expressed with semi-annual compounding.","Answer: 3 Explanation: Option (3) is correct because the APR is the borrower’s contractual interest rate plus any non-interest financing charges such as and bonuses or fees. Option (1) is incorrect because the APR is not a requirement under the Federal Interest Act. Option (2) is incorrect because the APR includes non-interest financing charges, and thus may differ from the stated interest rate. Option (4) is incorrect because the APR is not expressed with semi-annual compounding."
"Question 518: Which one of the following lists accurately describes the correct criteria, as agreed upon by negotiation experts, for a successful negotiation? 
(1)Efficiency, a zero-sum game, minimal wasted resources, preservation of the relationship 
(2)Efficiency, satisfaction of both parties, distributive results, minimal wasted resources 
(3)Efficiency, a zero-sum game, minimal wasted resources, preservation of the relationship 
(4)Efficiency, a zero-sum game, satisfaction of both parties, preservation of the relationship","Answer: 3 Explanation: Option (3) is correct because these criteria characterize successful negotiations which are most likely to render optimal outcomes for both parties. Options (1) and (4) are incorrect because negotiation need not be a zero-sum game where the only solution is a compromise down the middle. Option (2) is incorrect because a “distributive perspective”, viewing negotiation as a conflict with one winner and one loser, can inhibit creative problem solving and makes it difficult to reach optimal results."
"Question 519: As a marketing incentive to speed up the sale of newly completed but unsold condominiums, a developer agrees to provide the buyers with first mortgages written at 8% rather than the going market rate of 13%, if they pay the $45,000 asking price. Under these circumstances, the developer would likely be equally satisfied (in cash equivalent terms) with an “all cash” offer: 
(1)less than $45,000. 
(2)more than $45,000. 
(3)less than $45,000. 
(4)that includes an additional bonus in order to purchase the unit.","Answer: 1 Explanation: Option (1) is correct. Since the market rate is higher than the contract rate, the market value of the mortgage is less than the face value of $45,000. The cash-equivalent value of the mortgage at 8% will be less than a $45,000 mortgage at 13%. Options (2), (3), and (4) are therefore incorrect."
"Question 520: Garfield, a licensee, was representing a seller, Madison, in the sale of his house to Tyler. After the sale completed, Tyler discovered that the main and lower floors of the house sloped. Garfield, Madison, and Tyler had not noticed this before, although the defect was discoverable using ordinary diligence. Based on the above, which of the following statements is TRUE? 
(1)Garfield had a duty to inspect the premises for soundness and structural defects before advertising it for sale. 
(2)The sloping floor is a patent defect that should have been brought to Tyler’s attention. 
(3)Garfield had a duty to inspect the premises for soundness and structural defects before advertising it for sale. 
(4)Both (1) and (2) are true statements.","Answer: 3 Explanation: Option (3) is correct because the sloped floors were a defect that could have been discovered during the course of a reasonable inspection. Therefore, the sloped floors were a patent defect. The general rule regarding patent defects is that the buyer assumes the risk (caveat emptor), meaning that the seller and the listing licensee are not required to disclose discoverable defects. Option (1) is incorrect because, while it can be prudent to do so, neither the seller nor the seller’s agent has a duty to inspect the premises prior to advertising it for sale. Option (2) is incorrect because a vendor is not required to disclose patent defects. Option (4) is incorrect because Options (1) and (2) are both incorrect."
"Question 521: Which of the following is considered to be an advantage of the mobile office environment? 
(1)It is easier to establish a sense of community within the brokerage in a mobile office environment. 
(2)The mobile office environment reduces certain inefficiencies, such as commuting, allowing licensees to focus their time on more productive tasks. 
(3)It is easier to establish a sense of community within the brokerage in a mobile office environment. 
(4)All of the above","Answer: 2 Explanation: Option (2) is correct because the mobile office environment permits representatives to work from home, out in the field, or from other locations that the traditional offices. An advantage of this is that it eliminates certain inefficiencies, such as time spent commuting to and from the office, which allows representatives more time to focus on more productive, income-generating tasks. Option (1) is incorrect because due to decentralization, it is more difficult, not easier, to establish a sense of community within the brokerage in a mobile office environment. Option (3) is incorrect because representatives may feel disconnected from the brokerage when they are less physically present, resulting in a weaker sense of loyalty. Since Options (1) and (3) are incorrect, Option (4) is also incorrect."
"Question 522: The principle of good faith includes: 
(1)the duty of parties to a contract to fulfil their contractual obligations to the best of their ability. 
(2)the duty of a mortgagee not to commence foreclosure proceedings without giving the mortgagor ample time to cure the default. 
(3)the duty of parties to a contract to fulfil their contractual obligations to the best of their ability. 
(4)the duty of parties to a contract to act honestly in the performance of their contractual obligations.","Answer: 4 Explanation: Option (4) is correct because the principle of good faith includes the duty of honest performance, where parties to a contract are under a duty to act honestly in the performance of their contractual obligations. Options (1), (2), and (3) are incorrect because these are not duties included in the general organizing principle of good faith."
"Question 523: Which one of the following accurately describes the law with respect to security deposits on a commercial tenancy? 
(1)Security deposits must not exceed 50% of the monthly rental. 
(2)There is no limit on the amount of security deposit that may be charged. 
(3)Security deposits must not exceed 50% of the monthly rental. 
(4)Security deposits cannot exceed one month’s rent.","Answer: 2 Explanation: Option (2) is correct because, as far as commercial tenancies are concerned, there are no legal restrictions regarding security deposits. Options (1), (3), and (4) are incorrect for the same reason."
"Question 524: A trading services licensee who is not licensed to provide property management services CAN: 
(1)collect rent from tenants. 
(2)supervise contractors hired by the owner. 
(3)collect rent from tenants. 
(4)negotiate contractors on the owner's behalf other than the lease.",Answer: 3 Explanation: Option (3) is correct because the definitions of “trading services” and a “trade in real estate” in the Real Estate Services Act permit trading services licensees to negotiate lease terms. The remaining options are incorrect because they describe activities that do not fall within the definition of trading services.
"Question 525: Julie is acting as the listing licensee for a property owned by her client, George. Julie also represents a client, Ahmed, whom she is helping find a suitable property to buy. Ahmed becomes interested in purchasing George’s property. Julie would like to continue to represent George as a client in the sale of his property, while releasing Ahmed as a client. To do this, Julie must enter into an Agreement Regarding Conflict of Interest Between Clients with: 
(1)George, the continuing client, only 
(2)Ahmed, the released client, only 
(3)George, the continuing client, only 
(4)Neither George nor Ahmed, as the Agreement Regarding Conflict of Interest Between Clients must only be agreed to by Julie’s managing broker","Answer: 3 Explanation: Option (3) is correct because when a licensee is faced with a conflict of interest between multiple clients, the licensee must enter into an Agreement Regarding Conflict of Interest Between Clients with all clients. Options (1), (2), and (4) are incorrect for this reason."
"Question 526: Which one of the following statutes affects the real property taxation system in British Columbia? 
(1)Real Estate Services Act 
(2)School Act 
(3)Real Estate Services Act 
(4)Land Transfer Form Act",Answer: 2 Explanation: Option (2) is correct because the School Act is one of seven statutes which form the foundation of the real property tax system in British Columbia. The School Act provides for real property taxation to fund public
"Question 527: Martha, who has been George’s landlord for the past three months, has seized George’s furniture from his rented premises and threatens to sell the furniture in order to pay George’s arrears of rent. Which one of the following statements is FALSE? 
(1)Martha has chosen an illegal remedy against George if the rented premises is George’s personal residence. 
(2)Martha has chosen a remedy called “distress” or “distraint”. 
(3)Martha has chosen an illegal remedy against George if the rented premises is George’s personal residence. 
(4)Martha has taken an action that can be described as a classic example of a private nuisance.","Answer: 4 Explanation: Option (4) is correct because private nuisance typically occurs where an owner or occupier of land unreasonably and substantially interferes with the reasonable use and enjoyment of a neighbouring property. Option (1) is incorrect because section 26(3) of the Residential Tenancy Act abolishes the remedy of distress in residential tenancies. Option (2) is incorrect because “distraint” or “distress” means a seizure and sale of the tenant’s personal property to recover arrears of rent. Option (3) is incorrect because a commercial landlord can exercise the remedy of distress, which is often the most effective remedy available to the landlord."
"Question 528: Which of the following statements about the trial process in British Columbia is FALSE? 
(1)Our common law system is based on an adversarial process in which each of the two opposing parties presents its point of view to an impartial trier of fact whose decision is binding on both parties. 
(2)A plaintiff commences an action by filing a notice of civil claim in the court registry; once served with the notice of civil claim, the defendant can answer by denying some or all of the claims set out in the plaintiff’s notice of civil claim by filing a response to civil claim. 
(3)Our common law system is based on an adversarial process in which each of the two opposing parties presents its point of view to an impartial trier of fact whose decision is binding on both parties. 
(4)The plaintiff and defendant alternate in calling their witnesses.","Answer: 4 Explanation: Option (4) is correct because, in British Columbia, the plaintiff calls each of its witnesses first. Once the defendant’s lawyer has had the opportunity to cross-examine each witness called by the plaintiff, the defendant then calls each of its own witnesses. Options (1), (2), and (3) are incorrect because each statement accurately describes the trial process in British Columbia."
"Question 529: Which of the following people may NOT require an appraisal of real property? 
(1)The executor of an estate 
(2)A property assessment appellant 
(3)The executor of an estate 
(4)A strata council","Answer: 4 Explanation: Option (4) is correct as a strata council is the only party listed that is not likely to require an appraisal. Options (1), (2), and (3) are incorrect because each of these parties are likely to require an appraisal."
"Question 530: When preparing a market value appraisal of a single-family residence, which of the following is LEAST likely to be an acceptable valuation practice? 
(1)Rely on the owner’s information as to the type of water supply piping in the property provided that you note in the appraisal report the source of your information, and that it has not been verified. 
(2)Ignore above-average quality of construction if the buyers and sellers in the neighbourhood do not consider high quality materials important. 
(3)Rely on the owner’s information as to the type of water supply piping in the property provided that you note in the appraisal report the source of your information, and that it has not been verified. 
(4)Rely upon the income approach as the primary method of appraisal.","Answer: 4 Explanation: The correct answer is Option (4) since the income approach is more likely a primary method of appraisal for a commercial property valuation with income and expense data, rather than a single-family residence. Options (1) and (2) are incorrect because they describe warranted valuation practices. Option (3) is considered warranted, because although the two houses have similar floor plans and are in the same neighborhood, a sale without sufficient advertising may signal a non-arm’s length sale and would not be considered reliable."
"Question 531: Which one of the following is NOT a depreciable asset? 
(1)A septic tank system 
(2)50 acres of land 
(3)A septic tank system 
(4)A concrete patio","Answer: 2 Explanation: Land does not depreciate; therefore Option (2) is correct. Options (1), (3), and (4) are depreciable assets."
"Question 532: Value in exchange is: 
(1)commonly referred to as value to the owner. 
(2)the sale price. 
(3)commonly referred to as value to the owner. 
(4)a range of mutual profit.","Answer: 2 Explanation: Option (2) is correct because the value in exchange is the sale price of the home. Options (1), (3), and (4) are therefore incorrect."
"Question 533: Which of the following is NOT a characteristic of a fee simple estate? 
(1)It is held subject to the Crown’s land use regulations. 
(2)It may be expropriated by the Crown. 
(3)It is held subject to the Crown’s land use regulations. 
(4)Its owner has it only for as long as they have heirs.","Answer: 3 Explanation: Option (3) is correct because a leasehold interest is of a fixed duration, whereas a fee simple estate confers the right to possess and use land for an indefinite period of time. Option (1) is incorrect because, while the fee simple estate is the greatest estate in land in Canadian law, the Crown retains underlying title to all land. Therefore, fee simple estates remain subject to the Crown’s land use regulations. Option (2) is incorrect because, though rarely exercised, the Crown retains the prerogative power to expropriate land held in fee simple. Option (4) is incorrect because land held in fee simple will escheat (or, revert) back to the Crown if the owner of the estate dies without providing for the transfer of his or her property by way of will and has no known heirs."
"Question 534: Yang was the owner of an office building in downtown Vancouver. She recently sold the building to Ashley for $100 million. Ashley did not pay the GST on the sale and Yang has just received an assessment for the GST due on the sale of the property from the Canada Revenue Agency (“CRA”) worth $5 million. Which of the following statements is FALSE? 
(1)The $5 million is collectible immediately by the CRA. 
(2)Yang will have 90 days from the date of the assessment to file an objection with the CRA if she wishes to dispute it. 
(3)The $5 million is collectible immediately by the CRA. 
(4)Yang may pursue Ashley for the uncollected GST that she has been assessed for.","Answer: 3 Explanation: Option (3) is correct (false) because if Yang files an objection and an appeals officer at the CRA confirms the assessment, Yang would have 90 days to appeal to the Tax Court of Canada. She could also potentially appeal the decision to the Federal Court of Appeal and then possibly to the Supreme Court of Canada. Options (1), (2), and (4) are incorrect because they are all true statements."
"Question 535: An offer to purchase real estate: 
(1)must have the words “or nominee” or “or assignee” if the buyer wishes to assign the contract. 
(2)must by default have standard terms relating to contract assignments unless the buyer instructs otherwise. 
(3)must have the words “or nominee” or “or assignee” if the buyer wishes to assign the contract. 
(4)cannot be assigned.","Answer: 2 Explanation: Option (2) is correct because unless the buyer instructs otherwise, an offer to purchase real estate must have standard terms relating to contract assignment. Option (1) is incorrect because the Knowledge Base, “Assignment Guidelines”, states that these words should not be used to describe the buyer. Option (3) is incorrect because assignments are permissible only as long as the Standard Assignment Terms are included in the contract of purchase and sale of real estate, and provided that the assignment does not prejudice the rights of the seller and the contract does not prohibit assignment. Option (4) is incorrect because a contract of purchase and sale can be assigned if certain requirements are met."
"Question 536: Which of the following is an example of an action that a criminal may take during the placement stage of the money-laundering process? 
(1)Arranging for multiple people to deposit small amounts of cash at different financial institutions 
(2)Transferring money through a succession of bank accounts in different jurisdictions 
(3)Arranging for multiple people to deposit small amounts of cash at different financial institutions 
(4)Frequently transferring ownership of a particular property between multiple acquaintances","Answer: 1 Explanation: Option (1) is correct because it is an action taken during the placement stage, meant to avoid drawing the attention of financial institutions which would take note of unusually large cash deposits. Options (2) and (4) are incorrect because they are actions taken during the layering stage of the money-laundering process, meant to increase complexity and conceal the criminal origins of the proceeds. Option (3) is incorrect because it is an action taken during the integration stage. The sale of real estate will provide proceeds which appear to have been legally earned from investment."
"Question 537: Using the cost approach, determine the market value of a property with a 37,000 square foot building if construction costs new are $62 per square foot, land value is estimated to be $1,200,000, and total depreciation on the building to date is estimated to be 8%. 
(1)$2,294,000 
(2)$3,310,480 
(3)$2,294,000

"Question 538: Which of the following is defined as a marketing initiative that involves face-to-face communication with a potential consumer? 
(1)Telemarketing 
(2)Emotional appeal 
(3)Telemarketing 
(4)Personal selling","Answer: 4 Explanation: Option (4) is correct because personal selling involves interactive, face-to-face communication with a potential customer. Option (1) is incorrect because telemarketing uses telephone or fax technology in place of face-to-face communication. Option (2) is incorrect because emotional appeal refers to a communications strategy that aims to stir up positive or negative emotions in an audience in order to generate a desired response. Option (3) is incorrect because brand marketing refers to a marketing initiative based on the theme of a business, which encompasses a variety of attributes that distinguish the business from its competitors."
"Question 539: There is a large Olympic-sized pool in the backyard of the home Margaret owns in Coquitlam. Each week in the summer, a worker from a pool maintenance company comes in and cleans the pool. Usually when he is cleaning the pool, the backwash runs over and chlorinated water leaks down on the garden of the neighbour below, killing the flowers. Both Margaret and the worker from the pool company are aware of what is happening. This would be considered which of the following? 
(1)A breach of the duty of care under the BC Occupiers Liability Act 
(2)A private nuisance 
(3)A breach of the duty of care under the BC Occupiers Liability Act 
(4)Occupiers liability","Answer: 2 Explanation: Option (2) is correct because a private nuisance occurs when an owner or occupier of land unreasonably and substantially interferes with the reasonable use and enjoyment of a neighbouring property. Private nuisance typically occurs when an owner or occupier wrongfully allows the escape of injurious things (in this case, chlorinated water) onto another person’s land. Options (1) and (4) are incorrect because occupiers liability and the British Columbia Occupiers Liability Act concern the liability of an occupier for injury suffered by visitors entering their own premises, not for losses occurring on someone else’s property. Option (3) is incorrect because a patent defect is a defect in property that can be discovered during the course of a reasonable inspection. On the facts of this question, there is no indication that the leak was caused by any defect in the property of either Margaret or the neighbour."
"Question 540: The income approach is NOT usually used for the valuation of: 
(1)single-family residences. 
(2)warehouses. 
(3)single-family residences. 
(4)single-storey retail complexes.","Answer: 1 Explanation: Option (1) is correct because the income approach would not usually be used for the valuation of single-family residences. Options (2), (3) and (4) are incorrect because this approach can be used in appraising most types of property, although it is more appropriate for properties that produce rental income, e.g., apartment buildings, office buildings, industrial space."
"Question 541: On March 7, Allan contracts, in writing, to sell his home to Bob for the price of $100,000. The sale is to complete on March 31. On March 8, the house is destroyed. Accordingly, there has been: 
(1)a mutual mistake. 
(2)a frustration of the contract. 
(3)a mutual mistake. 
(4)a rescission of the contract.","Answer: 2 Explanation: Option (2) is correct because, after a contract has been made, but before it has been performed, it will be frustrated if events outside of the control of the parties destroy the subject matter of the contract. Options (1) and (3) are incorrect because, on the facts of this question, neither Allan nor Bob made a mistake relating to the contract. Option (4) is incorrect because the effect of frustration is the termination of the contract. In other words, the contract is ended at the point of frustration, and future rights and liabilities no longer apply. Termination is distinct from rescission in that rescission operates to “unmake” a contract, attempting to return the parties back to the position they were in prior to entering the contract."
"Question 542: Which of the following statements regarding mortgagees is FALSE? 
(1)A mortgagee may require the addition of a guarantor to provide a separate personal covenant as a third party in addition to the borrower’s personal covenant to pay. 
(2)Where the property secured is a condominium, a mortgagee may require the borrower to grant to the mortgagee the right to vote at meetings of the strata corporation on various matters affecting the security of the mortgage. 
(3)A mortgagee may require the addition of a guarantor to provide a separate personal covenant as a third party in addition to the borrower’s personal covenant to pay. 
(4)Once the mortgage terms have been agreed to by the mortgagor and the mortgagee, the mortgagee is bound to advance the total amount of the funds when requested by the borrower, regardless of the terms of the mortgage.","Answer: 4 Explanation: Option (4) is correct because most mortgages contain a term which states that the mortgagee (the lender) shall not be bound for any reason whatsoever to advance any part of the money to the mortgagor (the borrower). If, for example, a builder’s lien is filed against the property, the lender may require the removal of the lien before advancing funds. Option (1) is incorrect because a lender may require a guarantor as a form of additional security for the loan. Option (2) is incorrect because the Strata Property Act provides that a lender can obtain the right to vote at meetings of the strata corporation on matters relating to insurance, maintenance, finance or other matters affecting the security of the mortgage. Option (3) is incorrect because lenders are generally given complete discretion to select from the available remedies. This ensures that lenders are given the greatest possible chance to recover their losses resulting from a borrower default."
"Question 543: Conditions precedent are usually included in contracts of purchase and sale to protect the buyer. However, since conditions precedent can also be abused by buyers, a seller must be protected when a condition precedent is being included in a contract of purchase and sale. Which of the following additions to the contract of purchase and sale is NOT a valid method of protecting a seller’s interests? 
(1)A specific time within which the condition must be removed can be included in the contract of purchase and sale. 
(2)A clause requiring a Property Disclosure Statement to be filled out can be included in the contract of purchase and sale. 
(3)A specific time within which the condition must be removed can be included in the contract of purchase and sale. 
(4)A time clause can be included, which gives the seller the right to demand that the buyer remove the condition precedent within 72 hours.","Answer: 2 Explanation: Option (2) is correct because it is in the buyer’s (not the seller’s) best interests to incorporate a Property Disclosure Statement (PDS) into the contract of purchase and sale. Doing so incorporates the warranties made by the seller in the PDS into the contract of purchase and sale, which allows the buyer to sue the seller for breach of contract if such warranties are breached. Option (1) is incorrect because it allows the seller to review the buyer’s progress with regards to the fulfilment of the condition and decide whether or not to extend the time limit or to terminate the agreement. Option (3) is incorrect because if such a covenant is inserted into the contract of purchase and sale, and the buyer does not use his or her best efforts to satisfy the specific condition, the seller can sue the buyer for breach of contract. Option (4) is incorrect because a including a 72-hour “time clause” allows the seller to demand that the buyer remove the condition precedent within 72 hours in the event that the seller receives another offer. If the buyer fails to do so, then the seller can accept the other offer."
"Question 544: Which one of the following is TRUE where a comparable property is sold subject to a vendor supplied mortgage at an interest rate lower than the current market rate? 
(1)The comparable property may never be used as evidence of market value. 
(2)The comparable sale price must be adjusted upward. 
(3)The comparable property may never be used as evidence of market value. 
(4)The comparable sale price must be adjusted downward.","Answer: 4 Explanation: Option (4) is correct because when a comparable property is sold subject to a low interest rate, the comparable sale price must be adjusted downward. Option (1) is false because the comparable property can be used as evidence of market value, as long as an adjustment is made for the “cheap” financing provided by the vendor. Option (2) is false because the comparable sale price must be adjusted downward to compensate for the benefit provided by the below-market interest rate on the mortgage. Option (3) is false because the price of the comparable property needs to be adjusted to its cash-equivalent price."
"Question 545: An appraiser has located a comparable where the sale price was $220,000, comprised of $105,000 cash and a $115,000 vendor take-back mortgage written at 3.5% per annum, compounded semi-annually, with monthly payments sufficient to fully amortize the loan over 20 years. Assuming that the market rate for similar financing is 5% per annum, compounded semi-annually, what should the appraiser regard as the sale price of the house? (Round answer to the nearest $100). 
(1)$101,300 
(2)$220,000 
(3)$101,300

"Question 547: Norm Abrahm has offered $231,000 for a house, providing he is able to obtain acceptable financing. The house lists for $242,000, but the lender has appraised the house at $238,000. The lender requires a loan-to-value ratio of 80% and a gross debt service ratio of 28%. Property taxes are $1,750 per year and Mr. Abrahm’s annual gross income is $85,000. If the interest rate is 12% per annum, compounded annually, the amortization period is 15 years, and payments are made monthly, what is the maximum amount this lender will advance, rounded to the nearest $10? 
(1)$149,910 
(2)$178,500 
(3)$149,910 
(4)$190,400","Answer: 3 Explanation: To answer this question, calculate the maximum amount of money that can be lent out given the two constraints: the loan-to-value amount and the gross debt service ratio amount. Calculate the loan amount for the loan-to-value constraint and then calculate the loan amount for the GDSR constraint. In order to determine the maximum amount that the lender will advance, choose the lesser of the two results. LTV = 80%"
"Question 548: Which of the following clauses contained in a mortgage would constitute a clog on the equity of redemption and therefore be void? 
(1)Collateral advantage clause 
(2)Option to purchase clause 
(3)Collateral advantage clause 
(4)Acceleration clause","Answer: 2 Explanation: Option (2) is correct because an option to purchase clause, if exercised, would deny the borrower his or her right to redeem title to the property upon repayment of the loan. In other words, if the bank exercised the option and chose to purchase the property, then the borrower would necessarily be unable to redeem title upon repayment. Option (1) is incorrect because collateral advantage clauses are no longer considered clogs on the borrower’s equity of redemption, even if they extend beyond the term of the mortgage. Option (3) is incorrect because indemnity clauses do not constitute clogs on the equity of redemption, and are instead rendered unenforceable by section 8(1) of the federal Interest Act. Option (4) is incorrect because an acceleration clause is a term in the mortgage contract which makes the outstanding balance of the loan immediately due and payable if the borrower defaults. Acceleration clauses do not interfere with the borrower’s right to redeem title upon repayment, since they operate in situations where the borrower has defaulted."
"Question 549: The MOST effective remedy available to a landlord when a tenant does not pay the rent in a commercial tenancy is: 
(1)an injunction. 
(2)a garnishing order. 
(3)an injunction. 
(4)a demand letter.","Answer: 3 Explanation: Option (3) is correct because the remedy of distress allows a commercial landlord to seize and sell a tenant’s personal property in order to satisfy a claim for rent owing. This is the most effective remedy because it immediately gives the landlord tangible assets which can be sold to recover the debt. Option (1) is incorrect because a tenant may choose to disobey an injunction, which would require that the landlord take additional legal action against them. Option (2) is incorrect because the third party to whom the garnishing order is served may still disobey the garnishing order. There are also additional limitations to this remedy, including a limit on the percentage that may be garnished from an employee’s wages. Option (4) is incorrect because a demand letter may be ignored by the tenant, in which case the landlord would be required to pursue additional action."
"Question 550: Where an agent with authority enters into a contract with a third party and does not disclose that they are acting as an agent: 
(1)the third party may sue either the agent or the principal to enforce the contract. 
(2)the principal may sue the agent to enforce the contract. 
(3)the third party may sue either the agent or the principal to enforce the contract. 
(4)there is no contract in existence because there is no disclosure.","Answer: 1 Explanation: Option (1) is correct because, at common law, where an agent does not disclose to a third party that he or she is acting as an agent, the agent may be held liable as a principal. This rule is justified because the third party was led to believe that it was making a contract with the agent personally, and might not have chosen to enter a contract with the principal had they been aware of the principal’s existence and/or identity. Option (2) is incorrect because the contract is not between the agent and the principal, but is instead between the principal and the third party (though the agent may be held liable as a principal, as mentioned previously). Option (3) is incorrect because the contract remains between the principal and the third party, and therefore, the principal may sue the third party to enforce it. Option (4) is incorrect because an agent’s failure to disclose their status as an agent does not render a contract void."
"Question 551: In mortgage financing, a constant payment mortgage is one where: 
(1)each payment is identical to the preceding one. 
(2)the payments are comprised of a constant amount of principal plus interest due. 
(3)each payment is identical to the preceding one. 
(4)principal and interest are the same amount for each payment.",Answer: 1 Explanation: Option (1) is correct because a constant payment mortgage has identical periodic payments. Options (2) and (3) describe a straight line principal reduction loan. Option (4) is incorrect because the constant payment is apportioned to varying levels of principal and interest.
"Question 552: A trading services representative must never promise to sell real estate belonging to a prospective client, as an inducement to enter into a listing agreement with the licensee’s brokerage: 
(1)unless at the time of making the promise, a signed statement setting forth the details of the promise is given to the person to whom the promise has been made. 
(2)unless at the time of making the promise, the representative has in fact lined up a buyer for the property. 
(3)unless at the time of making the promise, a signed statement setting forth the details of the promise is given to the person to whom the promise has been made. 
(4)unless the buyer is also a licensee.","Answer: 1 Explanation: Option (1) is correct because the Real Estate Services Rules prohibit a licensee from making inducement promises of this nature unless the licensee gives a signed statement containing the details of the promise to the person to whom the promise is made. A licensee who breaches this prohibition may be suspended by the British Columbia Financial Services Authority. Options (2), (3), and (4) are incorrect because none of these scenarios alleviate the licensee’s obligation to give a signed statement, setting forth the details of the promise, to the person to whom the promise is being made."
"Question 553: A property owner is making an application to the municipal council to amend a zoning bylaw. Which of the following steps is NOT a part of the rezoning process? 
(1)The municipal council must vote in favour of the amendment on four different occasions (readings). 
(2)According to the Local Government Act, the municipal council must wait at least six months before approving the amendment. 
(3)The municipal council must vote in favour of the amendment on four different occasions (readings). 
(4)The applicant may be required to give a presentation about the amendment and answer questions from the municipal council at a public hearing.","Answer: 2 Explanation: Option (2) is correct because the municipal council is not required to wait at least six months before approving an amendment to a zoning bylaw. Option (1) is incorrect because any rezoning bylaw must be given four readings by the municipal council, meaning that the council must vote in favour of the bylaw four separate times. Option (3) is incorrect because subdivision bylaws, made under the Local Government Act, may require that an owner dedicate up to five percent of his or her land for park purposes. In addition, sometimes an applicant will be required to pay for the widening of roads. Option (4) is incorrect because after a proposed rezoning bylaw receives a favourable first (or sometimes second) reading, a public hearing is usually held. At the hearing, the applicant may be required to give a short presentation, and will be asked questions about the proposal by the municipal council."
"Question 554: You have a partially completed appraisal report that you need to fill in. The subject property has 4 bedrooms and 4 bathrooms. The house next door is similar in all respects except for the number of bedrooms and bathrooms. It sold for $225,500 and has 3 bedrooms and 3 bathrooms. If the market value of a bedroom is $4,000 and the market value of a bathroom is $5,700, this comparable will have to be adjusted for bedrooms and bathrooms by: 
(1)–$4,000 and –$5,700 respectively. 
(2)+$6,400 and +$5,700 respectively. 
(3)–$4,000 and –$5,700 respectively. 
(4)+$5,700 and +$4,000 respectively.","Answer: 3 Explanation: Option (3) is correct because in relation to the subject property, this comparable requires an adjustment of +$4,000 for 1 bedroom and +$5,700 for 1 bathroom. Options (1), (2), and (4) are therefore incorrect."
"Question 555: In order for a person to make a successful claim against the Assurance Fund in British Columbia, they must prove three of the following. Indicate the EXCEPTION. 
(1)They have lost an interest or estate in land. 
(2)They cannot recover that interest or estate by court action. 
(3)They have lost an interest or estate in land. 
(4)If the Land Title Act had not been passed, they would have recovered the interest in land by a court action.","Answer: 3 Explanation: Option (3) is correct because, in addition to compensating victims of fraud, the Assurance Fund also provides compensation to individuals who have suffered loss or damages caused, solely or partially, by an omission, mistake or misfeasance of the registrar or employees of the Land Title Office. Options (1), (2), and (4) are incorrect because a claimant must prove the following to successfully claim against the Assurance Fund in British Columbia: (a) that the claimant has lost an interest in land as a result of the registration of a person other than the claimant as owner; (b) that the claimant cannot recover that estate or interest (or compensation for it) by a court action; and (c) that, if the Land Title Act had not been passed, the claimant would have recovered the estate or interest at common law by a court action."
"Question 556: Using the comparative approach of appraisal to value properties with redevelopment potential, it is NOT necessary that the comparables and the subject property: 
(1)have a similar highest and best use after redevelopment. 
(2)have a similar current use. 
(3)have a similar highest and best use after redevelopment. 
(4)expect to undergo redevelopment at a similar point in time.","Answer: 3 Explanation: Option (3) is correct because when using the comparative approach of appraisal to value properties with redevelopment potential, it is not necessary that the comparables and the subject property have a market value of zero in their current use. Options (1), (2), and (4) are incorrect because it is necessary that they have a similar highest and best use after redevelopment, have a similar current use, and expect to undergo redevelopment at a similar point in time."
"Question 557: A seller refuses to acknowledge the waiver of a condition precedent from a contract of purchase and sale. Assuming that the condition was made exclusively for the benefit of the buyer and the waiver was made prior to the expiry of the condition precedent, the agreement is: 
(1)one that is not binding on either party. 
(2)voidable at the option of the seller. 
(3)one that is not binding on either party. 
(4)voidable at the option of the buyer.","Answer: 3 Explanation: Option (3) is correct because section 54 of the Law and Equity Act provides that where a condition precedent is for the sole benefit of the buyer, the buyer is allowed to unilaterally waive the condition prior to its expiration. Section 54 overrides the common law rule preventing the unilateral waiver of a true condition precedent. Option (1) is incorrect because the agreement remains valid and enforceable in this situation. Options (2) and (4) are incorrect because, in this situation, the agreement does not become voidable at either the option of the seller or the buyer."
"Question 558: When, with respect to commercial tenancies, there is said to be an implied covenant of quiet enjoyment, it means: 
(1)that the landlord will refrain and will cause others to refrain from entering into competition with the tenant’s business. 
(2)that the tenant will conduct their affairs in such a manner as not to violate local noise bylaws and that, if they do, they will be liable for any fines or penalties levied. 
(3)that the landlord will refrain and will cause others to refrain from entering into competition with the tenant’s business. 
(4)that the landlord will ensure that all tenants conduct their affairs in such a manner as not to violate local noise bylaws.","Answer: 3 Explanation: Option (3) is correct because, with respect to commercial tenancies, the implied covenant of quiet enjoyment does not simply refer to freedom from noise; rather, it is an assurance to the tenant against the consequences of defective title. This means that if the landlord, or anyone who claims to have received rights from the landlord, attacks the tenant’s right to the premises, it would breach this covenant. Option (1) is incorrect because the implied covenant of quiet enjoyment does not concern competition with the tenant’s business. Option (2) is incorrect because the implied covenant of quiet enjoyment is an implied promise given by the landlord to the tenant, and does not restrict the tenant’s own conduct on the property. Option (4) is incorrect because the implied covenant of quiet enjoyment does not constitute a guarantee by the landlord that other tenants will comply with local noise bylaws."
"Question 559: A private investor expects to receive $281.72 per month for a period of 17 years as a result of a mortgage loan she has just advanced. Calculate the investor’s expected yield (expressed as a nominal rate with semi-annual compounding) on her investment if the loan was for $23,250.

"Question 560: Which of the following statements about restrictive covenants is FALSE? 
(1)A restrictive covenant must be negative in nature. 
(2)Both the benefited and burdened land must be precisely identified in the agreement or document creating the restrictive covenant. 
(3)A restrictive covenant must be negative in nature. 
(4)The covenantor must retain the restricted property, as any subsequent buyer will not be a party to the original contract.","Answer: 4 Explanation: Option (4) is correct because a restrictive covenant is an interest in land which can be registered at the Land Title Office. Once a valid restrictive covenant has been registered, it binds subsequent owners of the property (i.e., it “runs with the land”). Therefore, the covenantor (the person who agrees to be bound by the restriction) need not retain the restricted property for the restrictive covenant to remain valid. Option (1) is incorrect because, in order to be a valid restrictive covenant, an owner must be able to comply with the covenant by not doing something. If a covenant requires action it is a “positive” covenant, and does not run with the land. Options (2) and (3) are both incorrect because each statement is one of the five essential requirements of a valid restrictive covenant."
"Question 561: An agent’s duty to the principal not to make a secret profit means that an agent must keep the principal fully informed about which of the following? 
(1)All of the agent’s personal business dealings 
(2)The agent’s annual tax return 
(3)All of the agent’s personal business dealings 
(4)Only the actual profits received by the agent","Answer: 3 Explanation: Option (3) is correct because an agent owes a duty of loyalty to the principal, which requires them to disclose to the principal all facts relevant to the transaction within the agent’s knowledge. The complete disclosure requirement prohibits an agent from making a “secret” profit, meaning that the agent must disclose all of the benefits and prospective benefits received by the agent as a result of, or in the course of, performing duties on behalf of the principal. Option (1) is incorrect because the agent is not required to disclose all of their personal business dealings to the principal if those dealings do not affect the interests of the principal. Option (2) is incorrect because the agent is not required to inform the principal of their own annual tax return, as this information does not affect the interests of the principal. Option (4) is incorrect because an agent has a duty to disclose all relevant facts that could influence the conduct of the principal. This duty is not limited to situations where the agent is receiving actual profits, and extends to situations where the agent will suffer a loss."
"Question 562: In appraising an income-producing property using the income approach, gross potential rents must be estimated. How are gross potential rents BEST determined? 
(1)Based on long-term vacancy rates in the area in which the subject property is located 
(2)Based on published surveys of relevant real estate trends 
(3)Based on long-term vacancy rates in the area in which the subject property is located 
(4)Based on current market rents of similar properties","Answer: 4 Explanation: Option (4) is correct because gross potential revenue is estimated using current market rents paid on similar properties. Even when the subject or comparable property is fully rented, the rents used in determining the property’s net operating income should be compared to current rental prices. Therefore, Options (1), (2), and (3) are incorrect."
"Question 563: When a strata corporation grants an owner or tenant of a strata lot the permission to exclusively use common property as a short term exclusive use: 
(1)the permission requires approval by a ¾ vote at a general meeting of the strata corporation, unless the short term exclusive use is to endure for less than six months. 
(2)the permission may be granted by a majority vote of the strata council if the permission does not involve a significant change in the use or appearance of the common property. 
(3)the permission requires approval by a ¾ vote at a general meeting of the strata corporation, unless the short term exclusive use is to endure for less than six months. 
(4)the strata corporation must not grant the permission for more than one month.","Answer: 2 Explanation: Option (2) is correct because the Strata Property Act gives strata corporations the ability to grant an owner or tenant permission to exclusively use common property for a period of less than one year. If the permission does not involve a significant change in the use or appearance of the common property, then the permission can be granted by a majority vote of the strata council. Option (1) is incorrect because approval by a ¾ vote, rather than a simple majority vote, at a general meeting of the strata corporation is only required where the permission or privilege granted involves a significant change in the use or appearance of the property. Option (3) is incorrect because permission to exclusively use common property may only be granted for less than one year, whereas the designation of limited common property has no fixed duration and need not be renewed. Therefore, the permission to exclusively use common property cannot be identical to the designation of limited common property. Option (4) is incorrect because the strata corporation may grant the permission for up to one year."
"Question 564: Which one of the following is NOT an activity of a Board of Variance? 
(1)To permit a structural alteration to a building used for a non-conforming use 
(2)To hear an appeal where the enforcement of a zoning bylaw will cause undue hardship 
(3)To permit a structural alteration to a building used for a non-conforming use 
(4)To establish a time limit within which construction of a minor variance must be completed","Answer: 3 Explanation: Option (3) is correct because a Board of Variance does not have the jurisdiction to amend zoning bylaws. Instead, the function of a Board of Variance is to permit minor exceptions, or “variances”, to existing bylaws, without altering the bylaws themselves. Amending zoning bylaws is the responsibility of municipal councils and regional districts. Options (1), (2), and (4) are incorrect because a Board of Variance is given the authority to hear appeals in situations where the enforcement of a bylaw would cause undue hardship. To achieve this purpose, the Board may permit a structural alteration to a building used for a non-conforming use, and may establish time limits within which construction of a variance must be completed."
"Question 565: The REALTOR® Code of Ethics is enforced by the: 
(1)Canadian Real Estate Association. 
(2)local real estate boards. 
(3)Canadian Real Estate Association. 
(4)British Columbia Financial Services Authority.","Answer: 2 Explanation: Option (2) is correct because the REALTOR® Code of Ethics is enforced by the local real estate boards in British Columbia. Option (1) is incorrect because, while the Canadian Real Estate Association establishes the REALTOR® Code of Ethics, enforcement occurs at the local board level. Option (3) is incorrect because the British Columbia Real Estate Association is responsible for representing the interests of local real estate boards, and their members on provincial matters, and does not directly enforce the REALTOR® Code of Ethics. Option (4) is incorrect because the British Columbia Financial Services Authority (“BCFSA”) is a statutory body tasked with administering the Real Estate Services Act (RESA) and related regulations, and rules. The REALTOR® Code of Ethics is set by the Canadian Real Estate Association, which is a professional trade organization that is separate from BCFSA."
"Question 566: Which of the following information is NOT necessary for a brokerage to keep in the real estate trade record sheet? 
(1)The date of the MLS® listing 
(2)The sale price or other consideration for the trade in real estate 
(3)The date of the MLS® listing 
(4)The names and addresses of all parties to the trade in real estate","Answer: 1 Explanation: Option (1) is correct because a real estate trade record sheet is required for each transaction in which the brokerage or a related licensee holds or receives money. Since listing a property on the MLS® listing occurs prior to such a transaction, this information does not need to be included in the record sheet. Options (2), (3), and (4) are incorrect because each contains information that is necessary to accurately describe and record real estate transactions."
"Question 567: Sections 15 and 18(1) of the Manufactured Home Act provide that no person shall move a manufactured home UNLESS: 
(1)the manufactured home is registered in the land titles office. 
(2)the manufactured home is registered in the manufactured homes registry, and a transport permit has been obtained from the registrar. 
(3)the manufactured home is registered in the land titles office. 
(4)they are the registered owner of the manufactured home.","Answer: 2 Explanation: Option (2) is correct because section 15 of the Manufactured Home Act provides that no person may move a manufactured home unless it is registered in the manufactured homes registry. Additionally, section 18(1) requires that a transport permit be obtained from the registrar to authorize the movement of the home to a specific location. Option (1) is incorrect because the ownership, transfer and granting of charges of manufactured homes are not registered in the land title office. Option (3) is incorrect because a manufactured home with a security interest registered against it in the personal property registry can still be moved. The secured party remains protected because registrar is required to notify the secured party when an application for a transport permit is made. Option (4) is incorrect because, in certain cases, a landlord, a secured party, or any other person acting under a court order may obtain a transport permit authorizing them to move a manufactured home."
"Question 568: Bert and Ernie owned, as joint tenants, a revenue producing property, which was leased to Oscar. Ernie died, leaving a will, which gave his interest in the property to Grover. Grover is now demanding one-half of the rent paid by Oscar. Bert refuses this request. Which of the following statements is TRUE? 
(1)Bert and Grover now own the revenue producing property as joint tenants. 
(2)Bert and Grover now own the revenue producing property as tenants in common. 
(3)Bert and Grover now own the revenue producing property as joint tenants. 
(4)Ernie severed the joint tenancy by bequeathing his interest in the property to Grover. Therefore, Grover is entitled to a one-half interest in the property.","Answer: 3 Explanation: Option (3) in correct because joint tenants enjoy the right of survivorship, meaning that when one joint tenant dies, the entire estate automatically vests in the surviving joint tenant(s). Bert, therefore, became the sole owner of the revenue producing property immediately upon Ernie’s death and Ernie had no interest to dispose of in his will. Options (1) and (2) are incorrect because no interest in the property passed to Grover. Option (4) is incorrect because a joint tenant cannot sever a joint tenancy merely by bequeathing their interest in the property to a third party in their will. To sever the joint tenancy Ernie would have had to (a) destroy one of the four “unities” required for a joint tenancy to exist (e.g., by selling or mortgaging his estate); (b) partition the property via a mutual agreement with Bert; or (c) obtain a court order for partition."
"Question 569: There are three common types of void deeds. Which one is considered NOT to be a void deed? 
(1)An unregistered deed 
(2)A forged deed 
(3)An unregistered deed 
(4)A deed signed in circumstances where the party can plead non est factum","Answer: 1 Explanation: Option (1) is correct because section 20(1) of the Land Title Act provides that “except as against the person making it”, an unregistered transfer deed is inoperative. This section indicates that an unregistered deed remains operative between the transferor and the transferee. Option (2) is incorrect because it is a long standing common law rule that a forged deed is void from the beginning. Option (3) is incorrect because, where the consideration given exchange for a deed amounts to an illegal act or thing, the transfer deed is void. Option (4) is incorrect because where a party can successfully plead non est factum (“that is not my deed”) the deed in question will be rendered void for reason of unilateral mistake."
"Question 570: Which one of the following is FALSE with respect to the proprietorship form of business? 
(1)A proprietorship is terminated upon the death of the owner. 
(2)A proprietor must pay tax on their business income at personal tax rates. 
(3)A proprietorship is terminated upon the death of the owner. 
(4)There is no legal separation of the assets of the business and the other assets of its owner.","Answer: 3 Explanation: Option (3) is correct because, since a sole proprietorship is a business enterprise owned by a single individual, the owner of a proprietorship is personally liable for all the debts incurred by the proprietorship. This means that, if the proprietorship is unable to pay its debts, the proprietorship’s creditors may collect from the personal assets of the owner. Option (1) is incorrect because, since a proprietorship is not regarded as a separate legal entity from the owner, it is terminated upon the death of the owner. Option (2) is incorrect because the profits of a proprietorship accrue to the owner and are taxed as part of his or her personal income. Option (4) is incorrect because, as stated previously, a proprietorship is not regarded as a separate legal entity from the owner, and the owner has unlimited liability."
"Question 571: Hurston, the Head of Production at XYZ Preservatives Ltd., has been ordered by the company’s president, in Toronto, to vent some gasses that have been stored in a pressure chamber at the Vancouver plant. Although the president knows that the gas is highly toxic, Hurston has been assured by the president that the gas is totally harmless and will quickly dissipate when released. Unfortunately, having escaped from the pressure chamber, the gas drifts in a dense cloud over Ralph’s neighbouring apple orchard and destroys the apple crop. Which one of the following is TRUE? 
(1)Ralph will be successful in a claim against XYZ’s president under the doctrine of trespass. 
(2)Ralph will probably succeed in a claim against XYZ based on negligence. 
(3)Ralph will be successful in a claim against XYZ’s president under the doctrine of trespass. 
(4)Ralph would probably have a successful claim against XYZ based on the provisions of the Occupiers Liability Act.","Answer: 2 Explanation: Option (2) is correct because Ralph will likely be able to establish the three elements required for a successful negligence claim: (1) that XYZ, a company storing highly toxic gasses, owed him a duty of care as his neighbour; (2) that XYZ breached the standard of care by allowing the gas to drift over Ralph’s apple orchard; and (3) that the damage to Ralph’s orchard was reasonably foreseeable (i.e. not too remote). Option (1) is incorrect because trespass is an intentional tort, and consequently must be a direct, voluntary act, as opposed to an indirect result of an act. In this case, there is no indication that Hurston or the President intended to release the gas over Ralph’s apple orchard. Option (3) is incorrect because a fiduciary duty is only owed by a person who holds a legally significant position of trust with respect to someone else, and is obliged, by virtue of that relationship or trust, to act solely for the other person’s benefit. There is no indication, on the facts provided, that XYZ was in such a relationship of trust with Ralph. Option (4) is incorrect because the Occupiers Liability Act would only apply if Ralph had suffered damage while on XYZ’s premises."
"Question 572: Under the Residential Tenancy Act, the landlord is entitled to collect a security deposit equal to: 
(1)one half of one month’s rent. 
(2)one month’s rent. 
(3)one half of one month’s rent. 
(4)six months’ rent.","Answer: 1 Explanation: Option (1) is correct because the Regulations passed under the Residential Tenancy Act provide that a security deposit for a residential tenancy agreement cannot exceed one half of the monthly rent. Options (2), (3), and (4) are incorrect because each of these amounts exceeds the amount permitted under the Act."
"Question 573: Joe Carmichael borrows $11,000 at a periodic interest rate of 0.75% per month. He agrees to repay $335 per month. For how many FULL years will Joe have to make payments? 
(1)3 
(2)9 
(3)3 
(4)37","Answer: 1 Explanation: For this question, with a given monthly periodic rate, calculate how many years Joe will make payments. First, express the rate as a j12, then calculate N. Press Display .75 × 12 = I/YR 9 12  P/YR 12 11000 PV 11,000 335 +/ PMT 335 0 FV 0 N 37.837088 (months) ÷ 12 = 3.153091 (years) N is expressed as months; therefore, divide by 12 to express the amortization in years. Joe will have to make payments for three full years."
"Question 574: When casual reference is made to the current mortgage lending rate, the common practice is to quote: 
(1)effective annual interest rates. 
(2)nominal interest rates. 
(3)effective annual interest rates. 
(4)interest rates per compounding period.","Answer: 2 Explanation: Option (2) is correct because when mortgage interest rates are casually referenced, it is typically a nominal interest rate. Therefore, Options (1), (3), and (4) are incorrect."
"Question 575: Charlotte offered to sell her property to Dennis for $180,000 by email. Dennis emailed, “Send lowest cash price – will give $165,000 cash”. Charlotte replied, “Cannot reduce price”. Dennis then accepted the original offer but Charlotte refused to sell claiming that there was no contract. Which of the following statements is TRUE? 
(1)There is no contract because Charlotte’s reply was not a renewal of her original offer. 
(2)Charlotte’s reply to Dennis’ first wire was, in effect, a counter-offer on the same terms as her original offer. 
(3)There is no contract because Charlotte’s reply was not a renewal of her original offer. 
(4)Options (1) and (3) are both true.","Answer: 2 Explanation: Option (2) is correct because Charlotte effectively revived her original offer (to sell her property to Dennis for $180,000), which Dennis then accepted. Dennis’ offer of $165,000 was a counter-offer, which therefore terminated the original offer. However, Charlotte made her own counter-offer when she replied, “cannot reduce price”, which effectively renewed her original offer. Option (1) is incorrect because the case of Livingstone v. Evans tells us that the words “cannot reduce price”, uttered in this context, renew the original offer. Dennis was therefore entitled to accept the renewed offer. Option (3) is incorrect because Charlotte’s initial email contained the necessary terms (the property and the price) to constitute an offer capable of being accepted, and therefore was more than a mere invitation to treat. Option (4) is incorrect because Options (1) and (3) are both incorrect."
"Question 576: “A contract respecting land or a disposition of land is not enforceable unless there is, in writing signed by the party to be charged or by his agent, both an indication that it has been made and a reasonable indication of the subject matter...” The preceding is an extract from which statute? 
(1)Real Estate Services Act 
(2)Statute of Frauds 
(3)Real Estate Services Act 
(4)Law and Equity Act","Answer: 4 Explanation: Option (4) is correct because this extract is taken from section 59(3)(a) of the Law and Equity Act. Therefore, Options (1), (2), and (3) are incorrect."
"Question 577: Anna is interested in purchasing Elizabeth’s house. In an attempt to save money, instead of hiring a licensed home inspector, Anna thoroughly inspects Elizabeth’s house herself and does not find any defects or deficiencies. After the sale completes, Anna discovers a major issue with the foundation of the house that will cost $55,000 to fix. As a result, Anna sues Elizabeth for failing to disclose the issue with the foundation. Which of the following is TRUE? 
(1)Because the deficiency in the foundation is a major issue, Elizabeth is liable to Anna, even if she did not know about the defect. 
(2)Elizabeth would only be required to disclose this defect if Anna specifically asked about the foundation. 
(3)Because the deficiency in the foundation is a major issue, Elizabeth is liable to Anna, even if she did not know about the defect. 
(4)The foundation issue is known as a property stigma.","Answer: 3 Explanation: Option (3) is correct because if a qualified home inspector would have identified the issue, it would likely be classified as a patent defect, which sellers do not have an obligation to disclose. As a buyer, Anna has a duty to conduct a reasonable inspection and make reasonable inquiries to ensure that there are no patent defects, which typically involves consulting a licensed home inspector. Option (1) is incorrect because, even for major issues, the seller is only required to disclose latent defects that he or she knows or should have reasonably known. Option (2) is incorrect because sellers are required to disclose known latent defects that render the property dangerous or unfit for habitation, even if the buyer did not specifically ask about that defect. Option (4) is incorrect because the defect’s impact on the property can be objectively determined at a value of $55,000 and therefore cannot be classified as a stigma."
"Question 578: On June 1, Jem offered to buy Boo’s summer cottage for $230,000, and Boo accepted. Since the cottage was on a secluded island, neither party was aware that on May 30, the cottage was struck by lightning and completely destroyed by fire. Boo has no insurance and is seeking to enforce the contract. Which of the following statements is TRUE? 
(1)This is an example of mutual mistake and Jem can rescind the contract. 
(2)The doctrine of frustration applies here and both parties are relieved of their future obligations under the contract. 
(3)This is an example of mutual mistake and Jem can rescind the contract. 
(4)This is an example of common mistake and the contract is void.","Answer: 4 Explanation: Option (4) is correct because a common mistake occurs when both parties to a contract make the same mistake about a fundamental term of the contract, such as the existence of what is being sold. In this case, the fact that the cottage had been destroyed prior to the formation of the contract was unknown to both parties. The existence of a common mistake such as this renders a contract void. Option (1) is incorrect because a mutual mistake occurs when both parties make a fundamental mistake about the contract but each makes a different mistake. Here, the mistake was the same (the assumption that the cottage still existed). Option (2) is incorrect because frustration occurs where a specific thing that is necessary for the performance of the contract is no longer in existence at the time for performance. In this case, the cottage was destroyed before the contract was entered into, meaning that frustration does not apply. Option (3) is incorrect because (a) there is no indication that Jem did not understand the nature of the contract of sale; and (b) the mistake regarding the existence of the cottage was a common mistake, not a unilateral mistake since both Jem and Boo were mistaken."
"Question 579: Which of the following is a FALSE statement regarding the duties licensees owe to their clients under the Real Estate Services Rules? 
(1)The duty to act in the client’s best interests does not include taking actions that are unlawful. 
(2)The duty to act within the scope of authority given by the client does not include signing agreements for the client unless written permission is received. 
(3)The duty to act in the client’s best interests does not include taking actions that are unlawful. 
(4)The duty of full disclosure can include disclosing information a licensee may see as trivial.","Answer: 3 Explanation: Option (3) is correct because it is false. The duty of confidentiality to a client lasts forever. Option (1) is incorrect because actions that are unlawful would be against the duty of acting in the client’s best interest. Option (2) is incorrect because section 45 of the Real Estate Services Rules requires licensees to obtain written authorization to sign agreements on behalf of their clients. Option (4) is incorrect because full disclosure requires licensees disclose to their clients all known material information, no matter how trivial."
"Question 580: At common law and unless the agreement stipulates to the contrary, as soon as a contract is signed for the purchase and sale of real property, the risk of loss or damage suffered between the signing of the contract and the completion falls on: 
(1)the buyer. 
(2)the seller. 
(3)the buyer. 
(4)no one.","Answer: 1 Explanation: Option (1) is correct because one of the undesirable aspects of the common law pertaining to contracts is that when no mention of the state of title is made in the contract beneficial ownership, and therefore risk of loss or damage, passes to the buyer at the time the contract is signed. The standard form Contract of Purchase and Sale in BC expressly alters this common law presumption. Options (2), (3), and (4) are therefore incorrect."
"Question 581: What is the key purpose that is achieved when a licensee fulfills section 54 of the Rules and provides a consumer with a Disclosure of Representation in Trading Services form? 
(1)Informed consent 
(2)Undivided loyalty 
(3)Informed consent 
(4)Disclosure of interest in trade","Answer: 1 Explanation: Option (1) is correct because the key purpose of the Disclosure of Representation in Trading Services form is to ensure that consumers understand how trading services can be provided to them, so that they can provide informed consent to the chosen form of relationship with the real estate licensee. Options (2), (3), and (4) are incorrect for this reason."
"Question 582: You, as a trading services licensee working in a “hot” market, have recently listed a property for sale at $850,000. An offer of $840,000 was received at 8:30 this morning. At noon, a second offer of $845,000 was received and a third offer of $850,000 at 2:30 in the afternoon. You will be seeing the seller at 7:00 this evening. Which offer is to be presented? 
(1)All of the offers 
(2)The offer of $840,000 
(3)All of the offers 
(4)The offer of $850,000","Answer: 1 Explanation: Option (1) is correct because licensees have a duty to present all options to a client (which includes all offers) unless the client has given specific instructions to somehow limit which offers are to be presented. Options (2), (3), and (4) are incorrect because all three offers must be presented to your client."
"Question 583: A mortgage of the mortgagor’s equity of redemption is called: 
(1)a lien. 
(2)an equitable mortgage. 
(3)a lien. 
(4)a lease.","Answer: 2 Explanation: Option (2) is correct because a borrower who grants a legal mortgage retains an equitable interest in the property. The borrower is free to mortgage this equitable interest by granting a second, or subsequent, mortgage. These subsequent mortgages are mortgages on the borrower’s equity of redemption (the borrower’s right to repay the mortgage and redeem title to the property). Option (1) is incorrect because, though also a form of security interest, a lien is not a mortgage. Options (3) and (4) are incorrect because agreements for sale and leases are not mortgages."
"Question 584: The Court Order usually obtained first in a foreclosure action is an: 
(1)order nisi. 
(2)order absolute. 
(3)order nisi. 
(4)order for specific performance.","Answer: 1 Explanation: Option (1) is correct because, at the first court appearance where a claim for foreclosure is brought, a judge will generally grant an order nisi. The order nisi is an important preliminary step because it sets the final redemption period, during which the respondents can redeem the mortgage by paying the amount due and owing. Options (2) and (3) are incorrect because orders absolute and orders for sale may be obtained if payment is not made within the redemption period set by the order nisi. Option (4) is incorrect because an order for specific performance may be available in the case of an agreement for sale, but is not an available remedy for foreclosure actions."
"Question 585: Which one of the following is a liability on a financial statement? 
(1)Accumulated depreciation 
(2)Mortgages payable 
(3)Accumulated depreciation 
(4)Prepaid expense","Answer: 2 Explanation: Option (2) is correct because mortgages payable represents a debt that must be repaid. Option (1) is incorrect because accumulated depreciation is part of the assets section on the balance sheet, and takes away from the value of the depreciable asset(s). Options (3) and (4) are incorrect because wages paid is listed as an expense, and prepaid expenses are listed as a current asset."
"Question 586: Which of the following options is inconsistent with generally accepted accounting principles? 
(1)Expenses directly associated with particular revenues are recognized at the time they are incurred. 
(2)Assets are revalued upwards to account for the effect of inflation. 
(3)Expenses directly associated with particular revenues are recognized at the time they are incurred. 
(4)Revenues are recognized at the time they are earned.","Answer: 2 Explanation: Option (2) is correct because revaluing assets is inconsistent with the cost principle. Option (1) is consistent with the matching principle, Option (3) is consistent with the consistency principle, and Option (4) is consistent with the revenue recognition principle."
"Question 587: The secondary mortgage market: 
(1)occurs when a borrower receives funds secured by a mortgage from a bank. 
(2)is the market in which existing mortgages are bought and sold as financial investments. 
(3)occurs when a borrower receives funds secured by a mortgage from a bank. 
(4)is the market in which mortgage loans are initiated.","Answer: 2 Explanation: Option (2) is correct because a secondary mortgage market is the market in which existing mortgages are bought and sold between investors. Options (1), (3), and (4) are incorrect."
"Question 588: An investor wants to decide whether to buy a mortgage written for $100,000 at j12 = 3.5% that calls for monthly payments, a 20-year amortization, and a 5-year term. If the investor can earn j12 = 6% with other investments, at what price should the mortgage be purchased? 
(1)$80,951.26 
(2)$110,669.93 
(3)$80,951.26 
(4)$89,602.21","Answer: 3 Explanation: If the investor can earn j12 = 6% on other investments, the purchase price of the mortgage should be based on a market value of j12 = 6%. First, calculate the mortgage payment based on the contract rate of j12 = 3.5%. Since this question also has a 5-year term, calculate the outstanding balance at the end of the 5-year term and set this amount equal to the future value with N equal to 60.

(1)rapid inflation. 
(2)the federal government’s desire to stimulate the demand for and supply of housing after World War II. 
(3)rapid inflation. 
(4)principal risk.","Answer: 4 Explanation: Option (4) is correct because constant payment loans were developed in response to the risk to the lender of default on principal. The constant payment reduces this risk as each periodic payment reduces the amount of principal at risk. Options (1), (2), and (3) are incorrect."
"Question 590: The appraisal of condominium units using the market comparison approach has some distinct differences from the appraisal of other types of real property. Which one of the following factors might be applicable to condominiums ONLY? 
(1)Location and neighbourhood 
(2)Quality of construction 
(3)Location and neighbourhood 
(4)Interest rate on the mortgage","Answer: 3 Explanation: Option (3) is correct because common area charges could be applicable to condominiums only, as condominiums consist of a tenancy in common interest in the common areas of the development, while some other types of real property do not. Options (1), (2), and (4) are incorrect because location and neighbourhood, quality of construction, and the interest rate on the mortgage are applicable to all types of property, not just condominiums."

"Question 592: A mortgage broker has helped you set up a mortgage loan. The loan is for $350,000 at an interest rate of j12 = 4.75% and a 20-year amortization. The loan calls for monthly payments of $2,262 over a 2-year term with $327,975.95 owing at the end of 2 years.

(1)increasing the amortization period. 
(2)reducing the monthly payments. 
(3)increasing the amortization period. 
(4)reducing the debt coverage ratio.","Answer: 3 Explanation: Option (3) is correct because reducing the loan-to-value ratio is the only option listed that the mortgagee can ensure there is sufficient security against the loan. Options (1), (2), and (4) are incorrect because a longer amortization period, smaller monthly payment, or lower debt coverage ratio will not guarantee sufficient security against the loan or that the borrowers are in a financial position that will enable them to make the necessary payments."
"Question 597: Jake wants to purchase a house that is listed for $276,000. The bank’s appraiser estimates that the lending value of the property is $275,000. Jake’s gross annual income is $50,000 per year. The bank applies an 80% loan-to-value ratio and a gross debt service ratio of 32%. Property taxes amount to $1,800 per year. Assume that the lender demands a 25-year amortization period and monthly payments at a contract rate of j2 = 4.2%. The government-specified qualifying rate is 5.25% per annum, compounded semi-annually. How much can Jake borrow, given the stress test borrower qualification rules for uninsured mortgages?

The loan-to-value is calculated based on the bank’s appraisal of the property. In this case, the amount the bank appraises the property at is $275,000. Once the payments from the GDSR are calculated, the PV of the loan is calculated, taking into consideration the stress test qualification rules.

"Question 599: Jennifer Joseph has lived alone in an apartment since the death of her husband 10 years ago. She has just turned 60 years of age, retired from her job as a bus driver, and wants to begin gardening as a hobby to fill in her retirement years. She has found a small house that is selling at a price she can afford because it is the only residential property in an area of commercial development. The present owners, who are anxious to sell, have lived in the house for about 20 years and have developed a magnificent garden, which appeals very much to Mrs. Joseph; however, she is worried about having enough retirement income to meet the mortgage payments and the property tax payments if she uses all of her savings as a down payment. Which one of the following statements is TRUE? 
(1)Mrs. Joseph should apply for a reverse annuity mortgage (RAM) because a RAM will require lower mortgage payments than a conventional mortgage. 
(2)After Mrs. Joseph’s purchase, the property will continue to have an assessed value for real property tax purposes, which is based on its value as a residential property. 
(3)Mrs. Joseph should apply for a reverse annuity mortgage (RAM) because a RAM will require lower mortgage payments than a conventional mortgage. 
(4)If Mrs. Joseph becomes an owner-occupier, the home owner grants will allow reduction of her taxes to no more than $350.","Answer: 3 Explanation: Option (3) is correct because British Columbia’s regular tax deferral program will allow Mrs. Joseph to make an application to defer up to 100% of the net property taxes payable on the property, since it will be here principal place of residence. Assuming that Mrs. Joseph is either a Canadian citizen or a permanent resident, and that she would have a minimum equity of 25% in the property if she purchased it, she would likely qualify for the regular program given that she is both 55 and a widow. Option (1) is incorrect because a reverse annuity mortgage is a type of mortgage that can function to supplement the income of aged persons who already own their home, not as a way to reduce mortgage payments where a new home is being purchased. Option (2) is incorrect because the property is the only residential property in an area of commercial development. While section 19(8) of the Assessment Act permits certain residential properties to be assessed according to the value based solely on their current residential use, Mrs. Joseph would not qualify for this special assessment because she has not lived continuously in the residence for ten years. Option (4) is incorrect because Mrs. Joseph would only qualify for the basic home owner grant, which cannot be used to reduce total property taxes below $350.00."

(2)A soft change to the metric standard of measurement 
(3)A hard change to the metric standard of measurement 
(4)A continuation of the current imperial standard of measurement","Answer: 1 Explanation: Option (1) is the correct answer as a hard change is the establishment of a new metric standard size, such as 150mm. Options (2), (3), and (4) are incorrect."

(1)Convection 
(2)Combustion 
(3)Convection 
(4)Radiation","Answer: 1 Explanation: Option (1) is correct because convection heat transfer occurs when the baseboard heating unit warms the air in the room. As the air around the baseboard unit warms, the warmer air rises and cooler air falls, creating a convective current in the room. Options (2), (3), and (4) are incorrect as they do not describe the principal way that such a heating system provides most of its heat transfer."

"Question 603: You have a partially completed appraisal report that you need to fill in. The 2,400 square foot subject property has 4 bedrooms. The house next door is similar in all respects except for the number of bedrooms and square footage. The 2,500 square foot comparable sold for $225,800 and has 3 bedrooms. If the market value of a bedroom is $3,200 and above an 1,800 sq. ft. benchmark, each 100 sq. ft. is worth $6,000, it can be concluded that the adjusted sale price of this comparable is: 
(1)$228,600 
(2)$216,600 
(3)$228,600 
(4)$235,000","Answer: 3 Explanation: To find the adjusted sale price of the comparable, take the sum of the listed sale price with its adjustments to the subject property. In this case, the subject property and the comparable are identical except that the subject property has 1 additional bedroom and 100 square feet less. The adjusted sale price is: $225,800 + $3,200 –$6,000 = $223,000."
"Question 604: In the comparative approach, it is MOST important that the subject building and the comparable buildings be: 
(1)recently constructed of average quality construction. 
(2)of the same general architectural style. 
(3)recently constructed of average quality construction. 
(4)inclusive of similar types and quality of fixtures.","Answer: 3 Explanation: Option (3) is correct because in the comparative approach of appraisal, it is most important that the subject building and the comparable buildings be similar with respect to factors judged important by buyers and sellers. Options (1), (2), and (4) are incorrect because similarity is only required for those factors that have a major influence on buyers and sellers, and the sale prices they negotiate."
"Question 605: If the cost of developing houses is greater than their market value, what will occur in the short run? 
(1)Costs will decrease. 
(2)Market value will increase. 
(3)Costs will decrease. 
(4)The style of new housing will be changed to reflect the increased costs.","Answer: 3 Explanation: Option (3) is correct because if the cost of developing houses is greater than their market value, development will stop in the short run until market values rise. Options (1), (2), and (4) are incorrect because they do not describe the short run effects of an increase in the cost of developing houses."

(2)Vacancy rates must be those existing at the time of the appraisal for the subject property. 
(3)Vacancy rates are expressed as a percentage of gross potential revenue. 
(4)Vacancy rates must be deducted from gross potential revenue.","Answer: 2 Explanation: Option (2) is correct (false) because the vacancy allowance should be determined by the long-term vacancy rates in the area; that is, the vacancies in comparable buildings modified, if necessary, by expected future trends. Options (1), (3), and (4) are incorrect because they are true."
"Question 608: Which one of the following is termed functional incurable depreciation in a building? 
(1)Worn carpeting 
(2)No air conditioning 
(3)Worn carpeting

"Question 609: Which of the following is NOT an effective way for a licensee to communicate the value of their services in a listing presentation? 
(1)Pay attention to details in the presentation, as this can provide evidence of performance. 
(2)Refrain from discussing the marketing program for the property, as this is considered proprietary information. 
(3)Pay attention to details in the presentation, as this can provide evidence of performance. 
(4)Clearly spell out the services and benefits that are being offered.","Answer: 2 Explanation: Option (2) is the correct answer: explaining the marketing program during a listing presentation will help a client understand what benefits the licensee is providing.

(1)Forms software 
(2)Back office management software

"Question 611: To qualify for a managing broker’s licence in British Columbia, a person must meet which of the following requirements? 
(1)Submit personal financial statements for each licensee they intend to hire 
(2)Have provided real estate services within British Columbia or an equivalent jurisdiction for 2 out of the 5 years preceding the application 
(3)Submit personal financial statements for each licensee they intend to hire 
(4)All of the above","Answer: 2 Explanation: Option (2) is correct because a licensee is required to meet the educational and experience requirement appropriate to the level of licence for which the application is made. In addition to meeting the educational requirements for a representative licence, to qualify for a managing broker’s licence, a person must have been providing real estate services British Columbia or an equivalent jurisdiction for at least two years during the five years before the date of the application. Option (1) is incorrect because, while brokerages are required to keep certain specified financial records (section 25 of RESA), persons applying for managing broker’s licences do not need to submit personal financial statements for each licensee they intend to hire. Option (3) is incorrect because, as mentioned previously, an applicant’s licensed experience can come from British Columbia or an equivalent jurisdiction. Option (4) is incorrect because Options (1) and (3) are incorrect."
"Question 612: Alan recently assisted Peter in the sale of Peter’s house. What are the legal consequences of his doing so? 
(1)Unless he is licensed, Alan has breached the Real Estate Services Act. 
(2)If Alan is unlicensed, but performed the service without receiving or expecting any money or reward, he has done nothing wrong. 
(3)Unless he is licensed, Alan has breached the Real Estate Services Act. 
(4)If Alan is unlicensed, but he is Peter’s brother, Peter can pay him for the work and no breach has occurred.","Answer: 2 Explanation: Option (2) is correct because the Real Estate Services Act requires that a person who provides “real estate services” on behalf of another for or in expectation of remuneration must be licensed. There is no licensing requirement for persons like Alan, who perform real estate services without receiving or expecting any money or reward. Option (1) is incorrect for the same reason. Option (3) is incorrect because “real estate services” are not limited to the writing of the contract of purchase and sale. The Real Estate Services Act defines “real estate services” as including actions such as advising on the appropriate price for real estate, making representations about a property, finding a party to acquire real estate, showing the real estate, and negotiating the price of real estate. Therefore, Alan may not perform any of these services (or any other service included in the definition of “trading services”) and receive money for it. Option (4) is incorrect because siblings are not exempt from the licensing requirement established by section 3 of the Real Estate Services Act. Therefore, if Alan is unlicensed, Peter cannot pay him for providing real estate services."
"Question 613: Which of the following statements regarding joint tenancy is FALSE? 
(1)Where a husband and wife own property in joint tenancy and one of them dies, the other becomes the owner of the whole interest. 
(2)Where a joint tenant transfers their interest to a third party, the third party becomes a tenant in common with the original joint tenant. 
(3)Where a husband and wife own property in joint tenancy and one of them dies, the other becomes the owner of the whole interest. 
(4)A joint tenancy becomes a tenancy in common upon severance.","Answer: 3 Explanation: Option (3) is correct because there is no right of survivorship in a tenancy in common. Therefore, where two people own property as tenants in common, they each may leave their interest by will to whomever they wish. Option (1) is incorrect because the essential feature of joint tenancy is the right of survivorship. This means that when one joint tenant dies, the property automatically vests in the surviving joint tenant(s). Option (2) is incorrect because all joint tenants must receive their interests at the same time and from the same document. Therefore, if one joint tenant transfers his interest to a third party, both the unity of time and the unity of title are destroyed, and the co-ownership is converted to a tenancy in common. Option (4) is incorrect for the same reason."
"Question 614: Under the Torrens System of land registration in British Columbia, if property is registered in favour of a trustee, this is shown by which of the following? 
(1)Registering a caveat against the title 
(2)Registering a lis pendens against the title 
(3)Registering a caveat against the title 
(4)Issuing the trustee a duplicate certificate of title","Answer: 3 Explanation: Option (3) is correct because British Columbia does not have a pure Torrens system of title registration, and therefore allows a notation of trust to be made on the title. In a pure Torrens system, no mention of a trust can appear on the register. Option (1) is incorrect because a caveat is a short-term notice registered against a title to land warning those looking at the title that a claim for an estate or interest in the property has been made. Option (2) is incorrect because a lis pendens is a term previously used for what is now called a certificate of pending litigation. Option (4) is incorrect because issuing a duplicate certificate of title does nothing to show that the property is registered in favour of a trustee."
"Question 615: Mark, an experienced real estate licensee, showed a home in Lion’s Bay to John, who was a first-time home buyer. John asked Mark whether the house had termites. It was located in forested area and John told Mark that he was afraid that this location might have termite infestation problems. Mark told him that there were no termite infestation problems in the house. After the sale was completed, John discovered that the house had a serious termite problem, which would cost a considerable amount to repair. On what grounds might Mark be liable to John in a lawsuit? 
(1)Occupier’s liability 
(2)Private nuisance 
(3)Occupier’s liability 
(4)Vicarious liability","Answer: 3 Explanation: Option (3) is correct because the four requirements for an action for negligent misrepresentation are met: (1) Mark made an untrue statement when he told John that there was no termite problem; (2) the statement was likely negligent because, assuming that Mark was not outright lying, he failed to ascertain the necessary information regarding the termites before telling John that there was no infestation; (3) as an experienced professional giving advice to a person (John) who would reasonably rely on that advice, Mark owed John a duty of care; and (4) given the position of Mark, a real estate licensee showing a home, it was likely reasonable for John to rely on Mark’s statement. Since these four elements are likely met, Mark is likely liable to John for the repairs on the grounds of negligent misrepresentation. Option (1) is incorrect because John did not suffer loss while Mark was showing him the home. Option (2) is incorrect because private nuisance occurs where an owner or occupier of land unreasonably or substantially interferes with the reasonable use and enjoyment of a neighbouring property. Option (4) is incorrect because vicarious liability is the principle that renders employers liable for wrongful acts committed by their employees. In this case, vicarious liability may render Mark’s real estate brokerage liable for his negligent misrepresentation."
"Question 616: Which of the following statements is TRUE with respect to security deposits in a commercial tenancy? 
(1)The interest that accrues on a security deposit is always paid to the account of the landlord. 
(2)Someone who purchases the property from the landlord is obligated to repay the security deposit to the tenant. 
(3)The interest that accrues on a security deposit is always paid to the account of the landlord. 
(4)All of the above","Answer: 3 Explanation: Option (3) is correct because there are no legal restrictions regarding security deposits in commercial tenancies. This amount is left open to negotiation. Option (1) is incorrect because the allocation of interest on security deposits in commercial tenancies is open for negotiation, and therefore may be allocated to the tenant. Additionally, the Residential Tenancy Act and the Residential Tenancy Regulation require that the landlord pay interest on a security deposit to the tenant upon termination of the tenancy. Option (2) is incorrect because, in commercial tenancies, the return of a security deposit is a personal obligation of the landlord. A purchaser is under no duty to the tenant to repay it. In residential tenancies a security deposit, and the obligation of the landlord to repay it (with interest), runs with the land. Therefore, assuming the tenancy continues after the property is transferred, the purchaser will be required to pay these amounts out to the tenant when the tenancy ends. Option (4) is incorrect because Options (1) and (2) are incorrect."
"Question 617: Which of the following statements about bare land strata developments is TRUE? 
(1)A typical way for a developer to ensure that the houses built within the strata lots have a uniform appearance is through a series of corresponding easement agreements affecting each lot. 
(2)Within a bare land strata development, title to the roads is always transferred to the local municipality on completion, so that the municipality will be responsible for the costs of maintenance and repairs. 
(3)A typical way for a developer to ensure that the houses built within the strata lots have a uniform appearance is through a series of corresponding easement agreements affecting each lot. 
(4)The owners of bare land strata lots will be responsible for the costs associated with the common property of the development, which may include outdoor recreational facilities such as lakes or trails.","Answer: 4 Explanation: Option (4) is correct because the owners in a bare land strata development will be responsible for any costs associated with common property. Recreational facilities are frequently built as common property on a bare land strata development. Option (1) is incorrect because uniform appearance is typically ensured through registered building schemes and strata bylaws, rather than easement agreements. Option (2) is incorrect because title to the land on which roads are placed can be retained by the strata corporation as common property, such that the owners of the strata lots would be responsible for maintenance and repair. Option (3) is incorrect because bare land strata developments, aside from being for residential and recreational development, are often also used for industrial and commercial development."
"Question 618: Which of the following is/are TRUE regarding listing contracts? 
(1)The purchaser can rely on the terms in the listing contract. 
(2)The listing contract must be signed by all persons who have an ownership interest in the property being sold. 
(3)The purchaser can rely on the terms in the listing contract. 
(4)All of the above","Answer: 2 Explanation: Option (2) is correct because, if a property is to be listed and then sold, all persons who have an ownership interest in the property must agree to the listing. Therefore, it is essential that the listing contract is signed by all of the owners. Option (1) is incorrect because the purchaser is not party to the listing contract, and therefore cannot rely on any of the terms within it. Option (3) is incorrect because a licensee who does not review the title of the listed property assumes the risk of liability to the purchaser, loss of commission, and disciplinary proceedings if a complaint is registered with the British Columbia Financial Services Authority. This remains true even if the licensee includes terms such as “approximately” or “more or less” when describing a property. Option (4) is incorrect because Options (1) and (3) are incorrect."
"Question 619: An agent will be personally liable to third parties: 
(1)whenever the agent contracts on behalf of a principal. 
(2)where the agent fails to disclose that they are an agent. 
(3)whenever the agent contracts on behalf of a principal. 
(4)in all of the above circumstances.","Answer: 2 Explanation: Option (2) is correct because at common law there are three situations where an agent will be personally liable to a third party. One of these situations is where the agent fails to disclose that he/she is an agent. Option (1) is incorrect because an agent will generally not be personally liable to third parties provided that the agent: (a) discloses their status as an agent; (b) has authority to act as an agent; and (c) does not commit any torts. Option (3) is incorrect because an agent may be granted authority from the principal orally, or by implication in certain cases. In either of these situations, the agent will possess legitimate authority and will not be personally liable to third parties merely for the reason do not have written authority. Option (4) is incorrect because Options (1) and (3) are incorrect."
"Question 620: Victoria has agreed to sell her home to Penny for $140,000. Property taxes of $2,300 have been assessed and were paid in full by Victoria on July 15. There is an outstanding late payment penalty of $85, which Victoria has not yet paid. The adjustment and possession date is December 28. It is NOT a leap year. Penny’s share of the property taxes will appear on her own statement of adjustments as: 
(1)a credit of $25.21. 
(2)a credit of $18.90. 
(3)a credit of $25.21. 
(4)a debit of $18.90.","Answer: 3 Explanation: Option (3) is correct because, since Victoria (the seller) has already paid the full year’s property taxes, Penny (the buyer) should reimburse Victoria for the portion of the taxes from and including the adjustment date up to the end of the year. In this case, Penny’s share of the year’s property taxes (Dec. 28 – Dec. 31 = 4 days) is calculated in the following manner: 4/365 × $2,300 = $25.21. This amount will appear as a debit on Penny’s statement of adjustments. The late payment penalty incurred by Victoria will not be reflected on Penny’s statement of adjustments because it was Victoria’s responsibility to pay the property taxes on time. Therefore, Options (1), (2), and (4) are incorrect."

In addition, she has obtained $92,000 in new mortgage financing from her bank. Conveyancing fees of $690 and a mortgage administration fee of $250 are payable by Peggy. Vivian is paying a 6% real estate commission to her real estate brokerage. The adjustment and possession date is December 28. Vivian has agreed to take back a short term mortgage in the amount of $8,000 in order to help Peggy finance the purchase. In addition, the conveyancer will be discharging the existing mortgage on title, which has an outstanding balance of $12,000. Finally, property taxes of $2,300 have been assessed and were paid in full by Vivian on July 15. These taxes are to be adjusted between the parties. There is an outstanding late payment penalty of $85, which Vivian has not yet paid. No one is entitled to a home owner grant, and, as no exemptions apply, Peggy will be responsible for paying the property transfer tax on completion. Assume that it is NOT a leap year and Peggy is NOT a foreign entity for property transfer tax purposes. The cash proceeds of the sale which will be received by Vivian are:

"Question 622: Valentina has agreed to sell her home to Petra for $140,000. Petra has saved up $15,000, which she paid to her brokerage as a deposit. The deposit will appear: 
(1)as a debit on Petra’s statement and a credit on Valentina’s statement. 
(2)as a credit on Petra’s statement only. 
(3)as a debit on Petra’s statement and a credit on Valentina’s statement. 
(4)as a credit on Petra’s statement and a debit on Valentina’s statement.","Answer: 2 Explanation: Option (2) is correct. When a deposit is paid to a real estate brokerage, the amount of the deposit will be reflected on the buyer’s statement of adjustments as a credit. It will not appear on the seller’s statement of adjustments, therefore Options (1), (3), and (4) are incorrect."
"Question 623: Bernadette has agreed to purchase Steve’s home for $438,000. However, before the sale completes, she discovers that she has been the subject of an innocent misrepresentation that materially affects the contract. Bernadette may go to court and ask for the application of which of the following legal principles? 
(1)Revocation 
(2)Rectification 
(3)Revocation 
(4)None of the above","Answer: 3 Explanation: Option (3) is correct because, where a contract has not been executed, the available remedy for innocent misrepresentation is rescission (cancellation of the contract). Option (1) is incorrect because revocation refers to the cancellation of an offer. Once a contract has been made, revocation is no longer available. Option (2) is incorrect because rectification is a remedy typically available where there has been a mistake leading to the formation of a contract, not for misrepresentation. Option (4) is incorrect because Option (3) is correct."
"Question 624: On January 1, Abdul placed an advertisement on CQXR radio station offering squash lessons for $30 per hour. Lois heard the ad and phoned Abdul on January 3 and said “I want to take squash lessons but I’m a student, do you give a lower rate to students?” Abdul said that he only had one rate of $30 per hour. Lois said she would phone back. On January 5, Lois phoned Abdul and said she accepted Abdul’s offer. Which of the following statements concerning Abdul and Lois is true? 
(1)The January 1 advertisement was an offer, which Lois accepted on January 5. 
(2)The January 1 advertisement was an offer and Lois’ telephone call on January 3 was a counter-offer. 
(3)The January 1 advertisement was an offer, which Lois accepted on January 5. 
(4)Lois’ January 3 call was a counter-offer and Abdul’s response on January 3 was a second counteroffer.","Answer: 3 Explanation: Option (3) is correct because, in the context of Lois’ inquiry regarding the possibility of a lower rate, Abdul statement that his rate was $30 per hour was an offer. This was a valid offer because it contained the necessary terms for a contract to be entered into; in this case, price ($30 per hour) and subject matter (squash lessons). Option (1) is incorrect because the advertisement was most likely an invitation to treat, used by Abdul to induce radio listeners to pursue a contract for tennis lessons with him. Option (2) is incorrect for the same reason, and for the reason that Lois’ call was merely an inquiry regarding the possibility of a lower rate for students. Lois did not propose a new rate, therefore, he did not make a counter-offer. Option (4) is incorrect for the same reason."
"Question 625: Which of the following statements regarding limited partnerships is TRUE? 
(1)Each limited partner is personally liable for all debts that the partnership incurs. 
(2)A limited partner can actively be engaged in managing the business without any consequences to their partnership status. 
(3)Each limited partner is personally liable for all debts that the partnership incurs. 
(4)There must be one or more general partners.","Answer: 4 Explanation: Option (4) is correct because there must be at least one general partner in a limited partnership. The general partner(s) have unlimited liability, and can engage in the management or operations of the partnership. Options (1), (2), and (3) are all incorrect statements."
"Question 626: In a single-storey house, joists are horizontal framing members that support which of the following? 
(1)Rafters 
(2)The foundation only 
(3)Rafters 
(4)The foundation and ceilings",Answer: 3 Explanation: Option (3) is correct because joists are the horizontal framing members that support the floors. Option (1) is incorrect because joists do not support rafters. Options (2) and (4) are incorrect as the foundation is the poured concrete footprint that supports the superstructure above.
"Question 627: Which of the following situations are consistent with the existence of a joint tenancy under current British Columbia law? 
(1)Herman was a co-owner of Blueacre. When Herman died, the surviving co-owners of Blueacre automatically became its only co-owners. 
(2)Joan and Anna are co-owners of Greenacre. The document transferring the property to them does not expressly state how they hold the property or what interest each owns. 
(3)Herman was a co-owner of Blueacre. When Herman died, the surviving co-owners of Blueacre automatically became its only co-owners. 
(4)Bert and Ernest are co-owners of Whiteacre. The front half of the property is Bert’s and the back half is owned by Ernest.","Answer: 1 Explanation: Option (1) is correct because an essential feature of joint tenancy is the right of survivorship. This means that when one joint tenant dies, the entire estate automatically vests in the surviving joint tenants. Option (2) is incorrect because, in British Columbia, the default form of co-ownership is tenancy in common, not joint tenancy. This means that if a document transfers a property without expressly stating the type of co-ownership, the new owners will be presumed to hold the property as tenants in common. Option (3) is incorrect because Paul severed the joint tenancy when he transferred his interest to his son and registered it at the land title office. This act converted the co-ownership of the property into a tenancy in common. Option (4) is incorrect because joint tenants enjoy a unity of possession, meaning that each co-owner is entitled to possession of the whole of the estate and no joint tenant can hold possession of any part separately and to the exclusion of others."

"Question 629: Three years ago Jim bought a house, at which time he arranged a mortgage for $120,000. The loan was written at a rate of 6.75% per annum compounded semi-annually, calling for monthly payments of $822.06 and an outstanding balance of $108,904.49 due at the end of the 5-year term. Jim has just received an offer from Alice to buy his house. Alice’s offer consists of $25,000 cash and assumption of the existing financing for the remainder of the term. If current lending rates for 2-year term mortgages are 8.75% per annum, compounded semi-annually, what is the market value of Alice’s offer?

"Question 632: A borrower who makes accelerated biweekly payments: 
(1)will make a smaller number of payments in a calendar year than a borrower who makes constant monthly payments (all other loan terms being equal). 
(2)will pay more interest over the life of the loan than a borrower who makes constant monthly payments (all other loan terms being equal). 
(3)will make a smaller number of payments in a calendar year than a borrower who makes constant monthly payments (all other loan terms being equal). 
(4)pays one-half of the monthly payment every two weeks.","Answer: 4 Explanation: Option (4) is correct because the accelerated biweekly payment is calculated as the monthly payment divided in half; instead of paying once a month, one-half of the monthly payment is paid every two weeks. Since the effect of the accelerated biweekly payments allows the borrower to make the equivalent of one extra monthly payment, the borrower will pay less interest over the loan and make a larger number of payments in a calendar year than with a constant monthly repayment schedule. Option (1) is incorrect because the borrower will make more monthly payments in a calendar year than a borrower who makes constant monthly payments. Option (2) is incorrect because the borrower will pay less interest over the life of the loan than a borrower who makes constant monthly payments. Option (3) is incorrect because the borrower pays one-half of the monthly payment every two weeks. This amounts to one-twenty-fourth of the annual payment, since one-twelfth of the annual payment is equivalent to the monthly payment."

(1)comparing all rents for similar space. 
(2)comparing rents for recently leased similar space. 
(3)comparing all rents for similar space. 
(4)totalling current rents in the subject building.","Answer: 2 Explanation: Option (2) is correct because when estimating gross potential rents, the appraiser should have a sound knowledge of the current market rents for various types of accommodation, as gross potential rent is estimated using the market rents for recently leased similar space. Options (1), (3), and (4) are therefore incorrect."
"Question 634: You are determining the market value of a subject property using the capitalization process.

"Question 635: Which of the following refers to communication with employees, stockholders, clients, and the general public, with the aim of enhancing the image and reputation of a business? 
(1)Sales promotion 
(2)Undifferentiated marketing 
(3)Sales promotion 
(4)Target theory","Answer: 3 Explanation: Option (3) is correct because public relations refers to communications (other than personal selling and advertising) for the purpose of enhancing the image, recognition, and reputation of the firm. These communications can be with employees, stockholders, clients, and the general public. Option (1) is incorrect because sales promotion refers to any form of non-personal selling that does not fall under the head of public relations, advertising, or publicity. Option (2) is incorrect because undifferentiated marketing is a practice of marketing a product or service, not enhancing the general image and reputation of a business. Option (4) is incorrect because target theory is concerned with which group(s) a business focuses their marketing efforts on, and does not directly involve enhancing the general image and reputation of the business."

(1)Land that is reasonably necessary for the use and enjoyment of the complex as a place of residence 
(2)A detached home in which a family resides 
(3)Land that is reasonably necessary for the use and enjoyment of the complex as a place of residence 
(4)A home that is used for short-term rentals on Airbnb","Answer: 4 Explanation: Option (4) is correct because, although the definition of a residential complex includes most dwelling-units, a home which is used for short-term rentals would likely be considered a dwelling unit akin to a hotel, and thus would be excluded from the definition of a residential complex under the Excise Tax Act. Option (1) is incorrect because the residential complex definition includes land that is reasonably necessary for the use and enjoyment of the complex as a place of residence. Options (2) and (3) are incorrect because the definition of residential complex includes detached homes and condominiums used as dwelling houses which do not fall under the “hotel” exception."
"Question 638: Your client, Bard, is a developer who owns land in an area zoned for single family residences. He wants to subdivide his 2.5 acre lot and build two 24 unit condominium projects on the land. Bard seeks your expert advice about how to overcome the land use bylaw obstacles that could prohibit the land development. You correctly advise Bard that: 
(1)Bard will have to apply for a legal non-conforming use permit for this development site, according to the process outlined in the Local Government Act. 
(2)a public hearing must be held by the municipal council prior to a change in the permitted land use or density under a zoning bylaw. 
(3)Bard will have to apply for a legal non-conforming use permit for this development site, according to the process outlined in the Local Government Act. 
(4)All of the above statements are true.","Answer: 2 Explanation: Option (2) is correct because, in order to subdivide his lot and build two condominium projects, Bard will need the municipal council or regional district to pass a new bylaw amending the current zoning bylaw. To pass a bylaw changing the permitted use or density of the zone, a public hearing must be held to give persons whose interest in property would be affected an opportunity to be heard. Option (1) is incorrect because a legal non-conforming use refers to land use that is impermissible under current zoning restrictions, but which is nevertheless lawful because the use existed lawfully before the restrictions took effect. One cannot apply for a legal non-conforming use exemption for the purposes of converting a property to a use currently prohibited by an existing bylaw. Option (3) is incorrect because, in order to further change the use or density of a zone, the municipal council must hold another public hearing. Option (4) is incorrect because Options (1) and (3) are incorrect."
"Question 639: There are several steps taken before a lawsuit actually is brought before a judge. Which of the following procedures does NOT take place before a trial begins? 
(1)Filing and serving a notice of civil claim 
(2)Filing and serving a response to civil claim 
(3)Filing and serving a notice of civil claim 
(4)Obtaining a garnishing order","Answer: 4 Explanation: Option (4) is correct because a garnishing order may only be obtained either during or after a lawsuit (depending on the circumstances), but never before the lawsuit has been brought before a judge. Option (1) is incorrect because a notice of civil claim outlines the details of a plaintiff’s claim, and is served to the defendant before the claim is actually brought before a judge. Option (2) is incorrect because a response to civil claim is the defendant’s initial written reply to the notice of civil claim, and it is also filed and served before the claim is brought before a judge. Option (3) is incorrect because discovery proceedings are a means for bringing out the relevant evidence before the case gets to trial."
"Question 640: All other things being equal, the type of loan with the most risk to the lender is: 
(1)an interest accruing loan. 
(2)an interest only loan. 
(3)an interest accruing loan. 
(4)a constant, blended payment loan.","Answer: 1 Explanation: Option (1) is correct because with an interest accruing loan, the lender receives no payments before the maturity of the loan. This means that the entire loan amount and the interest accrued is at risk throughout the entire term of the loan, making it the most risky of the four types of loans in this question, all other things being equal. Option (2) is incorrect because an interest only loan is less risky because the borrower contracts to make regular payments of the interest earned to the lender throughout the term of the loan. Options (3) and (4) are incorrect because, with both of these loans, the lender receives periodic payments of both the principal amount and interest throughout the term of the loan."
"Question 641: Assume that it is not a leap year. A property is sold on the following terms: Price: $195,000 (cash) Commission: 5% on the first $100,000 of the sale price and 2½% on the balance. Adjustment, possession, and completion date: August 28. Taxes for the current year were paid by the seller on July 1 in the amount of $1,015. The buyer has paid a deposit of $20,000 legal fees for the conveyance amount to $491. Where would the tax adjustment appear on the Statements of Adjustment? 
(1)As a credit on the Seller’s Statement and a debit on the Buyer’s Statement 
(2)As a credit on the Buyer’s Statement and a debit on the Seller’s Statement 
(3)As a credit on the Seller’s Statement and a debit on the Buyer’s Statement 
(4)As a debit on both statements","Answer: 1 Explanation: Option (1) is correct because property taxes are paid on July 1, therefore, they have been paid by the seller. When property taxes have been paid by the seller, the buyer should reimburse the seller for that portion of the year from and including the adjustment date. The tax adjustment will appear as a credit on the seller’s statement and a debit on the buyer’s statement. Options (2), (3), and (4) are therefore incorrect."

(1)The licensee must disclose that they, or an associated company or partnership, are purchasing the property on their own behalf. 
(2)The licensee must disclose that they, or an associated company or partnership, are selling their own property. 
(3)The licensee must disclose that they, or an associated company or partnership, are purchasing the property on their own behalf. 
(4)The licensee must make the required disclosure in writing, in the required form, prior to entering into any agreement.","Answer: 3 Explanation: Option (3) is correct because the British Columbia Real Estate Services Act does not require licensees to disclose any other properties that they are considering.

(1)real estate prices are increasing very quickly. 
(2)the seller is not in a hurry to sell. 
(3)real estate prices are increasing very quickly. 
(4)the property has been exposed to the market for more than two months.","Answer: 1 Explanation: Option (1) is correct because when real estate prices are increasing very quickly, they are reflecting the increasing market values of properties. The selling price would therefore likely be lower than the actual market value in a time of rapidly increasing real estate prices. Options (2) is incorrect because if a seller is not in a hurry to sell, he or she is likely to wait to obtain the highest possible price. Option (3) is incorrect because a buyer who is in a hurry to buy may pay a premium to acquire a property. Option (4) is incorrect because a property that has been exposed to the market for more than two months does not necessarily indicate that the sale price will be lower than the market value, as the market could fluctuate in many ways throughout the two months."
"Question 647: A local mortgage broker arranged a mortgage in the amount of $210,000. The borrower has agreed to pay a brokerage fee in the amount of $7,200 that is to be added to the loan amount, giving a face value of $217,200 for the loan.

(1)$74,600 
(2)$73,000

(4)Voltage is a measure of power or consumption.","Answer: 4 Explanation: Option (4) is correct because voltage is a measure of electrical potential, not power or consumption. Options (1), (2), and (3) are true statements."
"Question 652: The process used in underwriting income-producing properties is similar to that for residential borrower qualification except that in underwriting commercial properties: 
(1)a loan-to-value constraint is never used. 
(2)the income from the property is more important than the personal income of the borrower. 
(3)a loan-to-value constraint is never used. 
(4)a safety margin is not necessary.","Answer: 2 Explanation: Option (2) is correct because lenders are more interested in the income generated from the commercial property than the borrower’s personal income. Options (1), (3), and (4) are incorrect because they do not describe differences between underwriting income-producing properties and residential borrower qualification."
"Question 653: A board of variance is a board established to: 
(1)ensure that actions by municipalities are not at variance with the Local Government Act. 
(2)settle boundary line disputes between private parties. 
(3)ensure that actions by municipalities are not at variance with the Local Government Act. 
(4)permit a minor deviation from a zoning bylaw for an individual property owner.",Answer: 4 Explanation: Option (4) is correct because a board of variance must be established by every local government that has adopted a zoning bylaw to ensure that the bylaw does not cause undue hardship. A board of variance may grant minor variances from zoning bylaws where compliance would cause undue hardship provided that the variance would not conflict with the policies of the local government. Option (1) is incorrect because boards of variance do not enforce municipality compliance with the Local Government Act. Option (2) is incorrect because boards of variance do not settle boundary line disputes between private parties. Option (3) is incorrect because legal non-conforming uses may be permitted to exist for more than six months.
"Question 654: Which of the following is a liability on a financial statement? 
(1)Accumulated depreciation 
(2)Inventory 
(3)Accumulated depreciation 
(4)Accounts payable","Answer: 4 Explanation: Option (4) is correct because accounts payable is a liability, since it represents a debt owed. Option (1) is incorrect because accumulated depreciation will fall under the asset category of the balance sheet, and will take away from the value of the depreciable asset(s). Options (2) and (3) are incorrect because inventory and rent receivable are both current assets."
"Question 655: Jennie has rented her apartment on a month to month basis for two years without a rent increase. She receives a properly delivered rent increase notice on July 31 raising her rent from $750 per month to $1,075 per month, effective November 1. She feels this increase is excessive and discusses it with her landlord, but her landlord remains convinced that $1,075 is a fair market value rent, even though the applicable Consumer Price Index (CPI) is 3%. Which of the following statements is TRUE? 
(1)The notice of rent increase is invalid because it is less than six months before it becomes effective. 
(2)This rent increase cannot be valid or approved because it is greater than the CPI. 
(3)The notice of rent increase is invalid because it is less than six months before it becomes effective. 
(4)This rent increase will be valid only if approved for special circumstances as set out in the Residential Tenancy Regulations.","Answer: 4 Explanation: Option (4) is correct because the Residential Tenancy Regulation limits annual rent increases to an amount equal to the Consumer Price Index (CPI) for British Columbia (in this case, 3%). Since this rent increase exceeds this amount, it will only be valid if approved for special circumstances as set out in the Residential Tenancy Regulation. Option (1) is incorrect because written notice of a rent increase need only be given to a tenant at least three months before it becomes effective. Option (2) is incorrect because the landlord may apply for approval for this rent increase based on special circumstances. Option (3) is incorrect because a new landlord is not given the right to raise the rent above the set amount (the applicable CPI)."
"Question 656: Which of the following is a key determinant of the value of a property? 
(1)Vendor financing 
(2)Cash-equivalent price 
(3)Vendor financing 
(4)Rights of ownership","Answer: 4 Explanation: Option (4) is the correct answer because the legal rights of ownership and the physical property will determine the value of a property. The listing price, Option (3), may represent the value to owner, but does not determine the actual value that the property is worth in the market. Option (1) is incorrect because vendor financing may impact the value, but is not a key determinant of value. Option (2) is incorrect because cash-equivalent price represents the market value of a property only if non-market financing was involved in a sale/purchase."
"Question 657: Where a principal adopts a contract that their agent entered into without any authority: 
(1)the third party is not obligated to honour the contract if they do not wish to. 
(2)the principal can sue the agent for breach of warranty of authority. 
(3)the third party is not obligated to honour the contract if they do not wish to. 
(4)the agent becomes a party to that contract.","Answer: 3 Explanation: Option (3) is correct because a principal can retroactively ratify a contract which was entered into by his agent without the necessary authority. Ratification expresses the principal’s consent to be bound just as if the agent had been authorized to make the contract in the first place. Option (1) is incorrect because, if the principal ratifies the contract, the contract is valid and the third party is obligated to honour the contract. Option (2) is incorrect because a warranty of authority is an agent’s promise to third parties (not the principal) that his or her actions fall within the scope of authority given by the principal. Therefore, only third parties to whom the warranty of authority is made can sue the agent for breaching the warranty. Option (4) is incorrect because, where a principal adopts a contract which his agent entered into without any authority, the principal (not the agent) becomes a party to that contract."
"Question 658: Mr. and Mrs. Tom Jones and Ashraf Menzies have a signed contract of purchase and sale for a triplex owned by Alan Sinclair. Mr. and; Mrs. Jones have agreed to pay $100,000 each and Ashraf has agreed to pay the balance of $50,000. They would like their ownership registered as a joint tenancy. Which one of the following statements is TRUE? 
(1)Tom, Mrs. Jones, and Ashraf cannot register their ownership as a joint tenancy because they did not each contribute the same amount of cash. 
(2)If their interest is registered as a joint tenancy, Tom, Mrs. Jones, and Ashraf will each own an undivided interest in the triplex. 
(3)Tom, Mrs. Jones, and Ashraf cannot register their ownership as a joint tenancy because they did not each contribute the same amount of cash. 
(4)Tom, Mrs. Jones, and Ashraf cannot meet the four common law principles required to create a joint tenancy.","Answer: 2 Explanation: Option (2) is correct because, in a joint tenancy, co-owners are viewed as a single legal owner against everyone else; and therefore, each owns an undivided interest in the whole of the estate. Option (1) is incorrect because individuals can enter into a joint tenancy regardless of their respective financial contributions to the purchase of the property. Option (3) is incorrect because more than two individuals can enter into a single joint tenancy and because individuals do not have to be married to enter into a joint tenancy. Option (4) is incorrect because each of the following four common law “unities” can be satisfied: (1) all joint tenants must receive their interests at the same time; (2) all joint tenants must receive their interest from the same document; (3) all joint tenants must have the same interest in the land; and (4) all joint tenants must be entitled to possession of the whole estate."
"Question 659: A friend of yours is cleaning out her real estate office and is throwing away the hard copies of all her transaction-related documents. When you ask her why, she explains that she has electronic copies of all of these documents and that they are just taking up space. Which of the following statements regarding data backup and legal considerations should your friend be aware of? 
(1)Keeping only electronic copies of transaction-related documents is advisable and hard copies are not necessary in the real estate industry. 
(2)There is no need to keep hard copies because of the use of digital signatures. 
(3)Keeping only electronic copies of transaction-related documents is advisable and hard copies are not necessary in the real estate industry. 
(4)It is only necessary to retain hard copies of documents if they do not contain signatures or initials.","Answer: 3 Explanation: Option (3) is correct because any verification of dated communication helps to give credibility to a statement or allegation. However, verifying the authenticity of electronic documents and email communications is difficult. Further, electronic communication may not stand alone as evidence if there is a question as to the authenticity or origin of the communication. Therefore, keeping hard copies is extremely important from a legal perspective. Options (1), (2), and (4) are incorrect for the same reasons."
"Question 660: Which of the following correctly lists assets from most liquid to least liquid? 
(1)Accounts receivable, inventories, accounts payable, marketable securities 
(2)Marketable securities, accounts receivable, inventories, prepaid expenses 
(3)Accounts receivable, inventories, accounts payable, marketable securities 
(4)Building, cash, prepaid expenses, inventories","Answer: 2 Explanation: Option (2) is correct because marketable securities, accounts receivable, inventories, and prepaid expenses is the correct listing of assets from most to least liquid. Option (1) is incorrect because marketable securities are more liquid than accounts receivable, and accounts payable is not an asset. Option (3) is incorrect because marketable securities are more liquid than accounts receivable, and land is the least liquid asset listed. Option (4) is incorrect because inventory is generally more liquid than prepaid expenses, and the building is the least liquid asset listed."
"Question 661: Elly, a licensed real estate representative, entered into a written exclusive listing contract with Laura to list Laura’s house for sale for $300,800. Shortly after entering into this agreement, Elly’s licence expired. Unaware of the expiration of her licence, Elly proceeded to hold three open houses and several other showings of the house, eventually finding a buyer who offered $300,800 for the house. Laura accepted the offer, but when she learned about Elly’s licence expiry, she refused to pay any commission to Elly. Which of the following statements is TRUE? 
(1)A court will not award Elly any form of remuneration in this situation. 
(2)The Real Estate Services Act permits Elly to sue Laura for commission in this situation whether or not the listing contract specified the amount Elly was to receive. 
(3)A court will not award Elly any form of remuneration in this situation. 
(4)Based on the limited facts in this situation, the listing contract likely violates the statutory requirements of the Real Estate Services Act.","Answer: 1 Explanation: Option (1) is correct because section 4 of the Real Estate Services Act stipulates that if an agent is unlicensed at the time real estate services were provided, he or she cannot bring a court action to collect commission. Options (2) and (3) are incorrect for the same reason. Option (4) is incorrect because there is no indication, based on the facts presented in this situation, that the listing contract violates the statutory requirements of the Real Estate Services Act."
"Question 662: In which one of the following situations may the landlord choose to give the tenant one month’s notice of the end of the tenancy agreement? 
(1)Charles is renting a one-bedroom apartment in the West End of Vancouver on a month-to-month basis. He has been diligent in paying his rent on the due date each month but the landlord has recently discovered that Charles’ friend, Christine, has moved into the apartment with him. 
(2)Jordan’s warehouse is long overdue for a major renovation, which cannot be completed with the present tenant in occupation. Aladdin, the tenant, has four months left on his fixed term tenancy and does not wish to move. 
(3)Charles is renting a one-bedroom apartment in the West End of Vancouver on a month-to-month basis. He has been diligent in paying his rent on the due date each month but the landlord has recently discovered that Charles’ friend, Christine, has moved into the apartment with him. 
(4)MacGregor’s son is moving to Vancouver and wants to live in an apartment that MacGregor owns and has rented out to Mrs. Julian for the last 20 years.","Answer: 3 Explanation: Option (3) is correct because, under section 47(1)(a) of the Residential Tenancy Act, a landlord may give a tenant a notice of the end of a tenancy if the tenant does not pay the security deposit within 30 days of the date it is required to be paid under the agreement. Option (1) is incorrect because, as per section 47(1)(c) of the Residential Tenancy Act, a landlord may only give a tenant notice of the end of a tenancy for reasons relating to the number of occupants if there are an “unreasonable” number of occupants in the rental unit. Two occupants in a one-bedroom apartment would not be considered unreasonable, and therefore, a landlord could not end a tenancy for this reason. Option (2) is incorrect because Jordan cannot end the tenancy early in order to renovate the warehouse. Jordan must wait until the lease term expires. Option (4) is incorrect because MacGregor must give the tenant at least 2 months’ notice in order to end Mrs. Julian’s tenancy to allow his son to move into the apartment."
"Question 663: With respect to an insured mortgage loan, which of the following statements is FALSE? 
(1)In Canadian mortgage loan insurance, the lender pays the insurer a single premium, the cost of which is generally passed on to the borrower. 
(2)Borrowers can add the mortgage loan insurance premium to the mortgage amount. 
(3)In Canadian mortgage loan insurance, the lender pays the insurer a single premium, the cost of which is generally passed on to the borrower. 
(4)Federally regulated financial institutions require mortgage insurance in order to make loans with loan-to-value ratios higher than 80%.","Answer: 3 Explanation: Option (3) is correct (false) because there are several organizations that offer mortgage loan insurance such as CMHC, Genworth Financial Canada, and the Canada Guaranty Mortgage Insurance Company. Options (1), (2), and (4) are incorrect because they are true statements."
"Question 664: Ownership of land in British Columbia includes not only the surface of the land, but also: 
(1)the column of airspace above it insofar as the owner can see. 
(2)the gold and silver below the land to a depth of ten feet. 
(3)the column of airspace above it insofar as the owner can see. 
(4)petroleum down to the centre of the earth.","Answer: 3 Explanation: Option (1) is incorrect because landowners in British Columbia now own or have rights in the airspace above their property only to the extent that they can make effective use of it (not insofar as the owner can see). Option (2) is incorrect because the Government of British Columbia has reserved subsurface rights to gold and silver in favour of the Crown since the time when original Crown grants were made in the 19th century. Option (4) is incorrect because subsurface rights to petroleum have also been reserved in favour of the Crown since 1899; therefore, only landowners whose property was granted by the Crown prior to this date might have ownership of subsurface petroleum (depending on the terms of the original grant)."
"Question 665: A strata plan is: 
(1)filed in the Land Title Office and designates which parts of a strata projects are strata lots and which are common property. 
(2)used for both condominium and cooperative developments. 
(3)filed in the Land Title Office and designates which parts of a strata projects are strata lots and which are common property. 
(4)essentially a package of restrictive covenants.","Answer: 1 Explanation: Option (1) is correct because an owner developer must file a strata plan in order to create a strata development. The strata plan divides the entirely of the building between strata lots and common property. Option (2) is incorrect because cooperative developments are not strata developments, and therefore have no corresponding strata plans. Option (3) is incorrect because strata plans are required for all strata developments. Option (4) is incorrect because restrictive covenants impose restrictions on the use of one person’s land for the benefit of another piece of land. A strata plan does not impose restrictions on “burdened” land for the benefit of some other “benefitted” land. [NOTE: This question has been replaced.

"Question 666: The primary purpose of a credit analysis of a mortgagor is: 
(1)to ensure that the borrower has both the ability and the intention of complying with the mortgage agreement. 
(2)to determine if the borrower is worth suing if they default on the mortgage. 
(3)to ensure that the borrower has both the ability and the intention of complying with the mortgage agreement. 
(4)to appraise the value of the property given as security for the loan.","Answer: 1 Explanation: Option (1) is correct because a credit analysis evaluates an applicant’s ability to meet the terms of a mortgage and the amount of his or her available for future mortgage payments. Options (2), (3), and (4) are incorrect as they do not describe the primary purpose of a credit analysis of a mortgagor."
"Question 667: A licensee is required to provide the consumer with a Disclosure of Risks to Unrepresented Parties form if the licensee is providing trading services to the consumer as an unrepresented party in such a way that the licensee must provide a Disclosure of Representation in Trading Services form to that unrepresented party AND: 
(1)the unrepresented party is particularly vulnerable in the trade in real estate. 
(2)the licensee is also representing a client in the same trade in real estate. 
(3)the unrepresented party is particularly vulnerable in the trade in real estate. 
(4)the unrepresented party has never worked with a real estate licensee before.","Answer: 2 Explanation: Option (2) is correct because under section 55 of the Real Estate Services Rules, a licensee must provide a consumer with a Disclosure of Risks to Unrepresented Parties form when the licensee makes a disclosure under section 54 to an unrepresented party AND the licensee is also representing a client in the same trade in real estate. Options (1), (3), and (4) are incorrect because licensees are not required to make this disclosure to an unrepresented party if the licensee is not also representing a client in the same trade."
"Question 668: When a borrower is unable to make the mortgage payments (in part or full): 
(1)the lender will immediately use legal remedies to recover the outstanding amounts. 
(2)the borrower has the right to automatically adjust payment terms. 
(3)the lender will immediately use legal remedies to recover the outstanding amounts. 
(4)it may be due to loss of employment.","Answer: 4 Explanation: Option (4) is correct because a borrower may be unable to make the mortgage payments due to a number of reasons including loss of employment. Option (1) is incorrect because when this occurs, the lender can, but may choose not to, take immediate legal action against the borrower. Options (2) and (3) are incorrect because sometimes it is in the best interest of the lender to grant extra time for the borrower to repay the deficit, but the borrower cannot automatically adjust the payment terms."
"Question 669: The consumer price index is a good method to adjust sale prices to the level of values prevailing as of the date of appraisal: 
(1)where the comparable sales are deemed to be not recent. 
(2)where there are inadequate numbers of comparable sales within a particular neighbourhood. 
(3)where the comparable sales are deemed to be not recent. 
(4)under no circumstances.","Answer: 4 Explanation: Option (4) is correct because general price indices, such as the consumer price index or the shelter price index, are irrelevant to the appraisal of one particular property since changes in the value of consumer products are not necessarily the same as changes in the value of property. Therefore, Options (1), (2), and (3) are incorrect."
"Question 670: An appraiser is using the market approach for an appraisal of a single-family house. By proper adjustment, the appraiser can use sale prices of all the following properties for comparison purposes, EXCEPT: 
(1)houses in different neighbourhoods. 
(2)houses with different square footage. 
(3)houses in different neighbourhoods. 
(4)houses sold over six months ago.","Answer: 3 Explanation: Option (3) is correct because appraisers cannot use sale prices for houses recently sold between related parties for comparison purposes. Market value is determined by analyzing market transactions where the buyer and seller have no special relationship (i.e., the sale occurred at arm’s length) and the properties sold are similar (or comparable) to the subject property. Options (1), (2), and (4) are incorrect because with appropriate adjustment, the sale prices of all of these properties can be used for comparison purposes."
"Question 671: Wally Walters wants to determine the market value of his property. Unfortunately, he lives in a sparsely inhabited region where there are no similar properties that have recently sold. However, he does know that the replacement cost (new) of his 2,600 square foot house is $42.50 per square foot. The land value estimate using the comparative approach of appraisal is $41,500. Mr. Walters has not taken adequate care of his house and it has depreciated in value. There has been $16,300 of curable physical depreciation. In addition, the bathroom and kitchen fixtures are outdated; their replacement cost is $13,200. Based on the above information, what is the market value of Mr. Walters’ property? 
(1)$122,500 
(2)$81,000 
(3)$122,500 
(4)$135,700","Answer: 1 Explanation: Replacement cost of house: $42.50 × 2,600 = $110,500 Land: $41,500 Land + House = $152,000 minus depreciation ($16,300) = $135,700 minus bathroom kitchen fixtures ($13,200) = $122,500 The market value is $122,500."
"Question 672: You have a partially completed appraisal report that you need to fill in. The subject property has 5 bedrooms and an alarm system. The house next door is similar in all respects except for the number of bedrooms and alarm system. It recently sold for $445,500 and had a +$3,500 adjustment for bedrooms and a +$5,500 adjustment for an alarm system. If the market value of a bedroom is $3,500 and the market value of an alarm system is $5,500, it can be concluded that this comparable has: 
(1)4 bedrooms and no alarm system. 
(2)3 bedrooms and no alarm system. 
(3)4 bedrooms and no alarm system. 
(4)5 bedrooms and an alarm system.","Answer: 1 Explanation: Option (1) is correct because in relation to the subject property, this comparable has one less bedroom and no alarm system. Options (2), (3), and (4) are therefore incorrect."
"Question 673: Jonathan Wong has offered $231,000 for a house, providing he is able to obtain acceptable financing. The house lists for $242,000, but the lender has set the lending value at $238,000. The lender requires a loan-to-value ratio of 80% and a gross debt service ratio of 30%. Property taxes are $1,750 per year and Mr. Wong’s annual gross income is $65,000. If the interest rate is 6.5% per annum, compounded annually, the amortization period is 20 years, and payments are made monthly, what is the maximum amount this lender will advance, rounded to the nearest $100? 
(1)$201,300 
(2)$196,800 
(3)$201,300 
(4)$190,400","Answer: 4 Explanation: To solve this question, calculate the maximum amount of money that can be lent out given the two constraints: the loan-to-value amount and the gross debt service ratio amount. Calculate the loan amount for the loan-to-value constraint and then calculate the loan amount for the GDSR constraint. In order to determine the maximum amount that the lender will advance, choose the lesser of the two results. LTV = 80%"
"Question 674: Which of the following is NOT characteristic of a mortgage as an investment? 
(1)Smaller investors face a mortgage payment reinvestment problem. 
(2)Mortgages require a high initial outlay of capital. 
(3)Smaller investors face a mortgage payment reinvestment problem. 
(4)Mortgages are “unique”, which makes them difficult to trade.","Answer: 3 Explanation: Option (3) is false. Mortgages require a high degree of administrative work such as writing contracts, registering the mortgage charge, and subsequent administration of outstanding balance and refinancing. Options (1), (2), and (4) are incorrect because they are characteristics of a mortgage as an investment."
"Question 675: Cornelius gave a life tenancy to Ruel, which did not expressly state anything about Ruel’s liability for waste. Ruel will NOT be liable to the remainderman for: 
(1)permissive waste. 
(2)voluntary waste. 
(3)permissive waste. 
(4)equitable waste.","Answer: 1 Explanation: Option (1) is correct because, at common law, a life tenant is generally under no obligation to repair or compensate for waste that occurs as a result of allowing the property to deteriorate without any positive acts (permissive waste). Option (2) is incorrect because life tenants are liable to the remainderman for direct, positive acts that result in damage to the property beyond the use to which the life tenant is entitled (voluntary waste). Option (3) is incorrect because a life tenant is liable for direct, positive acts which improve rather than destroy the property (ameliorating waste) – but, usually no damages can be awarded, as the property has been improved. Option (4) is incorrect because a life tenant is liable for waste that he or she causes by flagrantly or maliciously damaging or destroying the property (equitable waste)."
"Question 676: Which of the following statements about depreciation expense is TRUE? 
(1)It is another name for capital cost allowance. 
(2)It is a deductible expense in computing income for purposes of income taxation. 
(3)It is another name for capital cost allowance. 
(4)It is the method used to allocate the cost of an asset over time.","Answer: 4 Explanation: Option (4) is correct because depreciation expense is used to allocate the cost of a depreciable asset over the course of its life. Option (1) is incorrect because depreciation expense is an accounting framework, whereas capital cost allowance is a taxation framework. Option (2) is incorrect because depreciation expense cannot be deducted from taxable income, whereas capital cost allowance can be. Option (3) is incorrect because land is not a depreciable asset."
"Question 677: The owner of an interest in real property that is located in British Columbia always has: 
(1)a fee simple interest. 
(2)the right to use their property in any way they choose. 
(3)a fee simple interest. 
(4)common law rights as modified by legislation.","Answer: 4 Explanation: Option (4) is correct because real property ownership in British Columbia is based on English common law property rights as modified by legislation such as the Property Law Act and the Land Title Act. Option (1) is incorrect because an owner of an interest in real property in British Columbia may have a number of interests that fall short of a fee simple interest (e.g., life estate, estate pur autre vie, leasehold, etc.). Option (2) is incorrect because the extent of the usage rights enjoyed by an owner of an interest in real property depends heavily upon the type of interest that the owner holds. Additionally, even an owner of real property in fee simple must still abide by various common law restrictions as well as legislative restrictions (e.g., municipalities have the power to regulate subdivision). Option (3) is incorrect because an owner of an interest in real property in British Columbia can have an interest less than a 99-year lease from the Crown (e.g., a lease for a term of less than 99 years)."

"Question 680: In which of the following situations will the agency authority continue to exist? 
(1)Lorne lists his house for sale with Steve. The house burns down. 
(2)Lorne enters into an exclusive listing agreement with his agent Mark. Lorne then sells the property himself without Mark’s assistance. 
(3)Lorne lists his house for sale with Steve. The house burns down. 
(4)None of the above.","Answer: 4 Explanation: Option (4) is correct because each of the scenarios laid out in Options (1), (2), and (3) would terminate the agency authority. Option (1) is incorrect because the doctrine of frustration appears to apply to the agency relationship, meaning that if a house listed for sale burns down, the agency would probably be terminated. Option (2) is incorrect because, the moment the principal sells his or her property, he or she terminates the authority of all listing brokers, no matter what kind of listing agreement they have. The principal may, however, still be liable to pay commission. Option (3) is incorrect because either party to an agency agreement can terminate the authority (orally or by conduct) at will."
"Question 681: Blackacre, a revenue producing property, has been sold. The date of adjustment will be January 31, 2011, exactly 18 months after the contract of purchase and sale was signed and a deposit of $3,500 was paid directly to the seller. If interest on this deposit accrues for the benefit of the buyer, 6% per annum, compounded annually, what will be the amount shown on the seller’s statement of adjustment?

Since the buyer paid the deposit to the seller directly, it reduces the amount of cash that the seller will receive on closing. Therefore, the $3,819.68 will appear as a debit on the seller’s statement of adjustments."
"Question 682: Which of the following statements is TRUE with respect to listing contracts? 
(1)While a listing contract is a contract between the brokerage and the seller, the buyer is bound to some of the terms contained in the contract. 
(2)It is not necessary that an exclusive listing contain a specified duration or commencement date. 
(3)While a listing contract is a contract between the brokerage and the seller, the buyer is bound to some of the terms contained in the contract.

Option (1) is incorrect because the buyer is not privy to the listing contract, meaning that the buyer owes no rights and has no obligations under the listing contract. Option (2) is incorrect because Clause 1A of the standard form listing agreement created by the British Columbia Real Estate Association requires an “Effective Date” and an “Expiry Date”. Option (3) is incorrect because an open listing provides less protection for the agent than an exclusive listing. This is because, as opposed to an exclusive listing, an open listing does not prevent the seller from employing a number of other brokerages to represent the seller. Commission is only paid to the brokerage who is the effective cause of the eventual sale."
"Question 683: Which of the following will NOT result in the release or expiry of an offer? 
(1)The illiteracy of the offeree 
(2)The expiry of a specified time limit in the offer prior to acceptance 
(3)The illiteracy of the offeree 
(4)Revocation of the offer, communicated to the offeree by the offeror","Answer: 1 Explanation: Option (1) is correct because the general rule is that an illiterate person is bound by a contract that he or she has agreed to, unless he or she did not know the general nature of the contract. Therefore, the illiteracy of the offeree, alone, is insufficient to release an offer. Option (2) is incorrect because an offer expires if it is not accepted within the time limit specified in the offer. Option (3) is incorrect because a counter-offer constitutes a rejection of the original offer. Option (4) is incorrect because the offeror can revoke an offer at any time provided that the offeror communicates the revocation to the offeree prior to acceptance."
"Question 684: Which of the following options is an advantage of using a central, gas-fired, forced hot water heating system? 
(1)Its air filtration capabilities 
(2)The production of a steady, consistent heat 
(3)Its air filtration capabilities 
(4)Heat transmission is completely by radiation","Answer: 2 Explanation: Option (2) is correct because a central gas fired, forced hot water heating system produces steady and consistent heat. Option (1) is incorrect as this type of heating system does not provide air circulation or filtration. Option (3) is incorrect as this type of heating system must be kept circulating in cold weather otherwise water will freeze and the piping will crack. Option (4) is false because this type of heating system transmits heat through convection and radiation."
"Question 685: Which of the following could be called “legislation”? 
(1)The Land Title Act 
(2)The Principle of Specific Performance 
(3)The Land Title Act 
(4)All of the above","Answer: 1 Explanation: Option (1) is correct because the Land Title Act is a body of law written and passed by the provincial government of British Columbia. Option (2) is incorrect because specific performance is a remedy that was developed by the courts of equity, not enacted via government statute. Option (3) is incorrect because the equity of redemption is a doctrine that was developed by the courts of equity, not enacted via government statue. Option (4) is incorrect because Options (2) and (3) are incorrect."
"Question 686: Which one of the following is NOT a mortgagor covenant? 
(1)Pay all taxes on the land and on the improvements 
(2)Keep the premises in a reasonable state of repair 
(3)Pay all taxes on the land and on the improvements 
(4)Pay the debt and accrued interest according to the agreed upon schedule","Answer: 3 Explanation: Option (3) is correct because there is a fundamental principle of mortgage law which prohibits “clogging” on “the equity of redemption”. This principle states that the borrower (or the mortgagor) cannot be prevented by the terms of the mortgage from eventually redeeming his or her property free from the conditions contained in the mortgage upon repayment of the loan. An option to purchase a mortgaged property given by the borrower to the lender at the time the mortgage is negotiated, if exercised, would prevent the mortgagor from redeeming his or her property upon repayment, and is therefore void. Option (1) is incorrect because, in mortgage agreements, mortgagors generally covenant to pay all taxes on land and the improvements. Option (2) is incorrect because it is common for a mortgagor to covenant to keep the land and buildings thereof in “good condition and repair”, thereby protecting the value of the security (the property). Option (4) is incorrect because the repayment clause of a mortgage agreement will set out the borrower’s promise to pay the debt and accrued interest according to the schedule agreed upon."
"Question 687: Which one of the following statements is TRUE? 
(1)Given that the net operating income remains constant, the market value of a property rises as the required yield rises. 
(2)The market value of an income-producing property is best determined by averaging the sale prices of any three other income-producing properties that have recently sold. 
(3)Given that the net operating income remains constant, the market value of a property rises as the required yield rises. 
(4)The capitalization rate applied to the net operating income of an investment property is related to the yield on comparable investment properties.","Answer: 4 Explanation: Option (4) is correct because it is true. Option (1) is incorrect because given that the net operating income remains constant, the market value of the property will decline as the required yield rises. Option (2) is incorrect because the market value of an income-producing property is best determined by the yields that prospective purchasers reasonably expect to earn. Option (3) is incorrect because net operating income and gross realized income (also known as “gross realized revenue” or “gross effective income”) are different; net operating income is derived by subtracting operating expenses from gross realized income."
"Question 688: Robert asks Whitney to act as his agent at the auction of the effects of a deceased rock star. Robert was an enthusiastic fan of the deceased and tells Whitney that no matter what, he must become the owner of the deceased’s vintage Rolls Royce, which is painted in a most attractive paisley motif. Whitney is also told that under no circumstances is she to come away from the auction without buying this automobile for Robert. At the auction, the rock star’s paisley Rolls Royce is offered with a second pin-striped version of the vehicle. The two vehicles are offered as a package and accordingly, Whitney as the successful bidder purchases both vehicles for Robert. If asked to discuss Whitney’s scope of authority, you would correctly answer that during the course of the fact pattern, Whitney was provided with: 
(1)express authority. 
(2)implied authority. 
(3)express authority. 
(4)neither express nor implied authority.",Answer: 3 Explanation: Option (3) is correct because Robert expressly granted Whitney the authority to purchase the deceased’s “paisley motif” Rolls Royce by instructing Whitney not to come away from the auction without buying the automobile under any circumstances. These instructions also granted Whitney the implied authority to purchase the second “pin-striped” automobile since purchasing the second automobile was necessary in order to carry out the express instructions (to purchase the “paisley motif” automobile). Option (4) is incorrect for this reason. Options (1) and (2) are incorrect because they do not describe the full scope of Whitney’s authority.
"Question 689: Which of the following correctly outlines the objective/task method of creating a promotional budget? 
(1)Define the competition, outline competitors’ expenditures, and set tasks to maintain competitive-parity with competitors 
(2)Conduct tasks in order to reach a sales objective that is specific, realistic, measurable, and within a predetermined timeline 
(3)Define the competition, outline competitors’ expenditures, and set tasks to maintain competitive-parity with competitors 
(4)Define the advertising objective as “SMART”, outline the necessary tasks, and estimate the costs of performing the tasks","Answer: 4 Explanation: Option (4) is correct because the “objective/task” method of creating a promotional budget requires that the licensee first determine the objectives of the advertisement, and then determine the desired tasks and activities necessary to reach the objective. This involves defining a “SMART” marketing objective, outlining the tasks required to attain the objective, and estimating the cost of performing these tasks. Option (1) is incorrect because this approach describes the “follow-the-competition” method. Option (2) is incorrect because this approach describes the “SMART” criteria for developing effective business and marketing goals. Option (3) is incorrect because it fails to discuss the step of defining a “SMART” marketing objective."

(1)A site that allows the user to create written documents in MLS® format 
(2)A site that is used to register domain names for real estate offices 
(3)A site that allows the user to create written documents in MLS® format 
(4)A site that pulls together information on real estate related topics with a focus on real estate listings","Answer: 4 Explanation: Option (4) is correct because the MLS® serves many functions, including computing listing searches, producing automated hot sheets, and generating Comparative Market Analysis (CMA) presentations and other client prospecting tools. Options (1), (2), and (3) are incorrect because none of these statements correctly describes a primary function of the MLS®."

(1)less than the effective annual rate for 7.2% per annum, compounded quarterly. 
(2)greater than the effective annual rate for 8.5% per annum, compounded annually.

"Question 694: The interest that is acquired by a buyer of a strata lot is: 
(1)a share in the strata corporation in proportion to the unit entitlement. 
(2)a joint tenancy with all of the other strata lot owners. 
(3)a share in the strata corporation in proportion to the unit entitlement. 
(4)a fee simple interest in the strata lot and a fee simple interest, as a tenant in common, with respect to the common property.","Answer: 4 Explanation: Option (4) is correct because it correctly describes the interest which is acquired by a buyer of strata lot. Option (1) is incorrect because it describes what is acquired by a buyer of a unit in a cooperative, not a strata lot. Option (2) is incorrect because a buyer of a strata lot does not acquire their interest as a joint tenant with all of the other strata lot owners. If this was the case, then each owner within a given strata would share an undivided interest in the entire property (including each other’s units). Option (3) is incorrect because if the common property was shared via a joint tenancy agreement, then each owner would share a single undivided interest, and ownership could not be allocated in proportion to the unit entitlement."

"Question 698: Which of the following is NOT a private lender? 
(1)Mortgage corporations 
(2)Vendors who carry a part of the purchase price by granting a mortgage loan on a property 
(3)Mortgage corporations 
(4)Credit unions","Answer: 4 Explanation: Option (4) is correct because credit unions are considered to be institutional lenders that finance their investment by accepting deposits from their members. Private lenders are different from institutional lenders because private lenders typically do not fund their investment by receiving deposits from individuals. Options (1), (2), and (3) are incorrect because they are all examples of private lenders."
"Question 699: Where no time period is stipulated in an offer, the offer: 
(1)will lapse in 24 hours’ time. 
(2)will lapse after a reasonable time. 
(3)will lapse in 24 hours’ time. 
(4)will not lapse but rather, it must be revoked by the offeror.","Answer: 2 Explanation: Option (2) is correct because, where no time limit is specified, an offer will lapse after a reasonable time has passed. Courts will determine what constitutes a “reasonable” time for acceptance based on the nature of the offer or the nature of what is being sold. Options (1) and (3) are incorrect because there is no set expiration time for offers where no time period is stipulated. Option (4) is incorrect because offers can expire without being revoked by the offeror."

(2)A citizen of the United Kingdom who purchased land in Vancouver while staying in Canada on a working holiday visa. She received status as a permanent resident of Canada six months after purchasing the home. 
(3)An American citizen who is living in Seattle and has purchased the land as an investment property. 
(4)A Canadian citizen who holds title on the property for a friend who is a Japanese citizen and is looking to move to Canada after finishing a three year work contract in Tokyo.","Answer: 2 Explanation: Option (2) is correct because an individual who purchases property, pays the Foreign Buyers’ Tax, and within a year becomes a permanent resident or citizen of Canada, is eligible to claim back the Foreign Buyers’ Tax that he or she paid. Option (1) is incorrect because the tax applies to foreign nationals who are not Canadian citizens or permanent residents of Canada. Option (3) is incorrect because the foreign buyer’s tax applies to foreign corporations. Although the company was incorporated in Canada, it is controlled by a foreign corporation, are therefore would be considered a foreign corporation for the purpose of the tax. Option (4) is incorrect because a Canadian citizen who holds title for a foreign national is considered to be a taxable trustee, and is therefore subject to the tax."

(2)Where an item is affixed slightly to the premises it will be considered, based on the first impression, to be a fixture. 
(3)Where an item has been affixed for the enhancement of the use of the premises, that is evidence the item is a chattel. 
(4)The test for fixtures and chattels examines the degree of affixation of an item and the purpose of affixation of the item.","Answer: 1 Explanation: Option (1) is correct because the “better use” test states that the affixation of an object for the purpose of improving the property will be taken as evidence that the object is a fixture, not a chattel (La Salle Recreations Ltd. v. Canadian Camdex Investments Ltd.). Option (2) is incorrect because part two of the test articulated in Stack v. T. Eaton Co. states that articles affixed to the land even slightly are presumed to be part of the land, unless the circumstances show that they were intended to remain as chattels. Option (3) is incorrect because the courts have developed the Stack v. Eaton test, a two part test for determining whether an item is a fixture or a chattel. Option (4) is incorrect because the Stack v. Eaton test examines both the degree of affixation and the purpose of affixation as factors which may overturn the presumption that articles affixed to the land are fixtures."

"Question 705: In which one of the following mortgage repayment schemes do the monthly mortgage payments increase on a regular basis? 
(1)Reverse annuity mortgage 
(2)Graduated payment mortgage 
(3)Reverse annuity mortgage 
(4)Interest accruing mortgage","Answer: 2 Explanation: Option (2) is correct because a graduated payment mortgage has payments that increase on a regular basis over a specified term. Option (1) is incorrect because in a reverse annuity mortgage, there is no repayment until the end of the loan term or the death of the borrower; instead, over the term of the mortgage, the lender advances funds to the borrower. Option (3) is incorrect because in a straight line principal reduction mortgage, the same amount of principal is always paid and the corresponding interest is based on the outstanding balance; therefore, the monthly mortgage payments decrease. Option (4) is incorrect because in an interest accruing mortgage, no payments of interest or principal are made during the life of the loan."
"Question 706: Which of the following statements about federal legislation governing mortgage interest rates is TRUE? 
(1)The Interest Act requires that the rate of interest chargeable under a mortgage be “reasonable”, in the prevailing market for funds. 
(2)The Criminal Code defines a criminal rate of interest as an effective annual rate in excess of 50%. 
(3)The Interest Act requires that the rate of interest chargeable under a mortgage be “reasonable”, in the prevailing market for funds. 
(4)The Interest Act provides that if a mortgage agreement does not specify the rate of interest chargeable, the rate allowed by law is 5%.","Answer: 4 Explanation: Option (4) is correct because section 3 of the Interest Act states that if a document requires interest to be paid but the rate is not set out then the rate allowed by law is 5% per annum. Option (1) is incorrect because the Interest Act does not require that the rate of interest chargeable under a mortgage be “reasonable”, in the prevailing market for funds. The Interest Act imposes no general cap on mortgage interest rates and states that, except as otherwise provided for by an Act of Parliament, any person may charge “any rate of interest…that is agreed on”. Option (2) is incorrect because the Criminal Code defines a criminal rate of interest as an effective annual rate of over 60%, not 50%. Option (3) is incorrect because section 10 of the Interest Act does not impose a requirement that the mortgage not be for a business purpose in order for an individual to qualify for the right to prepay his or her mortgage. Section 10 applies where: (a) the borrower is an individual; and (b) the mortgage provides that it is not payable for more than five years from the date of the mortgage."

"Question 708: In order for a licensee to be liable for damages caused by a negligent misstatement, certain facts must be proved. Which of the following does NOT need to be proved? 
(1)That the licensee making the statement did so in the course of business. 
(2)That the licensee making the statement had a contractual relationship with the person to whom they gave the advice. 
(3)That the licensee making the statement did so in the course of business. 
(4)That the licensee making the statement knows, or should have known, that the advice was relied upon.","Answer: 2 Explanation: Option (2) is correct because a licensee may be held liable for damages caused by a negligent misstatement made to a person with whom they do not have a contractual relationship. For example, a licensee acting for a seller could be held liable for negligent misrepresentation for a statement made to a buyer despite having no contractual relationship with the buyer. Options (1) and (4) are incorrect because the special relationship giving rise to a duty to take care (not to make negligent misstatements) will be created where a skilled person, such as a real estate licensee, gives advice in the course of his or her business to a person who is reasonable going to rely on that advice. Option (3) is incorrect because a skilled person, such as a real estate licensee, can avoid liability for negligent misstatements by giving their advice or opinion with a clear qualification that he or she accepts no responsibility for the accuracy or reliability of the advice."
"Question 709: In order to facilitate the exchange of possible resources in a negotiation, it is important: 
(1)to make repeated concessions in order to get the other negotiator to follow. 
(2)to deliberate issue by issue. 
(3)to make repeated concessions in order to get the other negotiator to follow. 
(4)not to disclose your true interests to the other side.","Answer: 3 Explanation: Option (3) is correct because the mutual exchange of concessions is crucial to effective negotiations. If you enter negotiations unprepared to make concessions it is unlikely that the other party will be willing to do so. Option (1) is incorrect because it is important that concessions occur in a relatively reciprocal fashion. If one party makes repeated concessions without expecting the other party to follow with similar behaviour, this encourages the latter party to hold tight and not participate in the exchange of resources. Option (2) is incorrect because considerable research demonstrates that more optimal solutions are reached when parties do not go issue by issue, and instead package and trade multiple issues simultaneously. Option (4) is incorrect because disclosing your underlying interests will often result in more effective negotiations. If you share your true interests, the other party will often reciprocate. This allows both parties to identify the true needs and desires of each other and then to find creative solutions that will satisfy those needs and desires."
"Question 710: RE/LAX Realty Inc. has ended the current year with a net income of $234,000. During the year, RE/LAX issued $14,000 in dividends, incurred $112,000 of operating expenses, and paid $15,000 in taxes. Which of the following MOST likely occurred on RE/LAX’s balance sheet? 
(1)Owners’ equity increased by $234,000. 
(2)Revenue decreased by $14,000. 
(3)Owners’ equity increased by $234,000. 
(4)Retained earnings increased by $220,000.","Answer: 4 Explanation: Option (4) is correct because changes to retained earnings are calculated by taking the amount of net income less any dividends paid to shareholders. RE/LAX earned a net income of $234,000 and paid $14,000 in dividends; therefore, the retained earnings account on their balance sheet should increase by $220,000. Option (1) is therefore incorrect. Options (2) and (3) are also incorrect because net income and revenue comes from the income statement rather than the balance sheet."
"Question 711: Johnny Collins is trying to design his new home to be as energy efficient in heating as possible in a cold climate with harsh winters. On which side of the house should he place the largest windows? 
(1)North 
(2)South 
(3)North 
(4)West","Answer: 2 Explanation: Option (2) is correct because south facing windows are the most energy efficient in heating. Options (1), (3), and (4) are therefore incorrect."
"Question 712: In terms of appraisal, “recent” means: 
(1)up to three months ago. 
(2)that time period during which demand and supply conditions have remained relatively stable. 
(3)up to three months ago. 
(4)the time period that has expired since a number of properties similar to the subject property were listed for sale.","Answer: 2 Explanation: Option (2) is correct because in terms of appraisal, “recent” refers to the time period for which supply and demand conditions have not changed or have remained relatively stable. Options (1), (3), and (4) are therefore incorrect."
"Question 713: Which of the following options BEST describes a caveat? 
(1)A warning issued by the Prosecutor’s Office 
(2)Formal notice that a court action has been commenced 
(3)A warning issued by the Prosecutor’s Office 
(4)A notice placed on the certificate of title at the request of a person who claims an interest in the land","Answer: 4 Explanation: Option (4) is correct because a caveat is a note placed on a certificate of title by a person claiming an interest in land that temporarily prevents all dealings (e.g., transfers, mortgages, etc.) with the land inconsistent with the estate or interest claimed by the caveator. Option (1) is incorrect because caveats are not issued by the Prosecutor’s Office. Option (2) is incorrect because a caveat is a temporary “freezing” measure. If a party commences a court action concerning the property, then a certificate of pending litigation can be registered against the property to provide formal notice of that court action. Option (3) is incorrect because builder’s liens are registered as charges on title, not as caveats."
"Question 714: Which one of the following is TRUE with respect to the estimate of vacancy rates in the appraisal of income-producing properties? 
(1)Vacancy rates are expressed as a percentage of net operating income. 
(2)Vacancy rates are considered an operating expense. 
(3)Vacancy rates are expressed as a percentage of net operating income. 
(4)Vacancy rates are needed because the 100% occupancy assumption of gross potential revenue is unrealistic for most properties.","Answer: 4 Explanation: Option (4) is correct because it is unlikely that 100% occupancy will be reached in most properties. Option (1) is incorrect because vacancy rates are expressed as a percentage of gross potential revenue. Option (2) is incorrect because vacancy rates are not considered an operating expense; they are an allowance for reductions in gross potential revenue attributable to vacancies, tenant turnover, and nonpayment of rent or other income. Option (3) is incorrect because vacancy allowance is determined by the long-term vacancy rates in the area; therefore, it does not matter if the subject property has never had any vacancies before."
"Question 715: Yuppie is the sole proprietor of The Mountain Bike Emporium. On her balance sheet as at December 31, 20XX, total assets were $185,900. If the only liabilities were accounts payable of $2,900 and long-term debt of $89,450, what is the amount of Owner’s Equity: Ms. Yuppie, Capital account? 
(1)$93,550 
(2)$92,350 
(3)$93,550 
(4)$175,200","Answer: 1 Explanation: Option (1) is correct because since total assets = total liabilities on a balance sheet, if the total assets for The Mountain Bike Emporium = $185,900 and the only liabilities were accounts payable of $2,900 and long-term debt of $89,450, the amount of owner’s equity = $93,550 ($185,900 – $2,900 – $89,450). Options (2), (3), and (4) are therefore incorrect."
"Question 716: Which of the following statements regarding generally accepted accounting principles is FALSE? 
(1)Revenues are recognized at the time they are earned. 
(2)Fiscal year ends cannot be changed at will. 
(3)Revenues are recognized at the time they are earned. 
(4)Expenses are recognized at the time they are incurred.","Answer: 3 Explanation: Option (3) is correct because according to the cost principle, an asset must be recorded for the amount that was paid for it. Options (1), (2), and (4) are incorrect because they are true statements."
"Question 717: Joe, a store keeper, asked Harry, a courier, to deliver some groceries for him, which Harry did. What is the result? 
(1)Joe does not have to pay Harry anything because Harry’s actions are past consideration. 
(2)Harry could bring an action under the Real Estate Services Act to force Joe to pay for the services. 
(3)Joe does not have to pay Harry anything because Harry’s actions are past consideration. 
(4)Harry could bring an action under section 54 of the Law and Equity Act to force Joe to pay for the services.","Answer: 3 Explanation: Option (3) is correct because quantum meruit is the doctrine that no one who benefits by the labour and material of another should be unjustly enriched thereby. In the circumstances of this question, the law will invoke quantum meruit to imply a promise (given by Joe to Harry) to pay a reasonable about for the delivery of the groceries, even though a specific contract price was not agreed to. Option (1) is incorrect for the same reason. Option (2) is incorrect because the delivery of groceries does not fall within the scope of the Real Estate Services Act. Option (4) is incorrect because section 54 if the Law and Equity Act deals with waiver of conditions precedent, not payment for services."
"Question 718: Which of the following scenarios is LEAST likely to offend section 52 or section 74.01 of the Competition Act (i.e., the criminal and civil offences of misleading advertising)? 
(1)A licensee knowingly misrepresents a strata unit as having two bedrooms, but it only has one bedroom. 
(2)A licensee advertised a house as having a recently renovated kitchen, which was false. The licensee did not know the statement was false, and did not investigate the matter. 
(3)A licensee knowingly misrepresents a strata unit as having two bedrooms, but it only has one bedroom. 
(4)A licensee advertises a Yaletown condo as 1,000 square feet. The condo is only 998 square feet.","Answer: 4 Explanation: Option (4) is correct because, in order to offend section 52 and section 74.01 of the Competition Act, a representation must be “false or misleading in a material respect”. Despite being strictly false, understating the square footage of a condo by merely 2 square feet would likely be insufficient to constitute a material misrepresentation. Option (1) is incorrect because misrepresenting a strata unit as having two bedrooms when it only has one would be considered false and misleading in a material respect. Option (2) is incorrect because section 52 prohibits reckless misrepresentations, and falsely advertising a house as having a recently renovated kitchen without first investigating the matter would be considered reckless. This false advertisement would also offend section 74.01, since section 74.01 imposes no requirement that the deceptive practices were made knowingly or recklessly. Option (3) is incorrect because advertising homes starting at $700,000 when the lowest priced home is, in fact, priced $300,000 higher, would be considered false and misleading in a material respect."
"Question 719: A visitor enters an apartment building to visit a tenant. As he enters the lobby, the skylight above collapses, injuring the visitor. If the visitor decides to sue the owner and/or building manager, what cause of action will the visitor likely use? 
(1)Negligent misrepresentation 
(2)Occupier’s liability 
(3)Negligent misrepresentation 
(4)Nuisance","Answer: 2 Explanation: Option (2) is correct because the Occupiers Liability Act imposes a duty on occupiers of premises (in this case, the owner and/or building manager) to take such care as in all the circumstances is reasonable to see that persons coming onto the property (in this case, the visitor) will be reasonably safe. In this scenario, the visitor can argue that this duty was not met because the skylight collapsed, inuring him. Option (1) is incorrect because, based on the facts provided, no untrue statement was made by the owner or the building manager to the visitor. Option (3) is incorrect because, on these facts, there is nothing that establishes a fiduciary duty owed by the owner or the building manager to the visitor (a fiduciary duty is a special type of duty imposed only in select situations). Option (4) is incorrect because the collapse of the skylight did not interfere with the visitor’s use and enjoyment of the visitor’s own property."
"Question 720: Assume that a seller instructs his real estate licensee to make certain oral representations regarding a property that both the seller and the licensee know to be false. If the purchaser later sues the seller and the licensee on the basis of this misrepresentation, then: 
(1)the seller will be liable to the buyer because he explicitly authorized the tort. 
(2)the licensee can escape personal liability by arguing that he was authorized to commit the tort. 
(3)the seller will be liable to the buyer because he explicitly authorized the tort. 
(4)the buyer’s only remedy will be a court order against the seller for damages.","Answer: 1 Explanation: Option (1) is correct because the seller will be liable because he, as the principal: (a) is responsible for the acts of his agent and (b) expressly authorized the tort. Option (2) is incorrect because an agent can never escape liability for torts committed by the agent on the basis that the agent was authorized by the principal to commit them. Option (3) is incorrect because the inclusion of this clause in the contract of purchase and sale gives the vendor protection against innocent misrepresentations; however, it will not protect the vendor in the case of fraudulent misrepresentation. Option (4) is incorrect because, as previously mentioned, the buyer can also bring an action for damages against the licensee. The buyer can also sue for rescission of the contract."
"Question 721: Which of the following statements concerning a corporation’s capacity to contract is TRUE? 
(1)Under the Business Corporations Act, a contract entered into by a company before that company exists CANNOT be ratified after the company is formed. 
(2)There can never be a limitation on the legal capacity of a corporation to enter a contract because a corporation can contract just as an individual person can. 
(3)Under the Business Corporations Act, a contract entered into by a company before that company exists CANNOT be ratified after the company is formed. 
(4)None of the above","Answer: 3 Explanation: Option (3) is correct because all companies must have an official records office. At that office, any person can look over the incorporation documents of the company. Option (1) is incorrect because the common law has been altered by statute to make it possible for companies incorporated under the Business Corporations Act to ratify a pre-incorporation contract by act or conduct. Option (2) is incorrect because different ratification rules apply to companies operating in British Columbia that are incorporated under federal or another province’s legislation. These rules may, therefore, restrict the legal capacity of a corporation to enter a contract."
"Question 722: What is the purpose of restating many of the common law fiduciary duties owed by a licensee to a client in the Real Estate Services Rules? 
(1)In the case of a breach of fiduciary duty, the client will be able to receive twice the amount of damages. 
(2)It allows a client to also bring action against the licensee for a breach of the Rules. 
(3)In the case of a breach of fiduciary duty, the client will be able to receive twice the amount of damages. 
(4)It tends to be easier to prove a violation of the Rules, allowing judges to rule in favour of the client more often with the Rules than with the common law fiduciary duties.","Answer: 3 Explanation: Option (3) is correct because the Real Estate Services Rules (the “Rules”) restate these duties so that the British Columbia Financial Services Authority can initiate disciplinary proceedings against the licensee independently of any common law action that a client may bring against the licensee. Option (1) is incorrect because the client will not be able to receive additional damages under the Rules. Option (2) is incorrect because a client can only bring action against a licensee for breaching his or her common law duties, not for a breach of the Rules. Option (4) is incorrect because when the Rules simply restate a common law fiduciary duty, it will not be easier (or more difficult) to prove a breach of either."
"Question 723: A mortgage broker will advance $97,000 to a borrower who has agreed to pay a brokerage fee of $2,200. As a consequence, the face value of the loan will be $99,200. The loan will be amortized over 25 years with monthly payments at j2 = 6%. Calculate the monthly payment required to amortize the loan. 
(1)$620.62

"Question 724: Akiko Yamada vacated the property she had just sold, taking all her household furniture. Assuming she has taken each of the following items, which item(s) must Akiko replace? (Assume that none of the following items have been dealt with specifically in the contract of purchase and sale.) 
(1)A small Persian throw rug from the front hall, which had been chosen especially to complement the colours in the marble on the floor 
(2)An antique, stained glass window, which was hung on two large hooks in front of the living room window 
(3)A small Persian throw rug from the front hall, which had been chosen especially to complement the colours in the marble on the floor 
(4)Akiko must replace all of the above three items.","Answer: 3 Explanation: Option (3) is correct because the wall-to-wall carpeting that Akiko removed is most likely a fixture, and therefore was included in the purchase price (i.e., should have remained with the property when it was sold). Per Stack v. T. Eaton Co., articles affixed to the land even slightly – as the wall-to-wall carpeting is – are presumed to be part of the land. The purpose of affixing the carpeting was most likely to improve the den; therefore, the presumption that the carpeting is a fixture is unlikely to be overturned. Option (1) is incorrect because a throw rug is not attached to the land (except by its own weight), and therefore is presumed to be a chattel. Unless stipulated in the contract of purchase and sale, chattels are excluded from the purchase price of real property. Option (2) is incorrect because the stained glass window is most likely a chattel. The stained glass window, being attached (via hooks), will initially be presumed a fixture (per Stack v. T. Eaton Co.). However, this presumption is easily overturned. The window is affixed only slightly, being hung on two hooks, and therefore is quite easily removed. Additionally, since the antique window is merely hung in front of the living room window, it serves no apparent structural function. Therefore, the purpose of affixing the stained glass window is most likely to better enjoy the window as a decorative piece (similar to a painting), rather than to improve the land."
"Question 725: An acquaintance of yours has approached you and wants to know why the bank that may finance his purchase of a house requires an appraisal. He claims that since an appraisal is not required for an investment in stocks, an appraisal should not be required for an investment in real property. Which of the following statements provides the BEST reasoning for your support of the bank’s requirement? 
(1)The high turnover of real estate relative to stocks means that only an expert can keep up with changing values. 
(2)The local nature of the real estate market implies that the flow of information will be unlimited and easy to assemble. 
(3)The high turnover of real estate relative to stocks means that only an expert can keep up with changing values. 
(4)Real estate purchase decisions are generally less significant than decisions regarding an individual share purchase.","Answer: 3 Explanation: Option (3) is the correct answer. Appraisals are required to determine the value of real property because it is difficult to find properties that are very much alike. Unlike real property, other financial assets such as stocks are more homogenous and will have an explicitly determined price. Options (1), (2), and (4) are incorrect."
"Question 726: Which of the following is the MOST common type of construction today for high-rise apartment buildings? 
(1)Wood stud frame 
(2)Steel studs and concrete topping 
(3)Wood stud frame 
(4)Masonry walls and wood floors","Answer: 3 Explanation: Option (3) is correct because concrete framing is the most common type of construction today for high-rise apartment buildings. This is because most high-rise residential buildings normally require a two-hour fire-rating for floors and columns and concrete will achieve this rating without any additional protection for most applications. Options (1), (2), and (4) are incorrect."
"Question 727: Under the Strata Property Act, strata corporations are obligated to do certain things. Which of the following is NOT a duty the strata corporation is obliged to carry out? 
(1)The maintenance of property insurance on the common property 
(2)The creation of an operating fund for common expenses 
(3)The maintenance of property insurance on the common property 
(4)The establishment of a contingency reserve fund",Answer: 3 Explanation: Option (3) is correct because it is the owner’s responsibility to comply with work orders from public authorities in respect of a strata lot. This is why section 85 of the Strata Corporation Act requires owners to reimburse the strata corporation for the cost of work done by the strata corporation following the owner’s failure to comply with a work order from a public or local authority under section 85 of the Act. Option (1) is incorrect because the Strata Property Act requires the strata corporation to obtain and maintain full-replacement-value property insurance against harm to the common property. Option (2) is incorrect because the Strata Property Act requires every strata corporation to have an operating fund for common expenses that usually occur one or more times each year. Option (4) is incorrect because the Strata Property Act requires every strata corporation to establish a contingency reserve fund for expenses that usually occur less often than once a year or that do not usually occur.
"Question 728: Deborah is a trading services licensee. After providing her best estimate with respect to the value of Susan’s property, Deborah lists the property at $600,000. Jennifer, who has learned that Susan’s property is situated in the middle of an area to be redeveloped, immediately comes to Deborah with a full-price, subject-free, offer. In response to Deborah’s surprise reaction to the offer, Jennifer acknowledges that a redevelopment of the area is intended. Deborah does not advise Susan of the redevelopment as it might jeopardize the deal and, in any event, she feels that a redevelopment might cause the value of Susan’s property to decrease rather than rise. Susan accepts Jennifer’s offer and is delighted that the property sold so quickly. Which of the following statements is TRUE? 
(1)Susan does not have any claim against Deborah because she received the full listing price for her property. 
(2)If Deborah had advised Susan of the redevelopment, she would have breached the duty that she owed to Jennifer. 
(3)Susan does not have any claim against Deborah because she received the full listing price for her property. 
(4)As long as Deborah honestly believed that the offer was fair, she has satisfied her duty to Susan.","Answer: 3 Explanation: Option (3) is correct because Deborah, as Susan’s agent, owed Susan a duty to make complete disclosure of everything relevant to the transaction within Deborah’s knowledge. Regardless of whether or not Deborah thought that the redevelopment would increase or decrease the value of the property, Deborah had a duty to advise Susan of the redevelopment because it might in some way have affected Susan’s decision. Option (4) is incorrect for the same reason. Option (1) is incorrect because, where an agent has breached any duties to the principal, which Deborah has done, the agent’s right to commission will probably be lost. Therefore, Susan likely does have a claim against Deborah for the commission paid to Susan. In addition, Susan may have a potential claim against Deborah if she can prove that the property could have been sold for more had Deborah advised her of the redevelopment. Option (2) is incorrect because, in this scenario, Deborah did not owe a duty to Jennifer (a third party) not to advise Susan of the redevelopment."
"Question 729: The Local Government Act creates three different levels of local law. Which of the following is NOT one of these levels of local law? 
(1)Local improvement district 
(2)Local enterprise zone 
(3)Local improvement district 
(4)Municipality","Answer: 2 Explanation: Option (2) is correct because local enterprise zones are not a level of local law created under the Local Government Act. Options (1), (3), and (4) are incorrect because these are all levels of local government."
"Question 730: Luke and Alan are co-owners of a property, as tenants in common. They signed an agreement that stated that if either party wanted to sell their interest, the other party would have a right of first refusal to purchase the other party’s interest. Alan discovers that Luke has entered into a contract to sell his interest, without offering Alan an opportunity to purchase the property, as previously agreed. What should Alan do at this time? 
(1)Alan should a file a Certificate of Pending Litigation on the property. 
(2)Alan should register a caveat on the property. 
(3)Alan should a file a Certificate of Pending Litigation on the property. 
(4)Alan should hire a bailiff to take possession of the property.","Answer: 2 Explanation: Option (2) is correct because Alan should register a caveat, which will prevent the transfer of the property, and stay on the register for two months. This will give Alan time to commence a court action, if he so chooses. Option (1) is incorrect because Luke is not yet able to file a Certificate of Pending Litigation, because a court action has not yet been commenced. Option (3) is incorrect because Alan has not yet obtained a judgment against Luke, and thus is not able to register a judgment. Option (4) is incorrect because Alan has not obtained an Order of Possession, and thus is not yet entitled to hire a bailiff."
"Question 731: Vanna has agreed to sell her cottage to Pat. Vanna and Pat used a standard contract of purchase and sale, in which they agreed to the following dates: Completion Date: August 31, 2018 | Adjustment Date: January 1, 2019. Based on this information, which of the following statements is TRUE? 
(1)There will be no adjustment for property taxes on the buyer’s statement of adjustments. 
(2)The property taxes will appear as a credit on the buyer’s statement of adjustments. 
(3)There will be no adjustment for property taxes on the buyer’s statement of adjustments. 
(4)The property taxes will appear as a debit on the seller’s statement of adjustments.","Answer: 1 Explanation: Option (1) is correct because the buyer in a real estate transaction assumes responsibility for the taxes from the adjustment date onwards. Since Pat is assuming responsibility for the taxes on January 1, the first day of the year, no adjustment is necessary. Remember that property taxes are paid for a calendar year, even though they are usually due on July 1. Options (2), (3), and (4) are incorrect, because no adjustment is necessary for property taxes in this scenario, and therefore property taxes will not appear as a debit or credit on either the buyer’s or seller’s statement of adjustments."
"Question 732: In the context of appraisal, which one of the following properties is MOST likely to possess latent value? 
(1)A 30-acre dairy farm in the Agricultural Land Reserve 
(2)A recently constructed duplex unit in a single-family residential area of the city 
(3)A 30-acre dairy farm in the Agricultural Land Reserve 
(4)A farmhouse situated on land zoned for commercial use","Answer: 4 Explanation: Option (4) is the correct answer (and Options (1), (2), and (3) are incorrect) as the farmhouse situated on land zoned for commercial use is likely to be the only option that has redevelopment potential."
"Question 733: In the comparative approach of appraisal, one method of making final adjustments to price is to use a rating grid. In using a rating grid, it is MOST important that: 
(1)the subject property be the basis of comparison and all comparables be adjusted to it. 
(2)the final market value be determined by averaging the comparable sale prices (after adjustments). 
(3)the subject property be the basis of comparison and all comparables be adjusted to it. 
(4)the comparable properties have the same lot size as the subject property.","Answer: 1 Explanation: Option (1) is correct because when using a rating grid, the subject property is the standard of comparison and each comparable sale is adjusted to it. The subject property is not adjusted to the comparables nor are the comparables adjusted to each other. Option (2) is incorrect because the correct approach is to determine which comparable is most like the subject property and use that as main evidence for the final market value, not to average the value of the comparable sale prices. Option (3) is incorrect because the comparable properties do not require the same square footage of improvements as the subject property. Option (4) is incorrect because the comparable properties need not have the same lot size as the subject property."
"Question 734: You have a partially completed appraisal report that you need to fill in. The 2,500 square foot subject property has an alarm system. The house next door is similar in all respects except for the square footage and alarm system. The 2,700 square foot comparable sold for $236,500 and does not have an alarm system. If the market value of an alarm system is $4,500 and, above a 2,000 sq. ft. benchmark, each 100 sq. ft. is worth $6,000, this comparable will have to be adjusted for an alarm system and square footage by: 
(1)$0 and –$6,000 respectively. 
(2)–$4,500 and +$6,000 respectively. 
(3)$0 and –$6,000 respectively. 
(4)+$4,500 and –$12,000 respectively.","Answer: 4 Explanation: Option (4) is correct and Options (1), (2), and (3) are incorrect because since the comparable does not have an alarm system and the subject property does, there is a +$4,500 adjustment for the alarm system. In addition, since the subject property has 200 square feet less than the comparable, an adjustment for –$12,000 is also required."
"Question 735: Which one of the following statements is FALSE? 
(1)The principle on which the comparative approach of appraisal rests is that the price paid for a commodity will be equal to the cost of acquiring a substitute in the same circumstances. 
(2)In the comparative approach of appraisal, “recent” refers to the period immediately preceding the appraisal date during which values have remained stable. 
(3)The principle on which the comparative approach of appraisal rests is that the price paid for a commodity will be equal to the cost of acquiring a substitute in the same circumstances. 
(4)If the adjusted sale prices of five comparables are $100,000, $90,000, $95,000, $100,000, and $100,000, the appraiser could estimate the market value of the subject property to be $100,000.","Answer: 3 Explanation: Option (3) is correct (false) because the value of the comparable must be adjusted downwards to account for the benefit provided by the below-market vendor financing. Options (1), (2), and (4) are incorrect because they are true."
"Question 736: You have a partially completed appraisal report that you need to fill in. The 2,200 square foot subject property has 4 bedrooms and 4 bathrooms. The house next door is similar in all respects except for square footage, the number of bedrooms, and the number of bathrooms. The 2,300 square foot comparable sold for $245,000 and has 3 bedrooms and 3 bathrooms. If the market value of a bedroom is $4,000, the market value of a bathroom is $5,700, and above a 1,900 sq. ft. benchmark, each 100 sq. ft. is worth $6,000, the adjusted sale price for this comparable is: 
(1)$248,700 
(2)$260,700 
(3)$248,700 
(4)$241,300","Answer: 1 Explanation: Option (1) is correct because to find the adjusted sale price of the comparable, take the sum of the listed sale price with its adjustments to the subject property. In this case, the subject property and the comparable are identical except that the subject property has 1 additional bedroom, 1 additional bathroom, and 100 square feet less. The adjusted sale price is: $245,000 + $4,000 +$5,700 – $6,000 = $248,700. Options (2), (3), and (4) are therefore incorrect."
"Question 737: Which of the following is a current asset on the financial statement of a business? 
(1)Owner’s initial investment 
(2)Rents payable 
(3)Owner’s initial investment 
(4)Sales revenue","Answer: 3 Explanation: Option (3) is correct because marketable securities is the only account listed that is classified as a current asset. Option (1) represents an owner’s equity account, Option (2) represents a current liability account, and Option (4) represents a revenue account."
"Question 738: Which of the following is defined as a form of online mapping that incorporates several layers of information? 
(1)Multilayered Mapping System (MMS) 
(2)Stacked Data System (SDS) mapping 
(3)Multilayered Mapping System (MMS) 
(4)Regional Integrated System (RIS) mapping","Answer: 3 Explanation: Option (3) is correct because geographic information system (GIS) mapping is a form of computer-based mapping that incorporates several layers of information beyond what a traditional map can tell you. GIS maps can integrate details on lot size and dimensions, zoning bylaws applicable to the parcel, ownership details, environmental restrictions, etc. Options (1), (2), and (4) do not perform this function."
"Question 739: With which one of the following loans is the lender’s initial capital and periodic income at the greatest risk? 
(1)Interest only loans 
(2)Interest accruing loans 
(3)Interest only loans 
(4)Constant payment loans","Answer: 2 Explanation: Option (2) is correct because an interest accruing loan represents the greatest risk to the lender, since the entire amount of principal and interest is at risk for the entire length of the term. Options (1), (3), and (4) represent loans with lesser risk to the lender."
"Question 740: Which of the following statements regarding depreciation expense is TRUE? 
(1)It is another name for capital cost allowance. 
(2)It is an accounting concept that attempts to allocate the cost of an asset over the life of the asset. 
(3)It is another name for capital cost allowance. 
(4)It is the amount the Income Tax Act permits a taxpayer to deduct from income in determining taxable income.","Answer: 2 Explanation: Option (2) is correct because depreciation expense is an accounting concept that attempts to allocate the cost of an asset over the life of the asset. Option (1) is incorrect because capital cost allowance and depreciation expense are separate frameworks that both attempt to allocate the cost of an asset over the asset’s life. The difference is that depreciation expense is used for financial statements, and capital cost allowance is used for tax deductions. Option (3) is incorrect because land is not a depreciable asset. Option (4) is incorrect because this option describes the CCA framework."

(3)must not terminate the offer until the 24 hours has expired. 
(4)must give at least 72 hours’ notice to the offeree before revoking the offer.","Answer: 2 Explanation: Option (2) is correct because revocation must always be actually communicated to be effective. Option (1) is incorrect because an offeror can revoke their offer at any time prior to acceptance, regardless of whether or not the previously stated time limit has expired.

(2)lawful if the agreement is reduced to writing and signed by both parties. 
(3)contrary to the Real Estate Services Act.

"Question 758: Assume that you have a $100,000 mortgage loan at a rate of 10% per annum, compounded semi-annually over a 5-year amortization with monthly payments. If the amortization period of a loan is increased to 10 years and the remaining loan terms are unchanged: 
(1)the interest portion of the periodic payments will be reduced. 
(2)the amount of outstanding principal at any point in time will be increased. 
(3)the interest portion of the periodic payments will be reduced. 
(4)there is reduced risk to the lender.","Answer: 2 Explanation: Lengthening the amortization period means that more time is allowed for the borrower to pay off the loan. For constant payment mortgage loans, the initial first payments are composed of a greater portion of interest, whereas the last payments are composed of a greater portion of principal payments. Below is an example demonstrating changes in amortization. This example has a 5-year amortization period; calculate OSB24.

Therefore, Option (2) is correct. Your payments have decreased and you are stretching out the time needed to pay of off the loan. You are paying more interest, and since interest is paid more at the beginning than at the end of the loan, your payments on principal are delayed; therefore, at each point in time, the amount outstanding on your principal will be greater."

Option (2) is incorrect because the strata corporation includes all of the individual strata owners, not just elected representatives. Option (3) is incorrect because strata owners own privately owned (divided) strata lots in fee simple, and own common property as tenants in common.

Option (1) is incorrect because a landlord may end a tenancy if the tenant or a person permitted on the residential property by the tenant has significantly interfered with or unreasonably disturbed another occupant or the landlord of the residential property. Option (3) is incorrect because a landlord may end a tenancy if rent is a tenant is repeatedly late paying rent.

(3)The trustee is the individual or entity in whose name the trust property is held. 
(4)The trustee is the government agency that is appointed to administer the assets of all persons in British Columbia who become incapable of managing their own affairs.","Answer: 1 Explanation: Option (1) is correct because a trustee is an individual or entity in whose name a property is held, in trust for the benefit of another person, known as the beneficiary. Option (2) is incorrect because the person who the property is held for the benefit of is known as the beneficiary. Option (3) is incorrect because while an executor may seek assistance in handling a transfer of title from an estate, the title will normally be put into the name of the executor, rather than a financial institution.

(1)Karl must remove his cat; the bylaw is enforceable against him. 
(2)Jane will not be subject to the new bylaw because she had a dog before the bylaw was passed. 
(3)Karl must remove his cat; the bylaw is enforceable against him. 
(4)The Schedule of Standard Bylaws allows an owner one dog or one cat, and therefore Karl and Jane can keep their pets.","Answer: 4 Explanation: Option (4) is correct because the Standard Bylaws can be amended by a strata corporation passing their own bylaw restricting pets, and is therefore false. Option (1) is incorrect because Karl purchased his lot after the bylaw was passed, and is therefore true. Option (2) is incorrect because bylaws prohibiting pets do not apply to pets living with an owner, tenant, or occupant at the time the bylaw is passed, and is therefore true. Option (3) is incorrect because the Strata Property Act allows for pet restriction bylaws to be passed, and is therefore true."

(1)Howard is a trespasser; therefore, Laura does not owe him a duty of care under the Occupiers Liability Act. 
(2)If Laura had taken reasonable and responsible precautions, such as applying sand or salt regularly to prevent ice building up on the driveway, she will likely not be liable to Howard under the Occupiers Liability Act. 
(3)Howard is a trespasser; therefore, Laura does not owe him a duty of care under the Occupiers Liability Act. 
(4)Laura will be liable to Howard for all his damages even if she was not negligent.","Answer: 2 Explanation: Option (2) is correct because section 3(1) of the Occupiers Liability Act requires an occupier of premises to take that care that in all the circumstances is reasonable to see that a person will be reasonably safe in using the premises. By taking these steps, it is likely that Laura met the requisite standard of care and would not be liable. Option (1) is incorrect because an occupier owes a duty of care under the Occupiers Liability Act even to trespassers, unless they are trespassing while committing or having the intention to commit a criminal act. Option (3) is incorrect because an occupier is defined in the Occupiers Liability Act as a person who is in physical possession of premises, and does not depend on the length of the lease. Option (4) is incorrect because Laura will only be liable to Howard for his damages if she breached the standard of care owed to Howard, making her negligent."

(1)a charge. 
(2)an agreement for sale. 
(3)a charge. 
(4)a restrictive covenant.","Answer: 1 Explanation: Option (1) is correct because in British Columbia, under the Torrens system of land title registration, all mortgages are registered as charges against the title.

Option (1) is incorrect because a contract can be discharged by an agreement between the parties to waive full compliance with the terms of the contract. Option (2) is incorrect because a contract can be discharged by frustration. Option (3) is incorrect because once the final act of performance occurs, the contract is discharged."
"Question 778: Larry owns a large gift shop. For the past eight years, Marie, a jeweller, has leased an area in the back room for use as a workshop. Larry and Marie have an oral agreement that Marie will only use the workshop area during weekday mornings when the gift shop is not busy, so as not to disturb customers with the noise of her work. Marie pays $350 each month to Larry for this right. Larry has sold the shop to Theo for use as a restaurant, but he is uncertain what to do about his long-term tenant. You correctly advise Larry that: 
(1)the Commercial Tenancy Act requires that “reasonable notice” of a least six months be given to Marie of Larry’s intention to terminate the tenancy. 
(2)in order for Marie to enforce this agreement against Theo, it must be in writing and registered in the Land Title Office. 
(3)the Commercial Tenancy Act requires that “reasonable notice” of a least six months be given to Marie of Larry’s intention to terminate the tenancy. 
(4)the agreement is not enforceable against Larry because it does not meet the requirements of the Real Estate Services Act.","Answer: 3 Explanation: Option (3) is correct because a licence is a contractual agreement and so does not “run with the land” and bind successors in title as an interest in land would. The distinction between a licence and a lease is based on intention based on whether the parties to the agreement intend to grant an interest in land, or simply create a licence to occupy. Option (1) is incorrect because Larry granted a licence, not a lease. Option (2) is incorrect because the agreement is a licence and therefore is not enforceable against successors. Option (4) is incorrect because the agreement is a licence."

The British Columbia Financial Services Authority (BCFSA) is instituting a formal disciplinary hearing to investigate the situation and both Kenneth and the representative have received the notice of hearing. Kenneth does not think that BCFSA can discipline him and is angry that he is being held responsible for his representative’s conduct. Which of the following statements is FALSE? 
(1)BCFSA has the authority to subject Kenneth to a disciplinary hearing for the action of his representative, under the powers granted to BCFSA by the Real Estate Services Act. 
(2)The representative cannot be disciplined jointly with Kenneth; only Kenneth will bear responsibility for a breach of the Real Estate Services Act by his employee. 
(3)BCFSA has the authority to subject Kenneth to a disciplinary hearing for the action of his representative, under the powers granted to BCFSA by the Real Estate Services Act. 
(4)If BCFSA imposes a discipline order on Kenneth, the Real Estate Services Act requires that BCFSA publish this order on its website and provide copies to any person upon request.","Answer: 2 Explanation: Option (2) is correct because both a broker and a representative employed by the broker can be disciplined jointly. Option (1) is incorrect because the Real Estate Services Act grants power to the British Columbia Financial Services Authority (BCFSA) to subject brokers to disciplinary hearings for the actions of their representatives, and therefore is true. Option (3) is incorrect because section 43 of the Real Estate Services Act allows for the suspension of the broker’s licence, and is therefore true. Option (4) is incorrect because the Real Estate Services Act requires that BCFSA publish all orders on its website and provide copies to any person upon request, and is therefore true."

"Question 781: In which of the following scenarios would the profit, or capital gain, realized upon the sale of property be MOST likely to be completely exempt from taxation? 
(1)The seller purchased the property as a long-term investment. 
(2)The seller purchased the property in order to “flip” the real estate by selling it quickly for a profit. 
(3)The seller purchased the property as a long-term investment. 
(4)The seller purchased the property to live in as their principal residence.","Answer: 4 Explanation: Option (4) is correct because capital gains are exempt from taxation where the property sold was the seller’s principal residence. Options (1), (2), and (3) are incorrect because they do not fall within the principal residence exception, and either 50 or 100% of the profit realized on the sale of the property would be taxed depending on whether it is considered a true capital gain or instead, business income."

(1)the plaintiff is a limited company. 
(2)the defendant is without means. 
(3)the plaintiff is a limited company. 
(4)the contract has already been partially performed.","Answer: 3 Explanation: Option (3) is correct because specific performance is an equitable remedy granted at the discretion of the court and will not be exercised when damages are considered to be an adequate remedy. Option (1) is incorrect because a limited company can be granted specific performance at the court’s discretion. Option (2) is incorrect because a court can award specific performance if a defendant is without means. Option (4) is incorrect because even if the contract has already been partially performed, the court still has the discretion to award specific performance."

(1)A corporation can be sued. 
(2)The shareholders of a corporation cannot be held responsible for more than their agreed share purchase. 
(3)A corporation can be sued. 
(4)A corporation is a taxable entity.","Answer: 3 Explanation: Option (3) is correct because a corporation is owned by one or more shareholders. Option (1) is incorrect because a corporation is a separate legal entity, and so can be sued just as a natural person can be. Option (2) is incorrect because shareholders are liable only for the value of the shares purchased or agreed to be purchased, and have no further responsibility for the debts of the company once the cost of their shares have been fully paid.

Option (1) is incorrect because this is a substantial clause commonly used which states that the mortgagor will duly pay all taxes, levies and assessments whatsoever affecting the land and all premiums for insurance effected pursuant to this mortgage. Option (2) is incorrect because this is a substantial clause commonly used which states that the mortgagor will keep the land and the buildings thereof in good condition and repair, and he will not abandon or commit waste upon the same.

She has now sold her home and left for Winnipeg.","Answer: 2 Explanation: Option (2) is the best evidence of market value due to the similarity and recency of the sale. Option (1) is incorrect because the list price of the property is a subjective value, and appraisers are interested in the objective value that arises from a sale.

Since each unit is priced at $132,000 and the mortgage loan is for $102,000, the down payment is $30,000.

(3)An appeal from all courts of original jurisdiction in British Columbia, including small claims court, is to the British Columbia Court of Appeal. 
(4)An appeal from small claims court is heard by three, five, or seven judges.",Answer: 2 Explanation: Option (2) is correct. Option (1) is incorrect because an appeal from the small claims court is taken to the British Columbia Supreme Court. Option (3) is incorrect because the Supreme Court of Canada can decide not to hear an appeal from the BC Court of Appeal.

"Question 794: Which of the following BEST describes the principle of indefeasibility in British Columbia? 
(1)Once a break in the chain of title has occurred, all subsequent transfers or other dealings with the land are of no effect, even though the transactions have been made in good faith and for value. 
(2)The purchase of property from someone who has no ownership right to it also denies the purchaser any ownership title. 
(3)Once a break in the chain of title has occurred, all subsequent transfers or other dealings with the land are of no effect, even though the transactions have been made in good faith and for value. 
(4)If a person is named by the previous owner as the new owner of any estate in land, then that is conclusive proof, as far as the world is concerned, that they are entitled to that estate.","Answer: 3 Explanation: Option (3) is correct because, in British Columbia, the indefeasibility principle means that any registered owner who acquires a fee simple estate in good faith (honestly) and for valuable consideration (a reasonable price, given the circumstances and market value) is protected by our land title system. In other words, if a person is named on a certificate of title as the owner of the fee simple estate in land, then that is conclusive proof, as far as the world is concerned, that he or she is entitled to that fee simple estate. Option (1) is incorrect because it describes the common law doctrine of the void deed which was overruled by the principle of indefeasibility. Option (2) is incorrect because it also describes the common law doctrine of the void deed, which is sometimes referred to as nemo dat quad non habet, or “one cannot give what one does not have”.

(2)The structural member, usually wood, placed at the top of window openings 
(3)Roof extensions used to provide extra floor area and windows for the upper level 
(4)The structural member that supports the roof deck","Answer: 4 Explanation: Option (4) is correct because a rafter is the structural member that supports the roof deck. Option (1) refers to a dormer, Option (2) refers to a header, and Option (3) refers to a specific roof style."
"Question 799: In the process model for buying behaviour, which of the following is the initial need or trigger that starts the buying process? 
(1)Motive 
(2)Buyer’s trigger 
(3)Motive 
(4)Felt need","Answer: 4 Explanation: Option (4) is correct because the process model of buying behaviour helps explain how consumers go about the purchase of shopping goods (i.e., real estate services) and looks at the buying process from the consumer’s perspective. A felt need is the initial need or trigger that starts the buying process. In real estate, many events can trigger the felt need to buy or sell a property. Options (1), (2), and (3) are incorrect because they are not the correct term for this initial trigger in the process model for buying behaviour."

(1)Informational message 
(2)Persuasive message 
(3)Informational message 
(4)Reminder-oriented message","Answer: 4 Explanation: Option (4) is correct because reminder-oriented messages focus on keeping the product, service, or licensee at the consumer’s “top-of-mind.” Option (1) is incorrect because informational messages are designed to provide information and create awareness. Option (2) is incorrect because persuasive messages are aimed at generating a response from the recipient, such as making a phone call or sending an e-mail. Option (3) is incorrect because appeal message is a term not used in this course."
"Question 801: Which one of the following statements correctly describes the manner in which taxes are adjusted? 
(1)If the seller has already paid the current year’s taxes, the seller must be debited with the taxes from the adjustment date to December 31st. 
(2)If the taxes are overdue and a penalty is owing, both the amount of the taxes and the penalty must be apportioned between the buyer and the seller. 
(3)If the seller has already paid the current year’s taxes, the seller must be debited with the taxes from the adjustment date to December 31st. 
(4)None of the above","Answer: 4 Explanation: Option (4) is correct. Option (1) is incorrect because if the seller has already paid the current year’s taxes, the seller must be reimbursed for that portion of the year from and including the adjustment date. This will be a debit to the buyer and a credit to the seller. Option (2) is incorrect because the seller is responsible for the full amount of any penalty. It is not adjusted because only the seller was liable to pay and failed to do so in a timely manner. The buyer would be debited their portion of taxes from the adjustment date to December 31, and the seller would be credited the buyer’s portion of taxes and debited the whole year’s taxes due plus any late penalties. Option (3) is incorrect because if the taxes are not yet due, an estimate of the charge will have to be made."
"Question 802: You have a partially completed appraisal report that you need to fill in. The house next door to the subject property is similar in all respects except for the number of bedrooms and numbers of bathrooms. This comparable has 3 bedrooms and 4 bathrooms and was adjusted +$4,200 for bedrooms and –$2,600 for bathrooms. If the market value of a bedroom is $4,200 and the market value of a bathroom is $2,600, it can be concluded that the subject property has: 
(1)4 bedrooms and 3 bathrooms. 
(2)4 bedrooms and 2 bathrooms. 
(3)4 bedrooms and 3 bathrooms. 
(4)3 bedrooms and 2 bathrooms.","Answer: 1 Explanation: Option (1) is correct because the value of the subject property calls for the adjustment of +$4,200 and we know that the market value of one bedroom is $4,200. So if the subject property is adjusted up by $4,200, we know that the subject property must have one more bedroom than the comparable (4 bedrooms in subject). There is a –$2,600 adjustment for bathrooms; therefore, the subject property has one less bathroom than the comparable (3 bathrooms in subject). Therefore, Options (2), (3), and (4) are incorrect."
"Question 803: In using the comparative approach of appraisal, the appraiser estimates the value from the evidence afforded by the sale price of similar properties that have recently been sold. Which of the following BEST describes what is meant by “similar”? 
(1)Similar in replacement cost 
(2)Similar in price bracket 
(3)Similar in replacement cost 
(4)Similar with respect to those factors that are likely to have a material influence on the behaviour of buyers and sellers","Answer: 4 Explanation: Option (4) is correct because in the comparative approach of appraisal, it is most important that the subject building and the comparable buildings be similar with respect to factors judged important by buyers and sellers. Options (1), (2), and (3) are incorrect because similarity is only required for those factors that have a material influence on buyers and sellers, and the sale prices they negotiate."
"Question 804: Which of the following statements about the fee simple estate is TRUE? 
(1)The term “fee” means that the rights exercisable by the holder of a fee simple estate have been acquired by a payment of money. 
(2)Where the owner of a fee simple estate dies without a will, the property will “escheat” to the Crown. 
(3)The term “fee” means that the rights exercisable by the holder of a fee simple estate have been acquired by a payment of money. 
(4)A fee simple estate is an estate that is held for a limited period of time.","Answer: 3 Explanation: Option (3) is correct because an owner of a fee simple estate has the greatest bundle of rights over his or her land that can be held in Canada, which includes the right to sell, rent, or lease the estate. Option (1) is incorrect because the term “fee” means that the estate can be inherited. Option (2) is incorrect because if the owner of a fee simple estate dies without a will, the owner’s heirs will inherit the estate in fee simple with the priority of the heirs being determined by the laws of intestate succession. Option (4) is incorrect because a fee simple estate has rights to the land for so long as he or she has heirs."
"Question 805: Which of the following statements concerning the equitable jurisdiction of the court is TRUE? 
(1)Where the rules of equity and common law conflict, the court will apply the common law rule. 
(2)Equitable remedies are available to parties in a court action as of right, regardless of their conduct. 
(3)Where the rules of equity and common law conflict, the court will apply the common law rule. 
(4)Specific performance, injunctions, and legal damages are three types of equitable remedies.","Answer: 3 Explanation: Option (3) is correct.

(3)is enforceable by a court only if the lease is in writing and registered in the Land Title Office as required by the Land Title Act. 
(4)is generally a landlord’s obligation unless the lease specifies otherwise.","Answer: 2 Explanation: Option (2) is correct because unlike in residential tenancies, there is no general obligation on either the landlord or tenant to repair commercial premises. Option (1) is incorrect because the contract does not have to be registered to be enforceable between the parties. Option (3) is incorrect because there is an implied covenant that the tenant will deliver up the premises as he or she found them, fair wear and tear excepted. Option (4) is incorrect because there is no obligation on the landlord to repair."

(1)Deposit

(3)Deposit 
(4)Description of the price and financing","Answer: 1 Explanation: Option (1) is correct because a deposit is not required in order for a contract of purchase and sale to be enforceable.

"Question 809: Which of the following statements about periodic tenancies is TRUE? 
(1)Where a periodic tenancy is created as a result of a tenant overholding a fixed term commercial lease, the resulting periodic tenancy will be on all the same terms as the fixed term lease except the rent will be increased by ten percent. 
(2)Where a periodic tenancy is created at the end of a fixed term commercial lease of five years, the new periodic tenancy will always be for a term of five years. 
(3)Where a periodic tenancy is created as a result of a tenant overholding a fixed term commercial lease, the resulting periodic tenancy will be on all the same terms as the fixed term lease except the rent will be increased by ten percent. 
(4)Where a fixed-term residential tenancy expires, it will automatically convert to a month-to-month periodic tenancy unless the parties have agreed in writing that it will not do so, at the time they entered into a fixed term tenancy agreement.","Answer: 4 Explanation: Option (4) is correct because fixed-term residential tenancies automatically convert to a month-to-month periodic tenancy unless the parties have agreed in writing otherwise. Option (1) is incorrect because the resulting periodic tenancy does not include a rent increase of ten percent. Option (2) is incorrect because if the rent was expressed yearly, the new implied tenancy would be from year-to-year. Option (3) is incorrect because a periodic commercial tenancy can be terminated by either party by giving “reasonable” notice to the other."
"Question 810: Which one of the following is NOT a primary motivation for investment in real estate? 
(1)Diversification of an investment portfolio 
(2)Acquisition of a portfolio, the income from which will benefit the investor in retirement years 
(3)Diversification of an investment portfolio 
(4)A desire for accommodation for residential or economic activities","Answer: 3 Explanation: Option (3) is the correct answer as it is the only option listed that is not a motivation to invest in real estate. Investing in real estate is typically long term, and requires a high outlay of capital, so it will not provide short-term funds to acquire chattels.

(1)Change the common law 
(2)Develop a system of precedent 
(3)Change the common law 
(4)Publicize an important judicial decision","Answer: 1 Explanation: Option (1) is correct because the role most often played by legislation is to change the common law. Option (2) is incorrect because the common law develops a system of precedent. Option (3) is incorrect because the power of the government to make laws is set out in our Constitution, which cannot be amended by an ordinary statute. Option (4) is incorrect because legislation is not used as a means to publicize important judicial decisions."

(1)the value of the traded property is listed as a credit to the buyer and a debit to the seller. 
(2)the value of the traded property will appear on the seller’s statement of adjustments only. 
(3)the value of the traded property is listed as a credit to the buyer and a debit to the seller. 
(4)the value of the traded property is listed as a debit to the buyer and a credit to the seller.","Answer: 1 Explanation: Option (1) is correct because this transfer of personal property is a credit to the buyer as it reduces the amount that the buyer owes, and is a debit to the seller as it reduces the amount of cash proceeds of sale due to the seller. Options (2) and (3) are incorrect because this transfer will appear on the statement of adjustment of both the buyer and seller. Option (4) is incorrect because a debit to the buyer would increase the amount owed to the seller, and a credit to the seller increases the cash the seller will receive on closing."
"Question 814: When determining the rights of a tenant of residential premises, which of the following sources of law must the parties look to? 
(1)The Commercial Tenancy Act 
(2)The common law 
(3)The Commercial Tenancy Act 
(4)None of the above","Answer: 2 Explanation: Option (2) is correct because the common law provides tenants with various rights such the right to quiet enjoyment and the right to derogation from grant.

(3)Purchase price, conveyancing fees, and balance due to complete 
(4)Buyer’s share of taxes paid, purchase price, and conveyancing fees",Answer: 4 Explanation: Option (4) is correct because these are all amounts owed by the buyer. Option (1) is incorrect because the balance due to complete is a credit on the buyer’s statement of adjustments.

"Question 818: Garth has agreed to buy Whiteacre from Elisa for $448,000. Property taxes are not yet due. The taxes last year were $1,324 and the notary public has told Garth to expect a 10% increase in that amount for the current year. The completion and adjustment dates are February 18. It is NOT a leap year. The property tax amount to be paid by Elisa will appear on her statement of adjustments as a: 
(1)debit in the amount of $174.12 
(2)credit in the amount of $1,264.87 
(3)debit in the amount of $174.12 
(4)debit in the amount of $191.53","Answer: 4 Explanation: Option (4) is correct because Elisa is responsible for 48/365 days for property taxes as the buyer is responsible for the adjustment date. The total property taxes is estimated to be $1324 × 1.1 = $1456.40. Therefore, Elisa’s portion is $1456.40 × (48/365) = $191.53. This is a debit on the seller’s statement of adjustments as it will reduce the cash proceeds due to her. Option (1) is incorrect because this value does not reflect the expected 10% increase in the current year’s property taxes. Options (2) and (3) are incorrect because the seller’s portion of the property taxes appears as a debit on the seller’s statement as it reduces the cash proceeds due to the seller."

This will give us the amount to be depreciated. The straight-line depreciation expense equals the amount to be depreciated divided by the number of years."
"Question 834: Freddy May Ltd. purchased a small commercial building for $225,000, of which $100,000 was the value of the land.

"Question 845: Larry is a real estate licensee. During negotiations for the sale of a property with a well water system, the buyer asked how reliable a water source the well was.

Option (2) is incorrect because the seller does have a duty to disclose this defect to the buyer because it is likely a latent defect. Option (3) is incorrect because the seller can still be liable for misrepresentation because there is a relationship between the seller and the buyer giving rise to a duty of care."
"Question 846: Which of the following statements is TRUE?

Option (1) is incorrect because the Law and Equity Act writing requirement applies even when a buyer and seller agree on the terms of the sale. Option (2) is incorrect because a contract not in writing is not void, but may be unenforceable. Option (4) is incorrect because if the party denying the contract has done some act that indicates the contract was made, they will be “estopped” from denying its existence."

(4)If Harvey telephones Mary to ask whether she intends to live on the property herself, Mary’s original offer is terminated.","Answer: 3 Explanation: Option (3) is correct because making a substantial change to Mary’s offer would be considered a counter-offer. The counter-offer becomes the new offer, which terminates the original offer. Option (1) is incorrect because if acceptance by mail is appropriate, then the “postal acceptance rule” applies, making the acceptance effective as soon as it is put in the mailbox, rather when it is actually received. Option (2) is incorrect because the party who made the offer can revoke it at any time before it is accepted.

They have determined that the house has a lending value of $208,000 and annual property taxes are $1,900. Ripley uses a policy of requiring a 30% gross debt service ratio and will lend to a maximum of 80% loan-to-value. In the calculation of gross income, Ripley includes 100% of the principal wage earner’s income and 75% of the secondary wage earner’s income. Calculate the maximum loan the Mortgagors can expect (rounded to the nearest dollar).

(2)$166,400 
(3)$174,856 
(4)$150,006","Answer: 2 Explanation: For this question, calculate the mortgage amount based on the two constraints of the loan-to-value and debt service ratio. The maximum loan allowable will be the amount that satisfies both constraints: therefore, it is the lower amount of the two. LTV = 80%"

Option (1) is incorrect because the Constitution Act, 1867 gave the provincial government jurisdiction over matters affecting private property, not the federal government. Option (2) is incorrect because although the province has delegated most authority to regulate land use to local governments, the provincial government has maintained certain power such as through the Agricultural Land Commission Act. Option (4) is incorrect because the Heritage Conservation Act also gives local governments the authority to impose restrictions on a private landowner’s use of their land."
"Question 854: Two neighbours, Ms. Finch and Mr. Falcon, each sold their homes last week. Ms. Finch sold her house for $150,000, while Mr. Falcon’s house only sold for $132,000.

Option (4) is incorrect because a tenant can assign a commercial lease even if the lease permits subletting the premises."
"Question 856: Which of the following statements concerning the common law doctrine of the void deed is TRUE? 
(1)A current fee simple “owner” under a void deed has no remedy other than to seek compensation from the government. 
(2)A void deed would cause all subsequent transfers of the land to be of no effect, even if made in good faith and for value. 
(3)A current fee simple “owner” under a void deed has no remedy other than to seek compensation from the government. 
(4)A current fee simple “owner” under a void deed could not have certainty of title after holding the property for 25 years.","Answer: 2 Explanation: Option (2) is correct because at common law, once a “break” in the chain of title occurred, all subsequent transfers or other dealings with the land were of no effect because of the maxim nemo dat quod non habet.

(2)one property has an attractive mountain view and the other does not. 
(3)one property has maintained the yard while the other has not. 
(4)one property was appraised during a rainstorm, the other was appraised on a clear day.","Answer: 2 Explanation: The correct answer is Option (2) because a property with a particularly attractive view may be worth much more than a property without a view. Option (1) is incorrect; the quality of aesthetic factors that can be corrected economically, such as landscaping, do not have an impact on appraised values. Option (3) is also incorrect because a one-year difference in age in a relatively new home is unlikely to have a material impact on appraised values. Option (4) is incorrect because the weather is unlikely to have a material impact on appraised values."

(1)an equitable mortgage. 
(2)an agreement of purchase and sale. 
(3)an equitable mortgage. 
(4)a disguised form of mortgage.","Answer: 3 Explanation: Option (3) is correct because in an agreement for sale, the vendor “lends” the purchaser some portion of the purchase price but remains the owner of the property.

(4)because such promises are expressly forbidden under the Real Estate Services Act.","Answer: 1 Explanation: Option (1) is correct because section 49 of the Real Estate Services Rules prohibits licensees from making a promise to buy or sell any real estate belonging to a prospective buyer unless at the time the licensee makes the promise, he or she gives a signed statement containing the details of the promise to the person to whom it is made. Option (2) is incorrect because a trading services representative does not have to have lined up a buyer for the property before making a promise to buy or sell any real estate belonging to a prospective buyer. Option (3) is incorrect because a trading services representative is not required to first obtain authorization by the brokerage before making such a promise. Option (4) is incorrect because the Real Estate Services Act does not prohibit these promises from being made."

Option (2) is incorrect because the Strata Property Act permits the strata corporation to file a lien in the land title office against a strata lot for money owing to the corporation. Option (4) is incorrect because the Strata Property Act permits a strata corporation to deny an owner, tenant, occupant, or visitor the use of the recreational facility that is common property for a reasonable length of time."

(1)expressly. 
(2)contingently. 
(3)expressly. 
(4)by ratification.","Answer: 2 Explanation: Option (2) is correct because an agent’s authority to act on behalf of his principal may not arise contingently.

"Question 868: A borrower approaches Ripley Finance Company about a mortgage on an income-producing property. The property produces an annual net operating income of $112,500. The lending value of the property is $880,000. Ripley will only lend to a maximum of 80% loan-to-value ratio, and requires a minimum debt coverage ratio of 1.25. Ripley’s terms are: j12 = 12%, a term and amortization period of 15 years, and monthly payments. Given these constraints, calculate the maximum allowable loan (rounded to the nearest dollar). 
(1)$624,912 
(2)$660,000 
(3)$624,912 
(4)$634,728","Answer: 1 Explanation: For this question, calculate the mortgage amount based on the constraints of loan-to-value and debt coverage ratio. The maximum loan allowable will be the amount that satisfies both constraints; therefore, it is the lower amount of the two. LTV constraint: $880,000 × 0.80 = $704,000 Using DCR constraint, calculate maximum allowable payments."
"Question 869: Which of the following is an example of a legal non-conforming use? 
(1)A basement suite in an area near a university that has been zoned for single family dwellings for over 20 years; the suite has been in existence for 15 years and the municipality is aware of it 
(2)A 25-year-old corner grocery store that is located in an area where the original zoning was changed from multi-family to single family two years ago 
(3)A basement suite in an area near a university that has been zoned for single family dwellings for over 20 years; the suite has been in existence for 15 years and the municipality is aware of it 
(4)A long-established factory in an area that has just been rezoned from industrial to residential","Answer: 4 Explanation: Option (4) is correct because the factory was in compliance with the industrial use permitted by the zoning bylaw when it was built, and so it will be permitted to continue as a legal non-conforming use after the area is rezoned to residential use. Option (1) is incorrect because this is an example of an illegal secondary suite. The fact that the municipality is aware of the suite does not make the suite legal; rather, the city could elect to enforce its bylaws at any time. Option (2) is incorrect because the grocery was non-compliant with the bylaw even before it was amended, so the use was never legal. Option (3) is incorrect because an addition cannot be made to a building used for a non-conforming use unless it is required by law or permitted by a board of variance."

(3)entitles a landlord to exercise the right to distrain a tenant’s goods for arrears of rent.

Option (1) is incorrect because a residential landlord cannot distrain a tenant’s goods for arrears of rent. Option (2) is incorrect because section 32 of the Residential Tenancy Act imposes an obligation on the landlord to repair all types of residential premises. Option (3) is incorrect because there is no obligation to register a lease of three years or less to secure a tenant’s rights against subsequent owners of the leased premises.
"Question 871: Which of the following statements regarding manufactured home registration is FALSE?

(4)If an owner discovers that their manufactured home is not registered, they must register the home within 30 days of that discovery.","Answer: 4 Explanation: Option (4) is correct because a manufactured home is not required to be registered. Option (1) is incorrect because under section 7 of the Manufactured Home Act, the transfer is not effective, except between the parties to the transfer, unless both the home and the transfer are registered.

(1)Issuance of real estate services licences 
(2)Conduct formal disciplinary processes 
(3)Issuance of real estate services licences 
(4)Undertaking and carrying out real estate law reform","Answer: 4 Explanation: Option (4) is correct because the undertaking and carrying out of real estate law reform is a duty of the Real Estate Foundation, not the British Columbia Financial Services Authority (BCFSA). Option (1) is incorrect because according to the Real Estate Services Act, states that BFCSA is responsible for issuing real estate licenses. Option (2) is incorrect because BCFSA may conduct investigations and hold formal disciplinary processes. Option (3) is incorrect because according to section 53.1 of the Real Estate Services Act, BCFSA may require the licensee to pay the expenses, or part of the expenses, incurred in relation to either or both of the investigation and the discipline hearing to which the order relates."

(2)The statement must have induced the buyer to enter the contract. 
(3)The statement must be one of opinion. 
(4)The statement must have been made by the seller knowing it to be false, or recklessly as to its truth or falsehood.","Answer: 1 Explanation: Option (1) is correct because a misrepresentation is a false statement of fact, not of opinion. Option (2) is incorrect because in order to be a misrepresentation that would entitle the buyer to rescind the contract, the statement must have induced the other party to enter into the contract. Option (3) is incorrect because the statement must also be one which would have induced a reasonable person to enter into the contract. Option (4) is incorrect because in order to claim damages, the seller must have known it was false, or have been reckless as to its truth or falsehood."
"Question 876: Which of the following could a defendant use as a defence to a claim in negligence against them? 
(1)The defendant did not intend to cause injury or damage to the plaintiff. 
(2)The defendant breached the standard of care owed to the plaintiff. 
(3)The defendant did not intend to cause injury or damage to the plaintiff. 
(4)The act of the defendant was authorized by statute.","Answer: 3 Explanation: Option (3) is correct because damages that are not reasonably foreseeable are considered too “remote” in law, and a plaintiff will not be able to get compensation for them. Option (1) is incorrect because a claim for negligence is concerned with whether the defendant breached the standard of care owed, not whether they intended to cause injury or damage to the plaintiff. Option (2) is incorrect because this is a required element for a successful claim of negligence. Option (4) is incorrect because even if an act was authorized by statute, a defendant could still be found negligent for the way that act was done."

Option (1) is incorrect because under the doctrine of privity of contract, only the parties to a contract can sue or be sued for its breach. Option (3) is incorrect because one exception to the doctrine of privity of contract is contracts which create an interest in land. Option (4) is incorrect because the Law and Equity Act states that a statutory assignment must be in writing, must be absolute and unconditional, and notice must be given in writing to the original promissor."
"Question 878: George bought two units in a 10-unit condominium project. Within one week of the completion of this purchase, some of the owners of another condominium unit, the Smithe family, were killed in an accident in the jacuzzi whirlpool. Mrs. Smithe was the sole survivor of this family. The pool is located on the common property in which George now owns an interest.

(1)George must pay his proportionate share of any judgment registered against the common property of the strata corporation. 
(2)George will owe Mrs. Smithe absolutely nothing as the Strata Property Act contains provisions requiring all strata corporations to obtain and maintain liability insurance to insure against this type of occupiers liability. 
(3)George must pay his proportionate share of any judgment registered against the common property of the strata corporation. 
(4)Because George has not owned the units for a minimum of two weeks before the accident occurred, he is not responsible to pay any proportionate amount of the judgment.","Answer: 1 Explanation: Option (1) is correct because a judgment against the strata corporation is a judgment against all the owners, and every strata lot owner is liable to pay the judgment in the portions set out in the Schedule of Unit Entitlement. Option (2) is incorrect because although the Strata Property Act requires the strata corporation to maintain insurance against liability for bodily injury, if this insurance does not cover the full judgment, George would still be liable to pay his proportionate liability. Option (3) is incorrect because the contingency reserve fund is used for paying for common expenses, not for paying damage awards. Option (4) is incorrect because since George is an owner, he must pay his proportionate liability."

(2)The damage caused is trifling. 
(3)David has taken the utmost care and exercised skill in carrying on the activity causing the nuisance. 
(4)David is using his property reasonably.",Answer: 2 Explanation: Option (2) is correct because it is a valid defence to private nuisance if the damage caused is trifling and of little consequence. Option (1) is incorrect because it is no defence to say that the utmost care and skill have been taken.

(1)The easement must be negative in nature. 
(2)The easement must be capable of forming the subject matter of a grant. 
(3)The easement must be negative in nature. 
(4)The easement must accommodate the servient tenement.","Answer: 2 Explanation: Option (2) is correct. The easement must be capable of forming the subject matter of a grant, which means that the easement must be capable of reasonably exact definition. One must be able to identify its boundaries. Furthermore, the person granting the easement and the person whose land receives the benefit of the easement must have the necessary capacity to be grantor and grantee. For example, a tenant cannot grant an easement that binds the property after the tenancy expires. Option (1) is incorrect because an easement can be either positive or negative in nature (in comparison to a restrictive covenant, which must be negative in nature). Option (3) is incorrect because one party can own both the dominant and servient tenement provided that they are two different parcels of land. Option (4) is incorrect because the easement must accommodate the dominant tenement, not the servient tenement."

(3)The second mortgagee can no longer exercise its right to sue the borrower on their personal covenant. 
(4)The petitioner may sell the property after taking title to it and does not have to account to the borrower for any profit that might be realized in excess of the mortgage debt.","Answer: 3 Explanation: Option (3) is correct because an order absolute of foreclosure does not wipe all other charges, liens, encumbrances, and interests off the title. Option (1) is incorrect because once the petitioner has been granted the order absolute of foreclosure, he or she may not then sue the borrower on the borrower’s personal covenant. Option (2) is incorrect because the order absolute of foreclosure declares that the respondents are foreclosed of any right, title, or interest in the mortgaged property and it directs them to deliver up possession of the property to the petitioner. Option (4) is incorrect because if the petitioner sells the land, there is no requirement to account to the borrower for any money received or any profit which might be realized in excess of the mortgaged debt."
"Question 884: With a portable mortgage:

(3)a purchaser takes over responsibility for the remaining contractual terms of an existing mortgage. 
(4)the portable funds fee (PFF) is always charged.","Answer: 2 Explanation: Option (2) is correct because a portable mortgage allows the borrower to sell his or her home and carry the mortgage over to the purchase of a new home. Because of this portability, the borrower will save money if his or her mortgage has a lower interest rate than the current interest rate that a new mortgage would be written at. Option (1) is incorrect because a portable mortgage allows a seller of their home to carry the mortgage over to a purchase of a new home. Option (3) is incorrect because a portable mortgage cannot also be vendor-supplied. Option (4) is incorrect because a portable funds fee is not necessarily always charged on a portable mortgage."

(4)Where an existing building is being converted to either a condominium or a non-profit cooperative, the existing tenants are covered by the protections afforded by the British Columbia Residential Tenancy Act.","Answer: 1 Explanation: Option (1) is correct because buyers of cooperatives own shares in the cooperative association or company and is a tenant, rather than a fee simple owner. Option (2) is incorrect because the disclosure requirements in the Real Estate Development Marketing Act apply to cooperatives and condominiums. Option (3) is incorrect because condominiums are generally easier to sell than cooperatives because the cooperative association’s board of directors must approve the person who proposes to buy a cooperative owner’s shares. Option (4) is incorrect because where a building is being converted to a cooperative, any residential tenants who are required to move will be entitled to the protections of the Residential Tenancy Act."

Option (1) is incorrect because where an existing mortgage will be assumed by the buyer and remain on title, the amount of cash due to the seller is reduced which is reflected as a debit on a seller’s statement of adjustments. Option (3) is incorrect because the seller is responsible for property taxes up to the day before the adjustment date, and the buyer is responsible for the property taxes on the adjustment date. Option (4) is incorrect because a seller’s portion of taxes to be paid in the future will reduce the amount required to complete due from the buyer which is reflected as a credit on a buyer’s statement of adjustments."

(3)$266,630 
(4)$251,560","Answer: 2 Explanation: To calculate the maximum loan amount, calculate the loan amounts based on both the constraint of the loan-to-value ratio and the gross debt service ratio. The loan-to-value is calculated based on the bank’s appraisal of the property. In this case, the amount the bank appraises the property at is $375,000. Once the payments from the GDSR are calculated, the PV of the loan is calculated, taking into consideration the stress test qualification rules. The loan amount that satisfies both constraints (the smaller amount) will be the maximum loan amount. LTV = 80% Lending Value = $375,000 Maximum loan under lender’s LTV criteria = 0.8 × $375,000 = $300,000 GDSR = 32% P + I = (GDSR × Gross Income) – Property Taxes P + I = (0.32 × $60,000) – $1,800 P + I = $17,400 per year = $1,450 per month The mortgage qualifying rate is based on the greater of (1) the government-specified qualifying rate of j2 = 5.25% OR (2) an additional 2% above the mortgage’s negotiated contract rate. In this case, you would apply a rate of j2 = 5.25%, the government-specified rate, which is greater than the mortgage’s contract rate plus 2% of j2 = 5% (2% + 3%).

The maximum that Jake can borrow is the lesser of $300,000 (LTV) and $243,320 (GDSR). In this case, Jake can only borrow $243,320, rounded to the nearest $10."

(4)Licensees are not allowed to wait until an offer is accepted before depositing the deposit cheque in the licensee’s brokerage trust account.","Answer: 1 Explanation: Option (1) is correct because a deposit is not required to create a binding contract of purchase and sale. Option (2) is incorrect because where an offer is received with a deposit after banking hours and the seller rejects the offer before the bank reopens, the cheque may be returned intact to the purchaser. Option (3) is incorrect because agents hold deposits as stakeholders.

(4)All owners listed on title must sign the listing contract.","Answer: 4 Explanation: Option (4) is correct because the listing contract must be signed by all of the owners. Option (1) is incorrect because a listing agreement is a contract between a seller and a brokerage and does not involve a buyer. Option (2) is incorrect because in order for a licensee to be entitled to commission, the licensee must produce a purchaser whose offer strictly complies with the terms of the listing agreement. Option (3) is incorrect because a listing brokerage can still be entitled to commission even if it does not have a listing agreement with the seller prior to listing the property for sale."

(4)To avoid liability under section 52, the person accused of the offence must show that they honestly believed that the representation was not false or misleading and exercised due diligence in making sure that was the case.","Answer: 1 Explanation: Option (1) is correct (false) because the general impression test is used in this situation, which can still result in a conviction under section 52. Option (2) is incorrect (true) because a misrepresentation will only be contrary to section 52 of the Competition Act if it is false or misleading in a material respect. Option (3) is incorrect (true) because section 52 applies to both oral and written misrepresentations.

"Question 933: A prospective buyer signs an offer on a property for $250,000 and mentions to the listing licensee that she would be willing to pay as much as $270,000 for the property if necessary. The listing licensee presents the offer to the seller without mentioning that the buyer may be willing to increase the offer. The seller accepts the offer of $250,000. This fact pattern is: 
(1)an example of the agent’s ethical obligation to deal fairly with the buyer at all times. 
(2)a breach of the agent’s legal and ethical duty of full disclosure to her principal.

Failing to mention that the buyer may be willing to increase the offer is a breach of the agent’s legal and ethical duty of full disclosure. Option (1) is incorrect because the agent does not have an ethical obligation to deal fairly with the buyer at all times. Option (3) is incorrect because this was a breach of the agent’s duty of full disclosure, and therefore is not acceptable conduct. Option (4) is incorrect because this is not an example of the agent’s duty not to make a secret profit."
"Question 934: ABC Loan Co. (“ABC”) has agreed to lend $2 million dollars to Devco Ltd. in exchange for a registered first mortgage against Devco’s current residential construction project. The loan is to be paid out in four equal instalments over a five month period, but all payments are at the discretion of ABC under the “advances” clause in the mortgage. The first instalment has been paid and it is now time to pay out the second instalment. ABC has discovered that a builder’s lien has been filed against Devco’s property. You correctly advise ABC that: 
(1)it is obligated to pay out the second instalment to Devco; to refuse to do so would be a breach of the mortgage contract. 
(2)if the second instalment is advanced to Devco, the lien claimant will have priority over this and any other advances made under the mortgage after the date of registration of the lien. 
(3)it is obligated to pay out the second instalment to Devco; to refuse to do so would be a breach of the mortgage contract. 
(4)None of the above statements is correct.","Answer: 2 Explanation: Option (2) is correct because the Builders Lien Act gives priority to the lien over a mortgage as of the date the lien is filed in the Land Title Office. Where part of the money has been advanced and then a builder’s lien is filed against the property, the builder’s lien has priority over further advances made under the mortgage. Option (1) is incorrect because the advances clause states that all payments are at the discretion of ABC, so it would not be a breach of the mortgage contract to refuse to pay the second installment. Option (3) is incorrect because the lien takes priority over all subsequent advancements of funds because of the operation of the Builders Lien Act. Option (4) is incorrect because allowing a builder’s lien to remain on title does not constitute a breach of the mortgage contract."

"Question 939: A clerk in the land title office mistakenly registered a fee simple transfer on the wrong title, with the result that Lot 5, owned by Michael, was transferred to Scott. Scott discovered this error and, instead of correcting the error, he sold the property to another person who was unaware of the clerical error and of Scott’s dishonest conduct. Michael discovered the error after the buyer had registered the transfer from Scott. He wants his land restored to him and the register corrected. You correctly advise Michael that: 
(1)because this situation was caused by a clerical error, the Registrar will correct the register and restore Michael’s property to him. 
(2)the person who bought the property, bona fide and for value, from Scott, is protected by the British Columbia land title system; as a result, Michael cannot have his property restored to him. 
(3)because this situation was caused by a clerical error, the Registrar will correct the register and restore Michael’s property to him. 
(4)because Scott acted fraudulently, the transfer of the property to the third party is a void deed, meaning that Michael can have the property restored to him.","Answer: 2 Explanation: Option (2) is correct because the indefeasibility principle means that any registered owner who acquires a fee simple estate in good faith and for valuable consideration is protected by the land title system. That purchaser can keep his or her title, even if the previous registered owner acquired title by way of fraud or forgery. Option (1) is incorrect because the indefeasibility principle allows the purchaser to keep his or her title. Option (3) is incorrect because Michael did not contribute to his own loss by neglecting to register a lien on his title to indicate that he was the registered owner. Option (4) is incorrect because the principle of indefeasibility overrules the common law doctrine of void deed, and so the transfer of the property to the third party was valid and the purchaser now has indefeasibility of title."

(3)A unanimous vote of 100% of the members of a strata corporation is usually required to approve an amendment to the bylaws of the corporation. 
(4)Before a strata plan can be registered in the land title office, all of the strata lots must be presold.","Answer: 2 Explanation: Option (2) is correct because the registration and approval of a strata plan creates an estate in fee simple for each individual strata lot. Option (1) is incorrect because the approval required to amend the bylaws of the corporation varies based on the strata type, and whether it is before or after the second annual general meeting. Option (3) is incorrect because the condominium concept can be utilized for both residential and non-residential projects. Option (4) is incorrect because all strata lots do not need to be presold before a strata plan can be registered in the land title office."

(4)The brokerage appoints one or more specific licensees to act as the seller’s sole agent.","Answer: 4 Explanation: Option (4) is the correct answer because under designated agency, while the contracting party is still the brokerage, the seller agrees that the brokerage will appoint one or more specific licensees to act as the seller’s sole agent.

"Question 945: Fletcher owns Lot 1, a rock-strewn beachfront property to which he had added 1 tonne of white sand imported from Aruba. Ana, owner of Lot 2, is Fletcher’s neighbour. Lot 2 has a tennis court located near the beach. On windy days, the fine white sand on Fletcher’s property is carried by the wind onto Ana’s property, where it coats the clay surface of the tennis court, making it very slippery and hazardous for anyone playing there.

(2)This is likely an example of the tort of private nuisance. 
(3)This is likely an example of the tort of trespass. 
(4)Fletcher may successfully defend against a lawsuit brought by Ana on the basis that the damage caused is unintentional.","Answer: 2 Explanation: Option (2) is correct because the sand blowing onto Ana’s property, making the tennis court slippery and hazardous for anyone playing there, is likely to be considered an unreasonable and substantial interference with the reasonable use and enjoyment of her property, and would therefore be considered a private nuisance. Option (1) is incorrect because trespass requires an intentional act, and the sand was carried onto Ana’s property by the wind, rather than by an intentional act done by Fletcher. Option (3) is incorrect because Fletcher could still be liable for private nuisance even though the problem occurred because of the wind. Option (4) is incorrect because the tort of private nuisance does not require the conduct to be done intentionally."

(2)$340,355.45 
(3)$306,807.62 
(4)$313,467.23","Answer: 1 Explanation: Since we know that the comparable property has one less bedroom, its sale price calls for an adjustment. We know that the market value of one bedroom is $1,100, so the sale price of the subject property is adjusted up by $1,100. We also know that the comparable property has a garage, while the subject does not. Since the market value of a garage is stated to be $7,000, we must adjust the sale price of the comparable down by $7,000. Finally, it is stated that each 100 sq. ft. above the 2,000 sq. ft. benchmark has a market value of $3,000. Since the comparable is 200 sq. ft. smaller than the subject, we must adjust the sale price of the comparable up by 200 sq. ft. × $3,000 = $6,000. The adjusted sale price is $173,000 +$1,100  $7,000 + $6,000 = $173,100"

(2)The owner lives abroad, but he rents the property for six 30-day terms throughout the year in order to avoid paying the Empty Homes Tax. 
(3)The owner spends the summer (from June to August) living in the property as a principal residence. For the remainder of the year, she lists the property on Airbnb, exclusively for weekend trips. She does not have a hotel or Band;B licence. 
(4)The owners initially purchased the property as an investment, but now that their daughter has started attending university in Vancouver, she uses the property as a principal residence from September to April of the same year.","Answer: 1 Explanation: Option (1) is correct because the owner would have to live in the property as a principal residence for 6 months in order to avoid the Empty Homes Tax; 3 months is not sufficient. In addition, investors who use their property as a short term rental without a hotel or B&B license are subject to the EHT where the rental periods are shorter than 30 days. Option (2) is incorrect because properties which are rented for at least 30 days in a row for a minimum of six months in aggregate over the course of a year are exempt from the EHT. Options (3) and (4) are incorrect because the EHT does not apply to properties being used as a principal residence by the owner, a family member, or a friend for at least six months of the year."

(3)The registration of a mortgage in the land title office is conclusive evidence that the mortgagee is entitled to an interest in the land described in the mortgage document.

(1)Natural features, such as trees and streams 
(2)Moveable objects such as furniture

The Assessment Act is one of the sources of property law, but not the only source. Option (2) is incorrect (true) since Helen, as the registered owner, is no longer living in the Vancouver property, she is not eligible for the basic home owner grant. Option (3) is incorrect (true); if a property has been incorrectly assessed, anyone, including a municipal council, can file an appeal to the Property Assessment Review Panels under the Assessment Act.

(3)The interests of the agent take priority over those of the principal. 
(4)None of the above statements are true.","Answer: 4 Explanation: Option (4) is correct because none of the other statements are true. Option (1) is incorrect because the interests of the agent do not take priority over those of the principal.

(2)The mortgage is not payable until a time more than five years from the date of the mortgage.

(1)The landlord may immediately enter the leased premises and seize the tenant’s furniture of sufficient value to equal the amount of rent owing. 
(2)The landlord is prohibited by law from terminating this fixed term lease; it must continue until its expiry date. The landlord’s only remedy is to take the matter to arbitration. 
(3)The landlord may immediately enter the leased premises and seize the tenant’s furniture of sufficient value to equal the amount of rent owing. 
(4)The agreement is now void because of the tenant’s breach of one its fundamental covenants, i.e., the requirement to pay rent.","Answer: 3 Explanation: Option (3) is correct because section 46 of the Residential Tenancy Act provides that a landlord can give a notice of the end of the tenancy agreement to a tenant who does not pay the rent when it is due, which is cancelled if the tenant pays the rent owing within 5 days of receiving the notice. Option (1) is incorrect because section 26 of the Residential Tenancy Act abolishes the remedy of distress (seizing a tenant’s goods and eventually selling them to satisfy a claim for rent owing) in residential tenancies.

(4)A tenant who occupies land under a 20 year lease can grant an easement to a neighbouring property owner and the easement, if registered in the land title office, will run with the land even after the lease expires.","Answer: 3 Explanation: Option (3) is correct because an implied easement may result if the intention of the parties granting the easement has not been sufficiently explicit. Option (1) is incorrect because the land receiving the benefit is called the dominant tenement. Option (2) is incorrect because the dominant tenement owner does not receive an ownership of the easement area, but rather has an interest in the land less than ownership.

"Question 973: Joan was considering putting in an offer on a farm in Peachland, British Columbia for $130,000, subject to arranging suitable financing. She approached Peachy Credit Union for pre-approval of a mortgage loan, and Peachy hired A and; A Appraisers to determine the value of the farm for mortgage purposes. A and; A appraised the property at $135,000 and Peachy Credit Union approved a mortgage loan of $101,250 to Joan, who then went ahead with the purchase. Eleven months later the bank was forced to foreclose on the property and upon obtaining another appraisal, found that the market value of the property was only $70,000. It is found that A and; A was negligent in its appraisal report. What remedies, if any, are available to Joan and Peachy Credit Union? 
(1)Peachy Credit Union can sue A and; A for breach of contract, but Joan has no case against A and; A.

(2)The amount of a security deposit may be freely negotiated between the two parties to a commercial lease. 
(3)The interest that accrues on a security deposit is always paid to the account of the landlord. 
(4)Security deposits must not exceed 150% of the monthly rent as a higher amount is unconscionable and therefore illegal.","Answer: 2 Explanation: Option (2) is correct because there are no legal restrictions regarding security deposits, so this is an item left open for negotiation. Option (1) is incorrect because it is up for negotiation who is entitled to the interest which accrues on a security deposit.

(4)A licensee is not required to provide opinions to buyers on areas outside their expertise; rather, it is the buyer’s responsibility to seek the opinion of a qualified expert.",Answer: 4 Explanation: Option (4) is correct because licensees are not required to provide opinions to buyers on areas outside of their expertise. Option (1) is incorrect because a disclosure statement will not protect licensees from all misrepresentations. Option (2) is incorrect because a licensee can be liable for the tort of fraudulent misrepresentation even if he or she does not have expertise in that area.

Option (1) is incorrect because as an agent, the listing licensee owes a duty to follow his or her principal’s instructions. The listing licensee must therefore discontinue acting for the principal, rather than disregard the principal’s instructions. Option (2) is incorrect because the British Columbia Financial Services Authority governs licensees’ conduct; it does not govern consumers’ conduct.

"Question 977: A mortgage broker has helped you set up a mortgage loan. The loan is for $250,000 at an interest rate of j12 = 4.5% and a 20-year amortization. The loan calls for monthly payments of $1,582 over a 3-year term with $225,208.61 owing at the end of 3 years. If the lender pays the broker a fee of 2% of the funds advanced, what is the yield to the lender, expressed as an effective annual rate (j1)? 
(1)4.485244% 
(2)3.228752%

Therefore, the lender is being slightly underpaid with each payment. Given the inverse relationship between interest rates and present value, if the present value rises, then the interest rate drops."

Tom, now suffering from buyer’s remorse, is unhappy with the arrangement, and has reported Tina to the British Columbia Financial Services Authority (BCFSA) Which of the following statements is/are TRUE? 
(1)Tina did nothing wrong in making this promise because she provided all the terms of the promise in writing, to Tom, prior to his entering the contract of purchase and sale.

(4)Both (2) and (3) are true.","Answer: 1 Explanation: Option (1) is correct because although section 49 of the Real Estate Services Rules places limitations on when licensees can make promises to purchase property to induce a buyer to enter a contract, Tina complied with these limitations because she provided all the terms of the promise in writing to Tom before he entered into the contract of purchase and sale. Option (2) is incorrect because Tina did not breach the Real Estate Services Act.

"Question 980: Andrew forged a mortgage and registered it against the fee simple title of Julia, without her knowledge.

Julia told Handy Dandy that she had never granted a mortgage to anyone, and that she had no intention of paying them anything. Andrew is now living happily in Bolivia.

(1)Handy Dandy’s mortgage is protected under the Land Title Act, since they dealt with the registered holder of the mortgage, and relied on the register. 
(2)Julia will be obliged to repay the mortgage to Handy Dandy, but she will be entitled to recover that amount from the assurance fund. 
(3)Handy Dandy’s mortgage is protected under the Land Title Act, since they dealt with the registered holder of the mortgage, and relied on the register. 
(4)Julia will be able to have Handy Dandy’s mortgage removed from her title, and Handy Dandy will have no recourse, except against Andrew.","Answer: 4 Explanation: Option (4) is correct because registered charges are not indefeasible, but rather only raise a rebuttable presumption that the charge is valid. An innocent purchaser of any interest less than a fee simple estate in land may not rely on the land title system as being conclusive proof of ownership. Option (1) is incorrect because registered charges are not indefeasible. Option (2) is incorrect because Julia is able to have the mortgage removed from her title, and so is not obliged to repay the mortgage or recover from the assurance fund.

(2)Real property is immobile. 
(3)The supply of urban land is not fixed.

The residents of Vancouver are lobbying the city council to close down the plant. Which of the following statements is TRUE? 
(1)The plant is a legal non-conforming use of the land that may continue indefinitely. 
(2)The plant is a legal non-conforming use of the land that may continue until Jake sells the property. 
(3)The plant is a legal non-conforming use of the land that may continue indefinitely. 
(4)If Jake wants to sell the plant, most buyers will require him to take steps to make the use a legal one by obtaining a bylaw amendment called a land use contract for the site.","Answer: 1 Explanation: Option (1) is correct because the plant was conforming to the bylaw prior to the rezoning, and so it will be “grandfathered” as a legal non-conforming use. Option (2) is incorrect because a non-conforming use may continue through successive changes of ownership. Option (3) is incorrect because the Local Government Act, not the Planning Act, establishes the circumstances under which non-conforming uses may continue. Option (4) is incorrect because land use contracts can no longer be created; rather, the use could continue as a legal non-conforming use or the property owner could apply to have the area rezoned."
"Question 990: Eugene and Lenore visited Green Maple Tree Farms. The property is owned and operated by Rodney. Trees kept for sale are placed in holes in the ground, with their roots encased in burlap. The holes are not filled in when a tree is removed, but are located in a grid pattern, which is apparent to any viewer. Signs are located at the beginning and end of every row of trees warning customers to watch for and avoid open holes. Eugene and Lenore walked among the rows of trees while selecting a tree for their purchase. Eugene and Lenore noticed an open hole (approximately 3 feet in diameter). Lenore walked around the hole and Eugene attempted to step across the hole. Eugene fell into the hole and fractured his leg. Shortly after this event, Lenore tripped over a green garden hose lying unseen in the grass between the rows of trees, which was left by Rodney earlier in the day. Lenore broke her arm in her fall. Which of the following statements is TRUE? 
(1)Rodney is liable to both Eugene and Lenore for their injuries suffered as a result of his breach of the duty of care owed to them under the Occupiers Liability Act. 
(2)Rodney can successfully defend against a lawsuit by both Eugene and Lenore, using the defence contained in the Occupiers Liability Act that an occupier has no duty of care to a person in respect of risks willingly accepted by that person as their own risks. 
(3)Rodney is liable to both Eugene and Lenore for their injuries suffered as a result of his breach of the duty of care owed to them under the Occupiers Liability Act. 
(4)Rodney will not be liable for either Eugene or Lenore’s injuries if he was not at Green Maple Tree Farms at the time that the injuries occurred.","Answer: 3 Explanation: Option (3) is correct because occupiers are entitled to assume that a visitor will exercise reasonable care for their own safety. Because Eugene breached this duty, he will probably not recover any damages against Rodney. Option (1) is incorrect because Rodney is likely not liable to Eugene for his injuries. Option (2) is incorrect because Lenore’s injury from tripping on the garden hose was a direct result of Rodney’s negligence, and she did not willingly assume these risks, so Rodney will likely be liable for her injuries. Option (4) is incorrect because Rodney is still an occupier of the premises even if he is not physically present when the injuries in question occurred."
"Question 991: Ethan visited a used car lot, owned and operated by Clara. The lot contains a variety of used cars, in addition to a marked off area where Clara keeps a variety of car parts. There are large signs around the marked off area, warning customers not to enter the area without the presence of an employee. Ethan, while walking around the lot, noticed a set of vintage car wheels in the marked off area. Disregarding the signage, Ethan entered the area to get a closer look at the wheels. Unfortunately, Ethan stepped on a small engine part that was lying on the ground and slipped and broke his ankle. Which of the following statements is TRUE? 
(1)If Ethan had been trespassing on Clara’s lot, Ethan would have been owed no duty of care whatsoever under the Occupiers Liability Act. 
(2)If Ethan was an infant, he would likely be owed a higher duty of care than an adult because of an infant’s relative inability to appreciate the danger presented by marked off areas in a used car lot. 
(3)If Ethan had been trespassing on Clara’s lot, Ethan would have been owed no duty of care whatsoever under the Occupiers Liability Act. 
(4)If Clara had an employee supervise the lot, and Clara was away from the lot at the time of the injury, only the employee can be held liable under the Occupiers Liability Act.","Answer: 2 Explanation: Option (2) is correct because the Occupiers Liability Act requires an occupier of premises to take care that is reasonable in all of the circumstances to ensure that a person will be reasonably safe in using the premises. If Ethan was a child, it is likely that it would be found reasonable that he could not have read the sign, and so the occupier would have been required to do more to ensure he was reasonably safe. Option (1) is incorrect, because a visitor is deemed to have willingly assumed all risks only if trespassing while also committing or having the intention to commit a criminal act. Even if a person has willingly assumed all risks, an occupier still has a duty not to create a danger with intent to do harm to the person, or act with reckless disregard to the safety of the person. Option (3) is incorrect because the Occupiers Liability Act provides that an occupier is liable, and if Clara was leasing the lot, she could still be an occupier under the Act if she was in physical possession of the premises, or had responsibility for, and control over, the condition of the premises, the activities conducted on those premises, and the persons allowed to enter those premises. Option (4) is incorrect because as long as Clara is deemed an occupier under the Act, then she would be liable even if she was away from the lot at the time of the injury."
"Question 992: A new furnace that Sally installed in her house exploded six months after installation. Sally intends to bring a lawsuit against the manufacturer. What is the first document that Sally’s lawyer will file? 
(1)A response to civil claim 
(2)A notice of trial 
(3)A response to civil claim 
(4)A garnishing order","Answer: 3 Explanation: Option (3) is correct and Options (1), (2), and (4) are incorrect because filing a notice of civil claim is the first step to in bringing a claim."
"Question 993: Which of the following appears in the “Description of Land” section of a Land Title Search in British Columbia? 
(1)Civic street address of the property 
(2)Parcel identifier, or PID 
(3)Civic street address of the property 
(4)Geodetic coordinates for each corner of the property","Answer: 2 Explanation: Option (2) is correct because the parcel identifier (PID) is listed under the “Description of Land” section of a title search. Options (1), (3) and (4) are incorrect because these items are not listed on a title search."
"Question 994: Which of the following results from the immobility of land? 
(1)A large older home is divided into four separate suites, and each is sold as a unit. 
(2)A piece of land is zoned as parkland, thereby increasing the value of nearby homes. 
(3)A large older home is divided into four separate suites, and each is sold as a unit. 
(4)The economic life of a building may be shorter than its physical life.","Answer: 2 Explanation: Option (2) is correct because the immobile nature of land causes real property to be more influenced by externalities. Options (1), (3), and (4) are incorrect as they do not describe externalities resulting from land’s immobility."
"Question 995: A company pays $97,635 for an asset on which the Income Tax Act allows capital cost allowance at 5% per year. The asset is expected to have a useful life of 25 years and will have no salvage value at the end of this time. Calculate the depreciation expense for accounting purposes for the asset’s third year if the accountant chooses to use straight-line depreciation. 
(1)$3,913.40 
(2)$4,185.49 
(3)$3,913.40 
(4)$3,905.40","Answer: 4 Explanation: In this question, straight-line means that each year the expense will be the same. We ignore CCA."
"Question 996: Which of the following statements about fixtures and chattels is FALSE? 
(1)When a chattel becomes attached, even slightly, to real property, it is presumed to be considered a fixture unless circumstances show that the item was intended to remain a chattel. 
(2)A seller of real property has the right to detach and remove any fixture after entering the contract of purchase and sale, if they so desire. 
(3)When a chattel becomes attached, even slightly, to real property, it is presumed to be considered a fixture unless circumstances show that the item was intended to remain a chattel. 
(4)If an object cannot be removed without damaging the real property, this is an indication that the object is a fixture.","Answer: 2 Explanation: Option (2) is correct because items that are fixtures are considered part of the land and will belong to the buyer upon completion. Therefore, a seller of real property does not have the right to detach and remove any fixture after entering the contract of purchase and sale. Option (1) is incorrect because an object “prima facie” is considered a fixture once it is even slightly attached to real property, unless it is shown that it was intended to remain a chattel. Option (3) is incorrect because if an object is attached to the real property for the better use of the mirror, the owner will usually be entitled to remove the object (as it is considered a chattel) when the house is sold. Option (4) is incorrect because if an object cannot be removed without damaging the real property, then this is an indication that it is likely to be considered a fixture."
"Question 997: Which one of the following is NOT a reason why an investor would use borrowed funds instead of an all cash offer for a real estate investment? 
(1)To diversify investments and reduce overall risk 
(2)To get a regular and predictable return on capital 
(3)To diversify investments and reduce overall risk 
(4)Lack of adequate capital to make the desired investment","Answer: 2 Explanation: Option (2) is correct. Choosing debt financing instead of equity financing will not change the predictability of return on capital. Options (1), (3), and (4) are incorrect because they are valid reasons to choose debt financing over equity financing."
"Question 998: Which of the following is a common law source of duties to clients? 
(1)The Real Estate Services Act 
(2)The Real Estate Services Regulation 
(3)The Real Estate Services Act 
(4)The Real Estate Services Rules","Answer: 3 Explanation: Option (3) is correct because agency/fiduciary law is an example of a common law source of duties to clients. Options (1), (2), and (4) are incorrect because they are examples of legislative duties to clients."
"Question 999: Mimi was house-sitting for her friends Tom and Lizzie while they were on a three month photo-safari in Africa. The front porch was damaged in a freak storm that caused a tree to fall and smash the bottom two steps. Mimi didn’t have the money to hire a carpenter to repair the stairs, so she attached a large sign to the bottom of the steps reading, “DANGER KEEP OFF”. Dave, an out of work handyman who could not read English, was walking from house to house in the neighbourhood looking for casual work. He entered Tom and Lizzie’s property, and not understanding the sign started up the steps to the front door. Dave landed on the damaged step, and the weight of his body was more than the step could stand. He broke his leg in two places, and having no insurance, has run up $3,750 in medical bills. Dave now intends to begin a lawsuit. Which of the following statements is FALSE? 
(1)Under the Occupiers Liability Act, both Mimi and the absent owners qualify as “occupiers.” 
(2)Dave will be unsuccessful in his lawsuit because he willingly accepted the risk of injury when he walked up the broken steps. 
(3)Under the Occupiers Liability Act, both Mimi and the absent owners qualify as “occupiers.” 
(4)A court will consider the reasonableness of the occupier’s actions in order to establish liability in this case.","Answer: 2 Explanation: Option (2) is correct because Dave is not trespassing while committing or intending to commit a criminal act (as he was merely looking for casual work). Dave also does not fall under any of the other enumerated categories of visitors who are deemed to have willingly assumed all the risks of entering on a property under section 3 of the Occupiers Liability Act. Option (1) is incorrect because Mimi is an occupier since she is in “physical possession of the premises”, and the absent owners remain occupiers because they still have “responsibility for, and control over” the property. (There may be more than one occupier of the same premises as per section 1 of the Occupiers Liability Act.) Option (3) is incorrect because section 3(2) of the Occupiers Liability Act states that the duty of care imposed on occupiers applies in relation to the: (a) condition of the premises; (b) activities on the premises; or (c) conduct of third parties on the premises. Option (4) is incorrect because the duty of care imposed by the Occupiers Liability Act on an occupier is to take such care as in all the circumstances is reasonable to see that persons coming onto the property will be reasonably safe."
