"Question 1: Latent defects are defects that are unknown to the buyer and that are: 
(1)immediately visible to the eye of the average person. 
(2)required to be disclosed by the buyer to the seller. 
(3)the responsibility of the licensee to discover. 
(4)not discoverable upon a reasonable inspection of the property.",Answer: 4 Explanation: Option (4) is correct because a latent defect is a defect which is not immediately discoverable upon a reasonable inspection of the property. Option (1) is incorrect because a defect immediately visible to the eye is a patent defect. Option (2) is incorrect because a latent defect is required to be disclosed by the seller not the buyer. Option (3) is incorrect because a latent defect is the responsibility of the seller to disclose.
"Question 2: Real property is said to be more subject to the effects of externalities than most assets. This vulnerability is principally due to: 
(1)the relatively high cost of real property. 
(2)the fact that land is fixed in supply. 
(3)the immobility of land. 
(4)the lack of effective government regulations.","Answer: 3 Explanation: Option (3) is correct because the immobility of land renders real property more subject real property to the effects of externalities than most assets. An owner cannot move his or her real property to a more desirable location with beneficial externalities. Similarly, an owner cannot move his or her property away from a location subject or negative externalities. This characteristic of land has the greatest effect on the value of a real property asset. Options (1), (2), and (4) are therefore incorrect."
"Question 3: Which of the following is NOT a “real estate service” under the Real Estate Services Act? 
(1)Constructing a commercial office building in Prince George for an owner who lives in British Columbia 
(2)Collecting rents from tenants in a residential building in Burnaby for an owner who lives in Singapore 
(3)Selling a Penticton property for an owner who lives in Victoria 
(4)Assisting in the sale of a condominium unit located in Vancouver but owned by a person who lives in Calgary",Answer: 1 Explanation: Option (1) is correct because construction of a building is not a real estate service under the Real Estate Services Act. Option (2) is incorrect because collecting rents from tenants is defined as “rental property management services” which fall under “real estate services” in the Real Estate Services Act. Options (3) and (4) are incorrect because selling or assisting in the sale of properties is defined as “trading services” which fall under “real estate services” in the Real Estate Services Act.
"Question 4: Which of the following statements is TRUE regarding sole proprietorships, partnerships, and corporations? 
(1)Only sole proprietors need to report business income on their personal income tax returns. 
(2)Only partners of a partnership need to report business income on their personal tax returns. 
(3)Sole proprietorships, partnerships, and corporations are identical in terms of taxation of owner's income. 
(4)A corporation is a separate legal entity with its own income tax status.",Answer: 4 Explanation: Option (4) is correct; corporations are subject to income tax as a separate legal entity. Options (1) and (2) are incorrect because both sole proprietors and partners need to report their business income on their personal income tax returns. Option (3) is incorrect because corporations have different tax liability from proprietors and partners in that corporations are taxed as a separate legal entity.
"Question 5: Consider a situation in which the principal is the seller and the agent is the listing agent. Which of the following events will terminate the real estate agency relationship? 
(1)The principal’s refusal to accept an offer to purchase presented by the agent where the offer exactly complies with the requirements in the listing contract 
(2)An act of the principal that is inconsistent with the continuation of the agent’s authority 
(3)An offer by the agent to personally purchase the principal’s property 
(4)The revocation of an offer to purchase by the offeror before the principal can accept it","Answer: 2 Explanation: Option (2) is correct because a real estate agency relationship depends on mutual consent, and therefore either party can terminate the relationship at will. An agent’s authority can be revoked orally or by conduct, and an act of the principal that is inconsistent with the continuation of authority terminates the relationship. Options (1) and (4) are incorrect because these scenarios do not terminate the agency relationship. They relate to the principal’s duty to pay real estate commission to the agent. Option (3) is incorrect because an agent’s offer to personally purchase the principal’s property is a conflict of interest. While such conflicts should be avoided, they do not terminate the agency relationship."
"Question 6: A $170,000 mortgage loan, written at a nominal rate of 7% per annum, compounded annually, has a 2-year contractual term. Payments are made monthly and are based on a 20-year amortization period. Payments are rounded to the next higher dollar. What is the size of the required payments? 
(1)$1,307 
(2)$1,319

"Question 7: Before adopting, amending, or repealing a zoning bylaw, a municipal council as a matter of policy will: 
(1)obtain the approval of the federal government. 
(2)obtain the approval of the provincial government. 
(3)give three months’ written notice to the public. 
(4)hold a public hearing.","Answer: 4 Explanation: Option (4) is correct because a municipal council will hold a public hearing before adopting, amending or repealing a bylaw. Options (1) and (2) are incorrect because the power to zone has been delegated to the municipality by the Province, and the Province has not retained the right to decide zoning matters. Option (3) is incorrect because a municipal council typically issues notice of a public hearing to neighbouring properties, but no specified written notice is required."
"Question 8: Which of the following might be the subject of a real property appraisal? 
(1)Air space rights 
(2)A life insurance policy 
(3)A diamond 
(4)A home owner’s insurance policy","Answer: 1 Explanation: Option (1) is correct because the subject of a real property appraisal is the particular rights of ownership vested in a certain piece of real estate. Air space rights are a legal interest in real property. Options (2), (3), and (4) are incorrect because these do not describe legal interests in real property."
"Question 9: When commencing a lawsuit in small claims court, the plaintiff may originate the action in which of the following jurisdictions? 
(1)Where either the plaintiff resides or the defendant resides 
(2)Where the plaintiff resides only 
(3)Where either the cause of action arose or the defendant resides 
(4)Where either the cause of action arose or the plaintiff resides","Answer: 3 Explanation: Option (3) is correct because the plaintiff may originate an action either in the jurisdiction where the circumstances giving rise to the claim arose, or in the jurisdiction where the defendant resides or carries on business. Options (1), (2), and (4) are incorrect for this reason."
"Question 10: The principle that the person named on a particular certificate of title is entitled to a fee simple interest in that property, free from any condition or encumbrance that is not shown on title, is known as the: 
(1)assurance principle. 
(2)entitlement principle. 
(3)fee simple principle. 
(4)indefeasibility principle.","Answer: 4 Explanation: Option (4) is correct and (1), (2), and (3) are incorrect because the principle of indefeasibility means that if a person is named on a certificate of title as the owner of the fee simple estate in land, then that is conclusive proof, as far as the world is concerned, that he or she is entitled to that fee simple estate."
"Question 11: In the event that the tenant abandons a commercial premises, the landlord is best advised to notify the tenant that the landlord intends to enter into possession of the premises solely to re-let on the tenant’s account: 
(1)or else the doctrine of frustration will be applied to the situation. 
(2)to avoid the tenant having grounds for an action in trespass. 
(3)so that all of the landlord’s rights against the tenant will be preserved. 
(4)because otherwise the landlord will be breaching the covenant of quiet enjoyment.","Answer: 3 Explanation: Option (3) is correct because if the landlord notifies the tenant of entry to re-let the premises, he will not lose his rights against the tenant. Option (1) is incorrect because the doctrine of frustration only applies when events outside of the control of the parties fundamentally change the subject matter of the contract. In this case, an abandonment of commercial premises would not frustrate the contract. Option (2) is incorrect because even if the landlord did not provide notice, the tenant would not have grounds for an action in trespass, as the landlord has a right to enter incidental to the right to levy a distress. Option (4) is incorrect because the covenant of quiet enjoyment protects the tenant’s right to the premises. Here, the tenant has abandoned the premises and the landlord would not be breaching the covenant by entering the premises."
"Question 12: Which of the following elements are NOT considered in determining appropriate rates of interest on mortgage loans? 
(1)The credit rating of the borrower 
(2)The type of property used for security 
(3)The amount of administrative attention required on the loan 
(4)The amount of property insurance","Answer: 4 Explanation: Option (4) is correct because the amount of property insurance does not affect the risk to the lender, and therefore will not be considered in determining the appropriate rate. Options (1) and (2) are incorrect because the borrower’s credit rating and the type of property affect the risk of the loan to the lender. Option (3) is incorrect because a lender will set an appropriate rate of return based on the risk of lending, as well as the amount of administrative work required."
"Question 13: Where a commercial tenancy is expressed as lasting for a period of one year and terminating on a fixed date, how much notice must be given to terminate the tenancy? 
(1)No notice is required. 
(2)Thirty days’ notice is required. 
(3)Six months’ notice is required. 
(4)Reasonable notice is required.","Answer: 1 Explanation: Option (1) is correct because a commercial lease for a fixed term terminates at the end of the term, on the specified end date. Options (2), (3), and (4) are incorrect for this reason."
"Question 14: Which of the following is NOT a possible meaning of the term “common law”? 
(1)The law created by the courts as opposed to statute law 
(2)The principles derived from the common law courts in England as opposed to the principles derived from the courts of Chancery 
(3)The laws created by the Federal government in accordance with its power under the Constitution 
(4)The system of law which relies upon the principle of stare decisis for its development","Answer: 3 Explanation: Option (3) is the correct answer because it is not a possible meaning of the term “common law”. The body of laws created by the Federal government (i.e., by the federal legislature) is referred to as statute law. Option (1) is incorrect because the term “common law” often broadly refers to the law created by the courts, based in either common-law or equitable principles. Option (2) is incorrect because another possible meaning of “common law” is the original set of court-developed principles, which evolved separately from equitable principles, before these two courts merged. Option (4) is incorrect because the doctrine of stare decisis underlies the binding nature of precedent within the common law."
"Question 15: On May 3, Mary offered to buy Harvey’s house, and the offer was stated to be open for acceptance until 2:00 p.m. May 4. Which one of the following statements is FALSE? 
(1)Mary can revoke her offer prior to 2:00 p.m. on May 4. 
(2)Mary’s offer represents an option agreement. 
(3)If Harvey makes any changes to the offer, Mary’s original offer is terminated. 
(4)If Mary mails a notice of revocation to Harvey, the offer is only revoked if the notice is received by Harvey before he accepts.","Answer: 2 Explanation: Option (2) is the correct answer because it is false. Separate consideration needs to be given to create an option agreement and keep the offer open. Option (1) is incorrect because it is true – revocation of an offer can happen at any time prior to the expiration of the offer. Option (3) is incorrect because any changes that Harvey makes to the offer would be considered a counter-offer. A counter-offer must be accepted by Mary, so it effectively terminates her original offer. Option (4) is incorrect because revocation must actually be communicated to Harvey. There is no “postal acceptance rule” with regards to revocation."
"Question 16: Mike bought a house two years ago at which time he arranged a $110,000 mortgage. This loan was written at a nominal rate of 9.5% per annum, compounded semi-annually, with a 10-year term and amortization period, and monthly payments of $1,413. Today Mike has received an offer from Andre to buy his house for $50,000 cash plus assumption of his mortgage. If current mortgage rates for similar mortgages are 12% per annum, compounded semi-annually, what is the market value of Andre’s offer, rounded to the nearest dollar? 
(1)$127,146 
(2)$137,795 
(3)$90,312 
(4)$89,792","Answer: 2 Explanation: Find the new PV, given that the payments remain at $1,413, but the market value of the mortgage changes because the new rates are 12% per annum, compounded semi-annually. This rate is higher than the contract rate; therefore, we would expect the PV of the loan to be lower. Also, we only have 8 years, or 96 N, left on the mortgage.

"Question 17: Which of the following contractual clauses in a mortgage could apply where the mortgage is otherwise in good standing but the borrower has not paid their property taxes? 
(1)A “further charges” clause 
(2)A “repayment” clause 
(3)An “acceleration” clause 
(4)An “omnibus” clause","Answer: 4 Explanation: Option (4) is correct because an omnibus clause allows the mortgagee to pay monies to be paid by the mortgagor (e.g., property taxes or strata charges) if unpaid and such amounts are added to the principal secured. Options (1), (2), and (3) are incorrect as these clauses are not applicable in such a situation."
"Question 18: Which of the following items is NOT an example of a technological compatibility issue? 
(1)A licensee cannot access a forms software because it is not compatible with her computer’s operating system. 
(2)A licensee sends a form to a property seller from a mobile phone, and the seller is able to fill it out from her desktop computer. 
(3)A prospective client can view a licensee’s website from his laptop, but the website is difficult to navigate from his smartphone. 
(4)A licensee has to enter the same property information into three different programs because the programs are not compatible with one another.","Answer: 2 Explanation: Option (2) is the correct answer because the form is compatible across mobile devices, therefore it is not an example of a technological capability issue. Options (1), (3), and (4) are all examples of technological compatibility issues and are therefore incorrect."
"Question 19: A developer is selling a development unit of subdivided land situated in British Columbia and the developer has obtained a written statement from the purchaser acknowledging that the buyer has read the appropriate disclosure statement. If the purchase agreement is then entered into, the buyer: 
(1)may serve notice to rescind the contract no later than three days from the date of the contract. 
(2)may serve notice to rescind the contract no later than seven days from the date of the contract. 
(3)may serve notice to rescind the contract no later than one year from the date of the contract. 
(4)may not rescind the contract.","Answer: 2 Explanation: Option (2) is correct because there is a seven day rescission right whereby the purchaser can serve written notice of rescission seven days after giving a written statement that they have read the disclosure statement. Options (1), (3), and (4) are incorrect for this reason."
"Question 20: Which of the following statements is TRUE? 
(1)Real estate appraisers must be licensed in British Columbia. 
(2)With an unusual property or a market with few participants, the margin of error in an appraiser’s estimate of market value is always 5% or lower. 
(3)A licensed real estate representative cannot give an appraisal of real property. 
(4)The market value of real property as determined by an experienced appraiser may be greater than the ceiling price of the buyer.","Answer: 4 Explanation: Option (4) is true because the ceiling price of a buyer is subjective and could be any value; for example, far above the appraised value. Option (1) is incorrect as there are no licensing requirements for real estate appraisers. Option (2) is incorrect because the recognized margin of error for an appraisal of an usual property or a market with few participants will likely be much higher than 5% to 10%. Option (3) is incorrect as there is no legal requirement for a specific appraisal license or designation that would prevent a qualified licensed real estate representative from performing an appraisal."
"Question 21: Alan is Peter’s agent with the express authority to rent Peter’s cottage for the summer months. However, in his capacity as Peter’s agent, Alan accepts an offer to purchase the cottage instead. When Peter discovers the incident, he is so impressed by the price, he calls and tells the buyers that he adopts Alan’s act. Which of the following is the result of these actions at law? 
(1)Peter has ratified Alan’s actions, therefore the buyers cannot sue Alan for breach of warranty of authority. 
(2)When Peter adopted Alan’s act, he created legal authority by means of revocation. 
(3)Peter did not need to adopt Alan’s act because Alan had apparent authority. 
(4)None of the above","Answer: 1 Explanation: Option (1) is correct because Peter has ratified the contract, which means he has consented to the unauthorized acts of the agent. Therefore, Peter is bound by the contract just as if Alan had been authorized to make it in the first place. He cannot sue for breach of warranty of authority. Option (2) is incorrect because revocation refers to terminating authority, not creating it. Option (3) is incorrect because apparent authority arises from agency by estoppel. Agency by estoppel is not present here, as there was no representation made by Peter, reliance by a third party and an alteration of the third party’s position based on that reliance. Option (4) is incorrect because Option (1) is true."
"Question 22: You have a partially completed appraisal report that you need to fill in. The subject property has 4 bathrooms and an air conditioner. The house next door is similar in all respects except for the number of bathrooms and air conditioner. It sold for $334,000 and was adjusted +$6,700 for bathrooms and +$5,500 for the air conditioner. If the market value of a bathroom is $6,700 and the market value of an air conditioner is $5,500, you can conclude that this comparable has: 
(1)5 bathrooms and no air conditioner. 
(2)3 bathrooms and an air conditioner. 
(3)3 bathrooms and no air conditioner. 
(4)4 bathrooms and an air conditioner.","Answer: 3 Explanation: Option (3) is correct because a positive adjustment of $6,700 for bathrooms indicates that the comparable has one less bathroom than the subject property (3 bathrooms), and a positive adjustment of $5,500 for the air conditioner indicates that the comparable does not have an air conditioner. Options (1), (2), and (4) are incorrect for this reason."
"Question 23: An appeal from the small claims court is to which of the following? 
(1)The British Columbia Supreme Court 
(2)The Federal Court of Appeal 
(3)The British Columbia Court of Appeal 
(4)The Small Claims Court of Appeal","Answer: 1 Explanation: Option (1) is correct because an appeal from small claims court is to the British Columbia Supreme Court. Options (2), (3), and (4) are incorrect for this reason."
"Question 24: What will be the maximum loan granted on a commercial building with a lending value of $5,550,000 and yielding a net operating income of $360,000 per year, where the lender requires a debt coverage ratio of 1.35 and a 60% loan-to-value ratio? The loan will be amortized over 20 years with annual payments and the interest rate is 7% per annum, compounded annually. Round your answer to the nearest $1,000. 
(1)$2,814,000 
(2)$3,330,000 
(3)$3,592,000

"Question 25: Zelda was in a good mood one day, and she went over to her next door neighbour Herb’s house and cleaned all his gutters. When Herb returned home from work, he was thrilled by what Zelda had done and he said, “Zelda, I am going to give you a case of wine for doing this.” Weeks passed, and finally Zelda asked Herb when she could expect to receive her wine. Herb said that he had changed his mind. Zelda is now furious and wants to sue Herb in small claims court for a breach of contract. Which of the following statements is most relevant to these facts? 
(1)An invitation to treat is distinguishable from an offer because it cannot form a binding contract, if accepted. 
(2)A voidable contract exists until it is repudiated by the party entitled to do so. 
(3)Past consideration is no consideration. 
(4)Breach of a condition of a contract entitles the injured party to terminate the contract.","Answer: 3 Explanation: Option (3) is relevant and therefore correct because although Herb offered a case of wine as present consideration, the cleaning of the gutters was past consideration. Since past consideration is no consideration, no contract formed between Herb and Zelda. Option (1) is incorrect because an invitation to treat is typically an advertisement or other statement from one party inviting another party to make a legal offer. No invitation to treat appears in this scenario. Option (2) is incorrect because there is no voidable contract to be repudiated on the facts. Option (4) is not relevant because the issue is whether there was consideration to give rise to a valid contract in the first place."
"Question 26: Which one of the following is the generally accepted accounting principle that determines what amount will be recorded on the company’s balance sheet as the value of a building at the time of purchase? 
(1)The objectivity principle 
(2)The consistency principle 
(3)The revenue recognition principle 
(4)The cost principle","Answer: 4 Explanation: Option (4) is correct because the cost principle states that a company must record the value of an asset as the price paid at the time of acquisition. Option (1) is incorrect because the objectivity principle states that all values must be objective and verifiable. Option (2) is incorrect because the consistency principle states that once a company adopts a certain accounting policy, they should continue to use that same policy. Option (3) is incorrect because the revenue recognition principle states that revenue must be recorded when it is earned, not when cash is received."
"Question 27: In order for a trading services representative to be liable for a negligent misrepresentation, certain facts must be proven. Which of the following is NOT a requirement for establishing a claim based upon negligent misrepresentation? 
(1)A contractual relationship must exist between the representative and the person to whom the representation is made. 
(2)The statement may be either one of fact or an opinion given by the representative. 
(3)The statement must be reasonably relied upon by the person to whom it was made, and damage must result from that reliance. 
(4)The representative must make no clear disclaimer of liability for the accuracy of the statement.","Answer: 1 Explanation: Option (1) is correct because a contractual relationship does not need to exist between the parties when a negligent misrepresentation is made. For example, a licensee acting for a seller could be held liable for negligent misrepresentation for a statement made to a buyer despite having no contractual relationship with the buyer. Option (2) is incorrect because the statement made may be fact or opinion as the representative is a skilled person and the other party may reasonably rely on it. Option (3) is incorrect because there is a requirement of reliance on the statement and resulting damage from that reliance to establish a claim of negligent misrepresentation. Option (4) is incorrect because a representative can make a clear disclaimer that they will not be liable for the accuracy of the statement."
"Question 28: Sally, an appraiser, has been asked to provide an estimate of the market value of a farmhouse and the surrounding property. Which one of the following would NOT affect her estimate of market value? 
(1)One of the pastures on the property has been leased for two years to the owner of a racehorse. 
(2)The owner of the farmhouse is anxious to move and would like to sell as soon as possible. 
(3)The farmhouse and its surrounding property are located between the main road and the next door neighbour’s property. Therefore, the neighbour gets the benefit of access to his house by means of a road that runs through the farmhouse property. 
(4)Homehold Finance Company recently loaned some money, at a below-market interest rate, to the owner of the farmhouse and secured the debt with a mortgage on the farmhouse. This mortgage is assumable.","Answer: 2 Explanation: Option (2) is the correct answer as it is the only option listed that does not affect the legal rights of ownership of the property. Options (1), (3), and (4) represent legal interests or charges that will affect the appraiser’s estimate of market value."
"Question 29: The book value of an asset can be BEST defined as which of the following? 
(1)The purchase price of that asset less any depreciation taken to date 
(2)The price for which a similar asset could currently be purchased in the market 
(3)The price at which the asset could be sold 
(4)A value that is subjectively arrived at by an appraiser","Answer: 1 Explanation: Option (1) is correct because the book value of an asset is calculated as the purchase price of the asset, less all of the accumulated depreciation to date. Options (2) and (3) are incorrect as they both refer to the market value of the asset, and Option (4) is incorrect as it refers to the appraised value of an asset."
"Question 30: In the situation where a residential tenant under a fixed term tenancy abandons the premises prior to the end of the term, the obligation imposed on the landlord to try to re-rent the premises as quickly as possible is referred to as: 
(1)the duty to mitigate damages. 
(2)the covenant of quiet enjoyment. 
(3)derogation from the grant. 
(4)the doctrine of interesse termini.","Answer: 1 Explanation: Option (1) is correct because the duty to mitigate damages means that the innocent party must try to reduce the loss suffered as a result of the breach. In this case, reducing the loss of income from the rent would occur by re-renting the premises as soon as possible. Options (2), (3), and (4) are incorrect as they refer to other legal principles."
"Question 31: Scrambling credit card information into an unreadable format is BEST known as which of the following? 
(1)Cryptomizing 
(2)Digitizing 
(3)Encrypting 
(4)Instilling","Answer: 3 Explanation: Option (3) is correct because cryptomizing information protects it by encrypting it into an unreadable format. Only those with a secret key or code can decipher the information. Options (1), (2), and (4) are incorrect for this reason."
"Question 32: Which of the following most correctly completes the phrase: “A mortgage is ...”? 
(1)a contract, evidence of a loan, and required to be registered to be effective between the parties. 
(2)a contract, evidence of a loan, and security for a loan. 
(3)a contract, and a loan. 
(4)a contract, evidence of a loan, security for a loan, and required to be registered to be effective between the parties.",Answer: 2 Explanation: Option (2) is correct as it describes a mortgage. Options (1) and (4) are incorrect because a mortgage does not necessarily need to be registered to be effective between the parties. This principle is embodied in section 20(1) of the Land Title Act. Option (3) is incorrect because a mortgage is not a loan. It is an interest in land created by contract as security for a loan made by a lender to the borrower.
"Question 33: Which of the following statements is FALSE? 
(1)An appraisal mistake of $3,000 on a $276,000 house is beyond the margin of allowable error. 
(2)Form reports often meet the needs of financial institutions, insurance companies, and government agencies. 
(3)The burden of proof is on the appraiser to explain an apparent over-valuation of a property. 
(4)An appraiser may be responsible to any party who reasonably relies on the appraisal report for the purpose it was conducted.","Answer: 1 Explanation: Option (1) is false and therefore correct, because the allowable margin of error is 10%, and the $3,000 error falls within this margin. Options (2), (3), and (4) are incorrect because these statements are all true."
"Question 34: An investment corporation purchased an apartment building on March 31, 2011 for $2,800,000. Of that $2,800,000, $1,700,000 was attributed to the building and $1,100,000 to the land. Depreciation was to be claimed at $50,000 per year for the life of the building. The building component of the property was valued on March 31, 2021, to be $2,400,000. What would be the net amount of the building appearing on the corporation’s Statement of Assets and Liabilities as at March 31, 2021? 
(1)$1,700,000 
(2)$1,200,000 
(3)$2,400,000 
(4)$1,900,000","Answer: 2 Explanation: Option (2) is correct. Land is not considered to be a depreciable asset and thus, depreciation expense is never taken on land. Depreciation expense is only taken on the building."
"Question 35: Chadwick is the listing licensee for a house. According to the Real Estate Services Rules, Chadwick does NOT need to provide his client, the seller, with a Disclosure of Interest in Trade form if the party making the offer to purchase the house is: 
(1)a corporation in which Chadwick holds 20% of the shares. 
(2)Chadwick’s wife. 
(3)Chadwick himself. 
(4)Chadwick’s friend and tennis partner.","Answer: 4 Explanation: Option (4) is correct because a licensee is required to provide a Disclosure of Interest in Trade form when there is an offer by the licensee to directly or indirectly acquire real estate. An offer by Chad’s friend is neither of these. Option (1) is incorrect because an offer by a corporation in which Chad owns over 5% of the shares is an offer to indirectly acquire real estate. Option (2) is incorrect because an offer by Chad’s wife is also an offer to indirectly acquire real estate. Option (3) is incorrect because it is a direct offer to acquire real estate. In these three situations, Chad must provide a Disclosure of Interest in Trade form."

(1)Breach of contract 
(2)Trespass 
(3)Constitutional law 
(4)None of the above",Answer: 3 Explanation: Option (3) is correct because “public law” deals with the Constitution and matters between private individuals and the state. Options (1) and (2) are incorrect because these fall under the category of “private law”.
"Question 39: Which of the following is NOT required in a notice of the end of the tenancy agreement by a tenant under the Residential Tenancy Act? 
(1)Written notice signed by the tenant 
(2)The address of the premises for which the notice is given 
(3)The occupations of the parties 
(4)The date of termination of the tenancy","Answer: 3 Explanation: Option (3) is correct because the occupation of the parties is not required in a notice of the end of the tenancy agreement by a tenant. Options (1), (2), and (4) are incorrect they are all required in a notice of the end of the tenancy agreement."

(1)The residual method 
(2)The cost approach 
(3)The income approach 
(4)The depreciation approach","Answer: 4 Explanation: Option (4) is the correct answer as the depreciation approach is not a method of appraisal. Options (1), (2), and (3) all represent valid appraisal approaches and are therefore incorrect."
"Question 41: Adel is a trading services licensee acting for a developer who is purchasing large blocks of land in Vancouver for a large development. Adel purchases some lots in the area for himself and discloses his identity to the sellers as required by the Real Estate Services Act on those purchases. He does not mention the purchases to his principal, the developer. Shortly thereafter, Adel makes a profit on the resale of his lots due to the effects of his principal’s development on the real estate market. What is this an example of? 
(1)A good business deal that is perfectly acceptable at law 
(2)A use of information that will always, even with disclosure to the principal, be prohibited 
(3)A profit for which Adel must account to his principal 
(4)Adel’s activities are examples of both (2) and (3)","Answer: 3 Explanation: Option (3) is correct because there is a duty on the real estate licensee to tell his or her client everything relevant to the transaction within the agent’s knowledge. In this case, because the licensee has a personal interest in the transaction, he must disclose it to the client, but the transaction is not automatically prohibited. Options (1), (2), and (4) are therefore incorrect."
"Question 42: Which of the following statements about the principles that apply to all strata developments in British Columbia is TRUE? 
(1)The Strata Property Act generally does not apply on First Nation reserve land, subject to some exceptions. 
(2)The strata division of the Civil Resolution Tribunal conducts random audits to verify the compliance of strata corporations with strata legislation. 
(3)Residential strata developments that consist of 3 or fewer units are not required to hold annual general meetings. 
(4)Commercial and industrial strata developments are subject to a separate and enhanced subset of compliance requirements under the Strata Property Act.","Answer: 1 Explanation: Option (1) is correct because First Nation reserve land constitutes an exclusively federal undertaking under the Constitution Act, 1867, and therefore, provincial legislation such as the Strata Property Act (“SPA”) generally does not apply on such lands, subject to the leasehold landlord provisions in the SPA. Option (2) is incorrect because while the owners may apply to the Civil Resolution Tribunal (CRT) to make binding decisions when a dispute arises, the CRT’s role does not involve proactive efforts such as random audits to ensure compliance. Option (3) is incorrect because all strata corporations are required to hold annual general meetings to comply with the SPA, regardless of their size. There are, however, options for strata corporations to waive the requirement to hold an annual general meeting. Option (4) is incorrect because the same fundamental legal principles apply to all strata developments, and commercial and industrial strata developments are not subject to enhanced compliance requirements under the SPA."
"Question 43: In the context of appraisal, which one of the following properties is MOST likely to possess latent value? 
(1)A three-storey condominium development that has recently been completed, all units having been sold before completion of construction 
(2)A single-family residence that is the only house on the block not yet converted to the commercial use that is permitted by zoning 
(3)A large shopping mall/office tower complex that occupies a location at the intersection of two main streets in a British Columbia municipality 
(4)A sports store that is built on land zoned for commercial use","Answer: 2 Explanation: A property possesses latent value if its current state does not represent its highest and best use. Option (2) possesses latent value as the property would have more value if the single-family home was removed and a commercial use building was developed. Options (1), (3), and (4) are incorrect, as these properties are currently being utilized at their highest and best use."
"Question 44: Which of the following statements about the criminal offence of misleading advertising in section 52 of the Competition Act is FALSE? 
(1)The offence involves the making of a representation to the public that is false or misleading in a material respect, for the purpose of promoting any business interest. 
(2)To escape liability, one must show that they honestly believed that the representations were not false or misleading and exercised due diligence in making sure that was the case. 
(3)A “representation” to the public includes print and digital representations, but not oral representations. 
(4)The requirement that the representation be false in a material respect refers to the whether the representation would have a real effect on an ordinary consumer’s buying decision.","Answer: 3 Explanation: Option (3) is false and therefore correct, because the representations covered by section 52 can be by “any means whatsoever” and can include oral representations. They are not limited to just print and digital representations. Options (1), (2), and (4) are true statements and are therefore incorrect."
"Question 45: Which of the following is TRUE? In a strata plan, the term “unit entitlement” refers to: 
(1)the value of each condominium unit relative to other units. 
(2)the share of the value upon demolition owned by each condominium unit owner. 
(3)the share of real property taxes payable by each condominium unit owner. 
(4)the number used to calculate a strata owner’s contribution to the common expenses of the strata corporation.","Answer: 4 Explanation: Option (4) is correct as it describes the term “unit entitlement”. Options (1), (2), and (3) are false because unit entitlement refers to determining each owner’s proportionate, undivided ownership share of the common property in the strata plan. It is used to determine the share of the strata corporation’s expenses and liabilities for which each strata lot owner is responsible."
"Question 46: A revocation of an offer is effective when which of the following occurs? 
(1)A notice of revocation is mailed 
(2)It is communicated to the offeree

"Question 47: Brad Jones, a prospective home buyer, has applied for a mortgage loan to finance the purchase of a townhouse listed at $276,000. The market value of the townhouse is $275,000 and the lender has assigned a $270,000 lending value to it. Assume that the monthly payments on Mr. Jones’ loan are agreed to be $1,120 and annual property taxes are $2,500. Calculate the minimum level of the borrower’s annual income necessary to support these monthly payments, if the lender’s gross debt service ratio is 32%. 
(1)$50,000.00 
(2)$75,000.00 
(3)$49,812.50

"Question 48: The British Columbia Financial Services Authority does NOT have to: 
(1)cancel a licensee’s licence. 
(2)use funds from administrative penalties for non-educational purposes. 
(3)order unlicensed individuals to pay a monetary penalty for providing real estate services without a licence. 
(4)apply to court to appoint a receiver over the property of a licensee.","Answer: 2 Explanation: Option (2) is correct because the BC Financial Services Authority (BCFSA) may only use funds from administrative penalties for educational purposes, and specifically, to educate the public, licensees, and other participants in the real estate industry about the operation and regulation of the industry and issues related to real estate and real estate services. The remaining options are incorrect because BCFSA has authority to exercise those powers."
"Question 49: Johnny Collins tried to design and build his new home to be as energy efficient in heating as possible throughout the cold winter months. Which one of the following decisions was a mistake? 
(1)Using metal framed windows with a thermal break 
(2)Including an air to heat exchanger to warm incoming cold exterior air 
(3)Following R-2000 standards 
(4)Installing sliding glass doors to a north-facing patio","Answer: 4 Explanation: Option (4) is correct because it is an example of an inefficient use in heating. Large windows and doors facing south are desirable to make a home as energy efficient as possible. Options (1), (2), and (3) represent characteristics of an energy efficient home and are therefore incorrect."
"Question 50: In British Columbia, a lender who holds a mortgage registered as a charge on an otherwise clear title to a borrower’s land has: 
(1)the equitable right to redeem the mortgage. 
(2)an interest in land created by contract. 
(3)priority over every other subsequent creditor and lienholder in respect of the mortgaged land. 
(4)the right to retain the mortgagor’s duplicate certificate of title to the mortgaged land until the loan is repaid in full.","Answer: 2 Explanation: Option (2) is correct because it describes a mortgage. A mortgage is not a loan itself; it is an interest in land that provides security for the loan. Option (1) is incorrect because the first registered mortgage provides the lender with a legal (rather than an equitable) right of redemption. This is subject to the borrower’s equity of redemption, which allows the borrower to repay the mortgage after the contractual date for payment. Option (3) is incorrect because a mortgage lender can lose its priority over certain charges even though the mortgage was registered first. Examples of these include builders liens, Strata Property Act judgments, property tax liens, wage claim certificates and workers compensation claims. Option (4) is incorrect because retaining the mortgagor’s duplicate certificate of title to the land creates an equitable mortgage. The lender cannot register this equitable mortgage as a charge at the land title office."
"Question 51: When a mortgagor grants a mortgage after having a registered first mortgage on title, the mortgagor has created: 
(1)an equitable mortgage. 
(2)a legal mortgage. 
(3)an assignment of the first mortgage. 
(4)a vendor take-back mortgage.","Answer: 1 Explanation: Option (1) is correct. The first registered mortgage is a legal mortgage, while any subsequent registered mortgage will be an equitable mortgage charging the borrower’s equity of redemption. Option (2) is therefore incorrect. Option (3) is incorrect because an assignment of a first mortgage is done by the lender to a third party, who is then entitled to enforce the lender’s rights directly against the borrower. Option (4) is incorrect because a vendor take-back mortgage occurs only where a purchaser of property grants a mortgage interest to the vendor of that property."
"Question 52: Which of the following statements about fee simple estate is TRUE? 
(1)Fee simple is a type of leasehold estate. 
(2)If a fee simple owner dies without a will, the property will escheat to the crown. 
(3)The term fee simple indicates an estate that can be inherited without qualification. 
(4)The fee simple estate was created by the Torrens system of registration.","Answer: 3 Explanation: Option (3) is correct because originally, the word “fee” meant that the estate could be inherited, and the word “simple” meant that there was no qualification on the type of heir that could inherit. Option (1) is incorrect because a fee simple estate is a greater interest in land than a leasehold estate, which time-limited. Option (2) is incorrect because if the owner of the estate in fee simple does not dispose of a property by will, the owner’s heirs will inherit the estate in fee simple. Option (4) is incorrect because the concept of fee simple was created before the Torrens system of registration."
"Question 53: In British Columbia, there are three basic requirements for an easement. Which one of the following is a requirement? 
(1)The easement must be negative in nature. 
(2)The easement must accommodate the servient tenement. 
(3)The dominant and servient tenements must be owned by different parties. 
(4)The easement must be capable of forming the subject matter of a grant.","Answer: 4 Explanation: Option (4) is correct. The form the subject matter of a grant, the easement must be capable of reasonably exact definition, and the party who grants and whose land benefits from the easement must have the necessary capacity to be grantor and grantee. Option (1) is incorrect because an easement can be either positive or negative in nature (in comparison to a restrictive covenant, which must be negative in nature). Option (2) is incorrect because the easement must accommodate the dominant tenement, not the servient tenement. Option (3) is incorrect because one party can own both the dominant and servient tenement provided that they are two different parcels of land."
"Question 54: A pre-approved mortgage for a residential property: 
(1)will always guarantee the borrower’s interest rate for 365 days. 
(2)calculates the minimum loan that the borrower qualifies for. 
(3)is based on the borrower’s current financial situation and a satisfactory credit review. 
(4)is based on a formula provided by the Fair Isaac Corporation.","Answer: 3 Explanation: Option (3) is correct because mortgage lenders may pre-approve a potential borrower for a mortgage based on his or her current financial situation and a satisfactory credit review. Options (1), (2) and (4) are incorrect."
"Question 55: Which appraisal approach/method would be MOST suitable to appraise a new pulp mill in Squamish? 
(1)Market comparison 
(2)Residual 
(3)Income 
(4)Cost","Answer: 4 Explanation: Option (4) is correct because a pulp mill in Squamish is likely very unique without any comparable properties, so the cost approach must be used. Options (1), (2), and (3) are incorrect because these are likely inappropriate methods to appraise such a property, given its unique character."
"Question 56: The court will not normally grant the remedy of specific performance where: 
(1)the plaintiff is a limited company. 
(2)the defendant is without means. 
(3)damages are considered to be an adequate remedy. 
(4)the contract has already been partially performed.","Answer: 3 Explanation: Option (3) is correct because the overriding principle of specific performance is that it will not be exercised when damages are an adequate remedy. Options (1), (2), and (4) are incorrect because they are irrelevant to the determination of an award of specific performance."
"Question 57: Coralee asked Tim to sell her car and her mountain bike for her while she was away on holiday. She gave Tim the keys to the car and told him to accept any price in excess of $1,700 for the car and $300 for the bike. Which of the following is an example of implied authority? 
(1)Tim sold the car to Cherise for $1,750. 
(2)Before Cherise was willing to purchase the car, she insisted that she test drive the car and have it checked by the automobile association, which Tim allowed her to do. 
(3)When Cherise was viewing the car, she noticed a small roof rack sitting in Coralee’s garage. She said that she would like to buy the rack to carry her camping gear on Coralee’s car. Tim said that he would include the rack in the sale for an additional $75, to which Cherise agreed. When Coralee returned, she told Tim that she was pleased that he had sold the rack, since she had no more use for it. 
(4)After advertising the bike for sale at $300 in vain, Tim sold the bike to Sandra, the only person to make an offer, for $260. Coralee accepted the money when she returned, although she was disappointed not to get the full price.","Answer: 2 Explanation: Option (2) is correct because the act of test driving the car and having it inspected is necessary in order to enable Tim to carry out the express authority and is incidental to that authority. It is therefore an example of implied authority. Option (1) is incorrect because it is an example of express authority. Option (3) and (4) are incorrect because they are examples of acts that Tim does not have actual or apparent authority to do. Therefore, authority cannot be implied for these acts."
"Question 58: In order to advertise to a wider audience, a licensee has decided to create his own website. Based on the information in the Knowledge Base Guidelines for Internet/Social Media Advertising, which of the following is a general guideline that the licensee should follow? 
(1)The name of the brokerage can be excluded in online advertising. 
(2)He can advertise another licensee’s listings directly on his own website without permission from the listing brokerage in order to increase business. 
(3)If the licensee is a member of a team, the team name must be included on the licensee’s website but not in social media advertising. 
(4)If linking to an outside database of available properties, it should be clear to consumers which listings are his and which are not.","Answer: 4 Explanation: Option (4) is the correct answer because consumers should clearly be able to differentiate a licensee’s own listings from other available properties. Option (1) is incorrect because the name of the brokerage must appear in a prominent and easily readable form on all internet and social media advertising vehicles. Option (2) is incorrect because licensees should NOT advertise other licensees’ listings directly on their own website without the approval of the listing licensee. Option (3) is incorrect because if a licensee is a member of a team, the team name has to be included in social media advertising as well as on the licensee’s website."
"Question 59: Common property in a strata title development is: 
(1)owned equally by all members of the strata corporation. 
(2)owned by the strata corporation. 
(3)owned jointly by the strata corporation and the strata council. 
(4)any property not designated as strata lots on a strata plan.","Answer: 4 Explanation: Option (4) is correct because section 1 of the Strata Property Act defines common property as any property not designated as strata lots on a strata plan. Options (1), (2), and (3) are incorrect because common property is owned by the members of the strata corporation, each in the proportion set out in the Schedule of Unit Entitlement."
"Question 60: Which of the following is/are included in the residential borrower qualification process? 
(1)Collecting information about the borrower and the property 
(2)Evaluating the applicants’ ability to meet the terms of a mortgage and the amount of their income 
(3)Analyzing the real property pledged as security for the loan and the applicant’s credit report 
(4)All of the above","Answer: 4 Explanation: Option (4) is the correct answer; Options (1), (2), and (3) are all included in the residential borrower qualification process. Lenders engage in many types of analysis to qualify a borrower to reduce the risk of lending."
"Question 61: Which of the following accurately summarizes the “requirement of writing” contained in section 59 of the Law and Equity Act? 
(1)A contract respecting land must be in writing or it is void. 
(2)A contract respecting land can never be enforced against a party who has not signed it. 
(3)A contract for the sale of land must be contained in one written document. 
(4)None of the above three statements accurately summarizes the requirement of writing.","Answer: 4 Explanation: Option (4) is correct because none of the other statements accurately describe the requirement of writing. Option (1) is incorrect because an unwritten contract or disposition of land can be enforced against a party who has done or acquiesced in an act that indicates that contract or disposition has been made. It can also be enforced if the person alleging the contract or disposition has changed his position in reliance on such an act and it would be inequitable not to enforce the contract or disposition. Given this, Option (2) is also incorrect. Option (3) is incorrect because there is no requirement that a contract for the sale of land be contained in one written document."
"Question 62: Which of the following is TRUE? The “possession date” in a standard form contract of purchase and sale is: 
(1)the date on which adjustments are made between the parties for property taxes, etc. 
(2)the date on which the buyer takes vacant possession of the property, subject to any existing tenancy agreements. 
(3)always the same day as the completion date. 
(4)the date on which the buyer must assume responsibility for risk of loss or damage to the property.","Answer: 2 Explanation: Option (2) is correct. Option (1) is false as the date on which adjustments are made between the parties for property taxes, interest, rent and other appropriate items is known as the adjustment date. Option (3) is false because the possession date is not always the same date as the completion date. Registration (performed on the completion date) takes some time to effect, so to set the possession date on the same date as the completion date may not be ideal. Option (4) is false because the buyer assumes responsibility for risk of loss or damage to the property on the completion date, when the buyer is registered on title at the Land Title Office."
"Question 63: The “term” of a mortgage ALWAYS: 
(1)necessitates the payment of an outstanding balance payment. 
(2)specifies the duration of the contractual relationship. 
(3)is equal to the amortization period. 
(4)is shorter than the amortization period.",Answer: 2 Explanation: Option (2) is correct because the term of a mortgage is the contractual period for which a borrower will make constant payments to the lender. Option (1) is incorrect because a partially amortized mortgage would not require payment of an outstanding balance at the end of the term. This is only required in the instance where a mortgage is fully amortized and the term length equals the amortization period. Option (3) is incorrect because incorrect because the term length of a partially amortized mortgage would be less than the amortization period. Option (4) is incorrect because the term length of a fully amortized mortgage would be equal to the amortization period.
"Question 64: Which of the following options BEST describes a building scheme? 
(1)It is a special example of a group of easements attaching to two or more lots in a development. 
(2)It is a set of restrictions on a development used to maintain uniformity. 
(3)It is used by developers to protect the buyer’s rights to build according to their own tastes. 
(4)It is a document filed with the disclosure statement on a conversion of an existing building to a condominium.","Answer: 2 Explanation: Option (2) is correct because a building scheme is defined in the Land Title Act as a set of restrictive covenants imposed on two or more lots within a particular subdivision, generally used to maintain uniformity of the lots to protect their value. Option (1) is incorrect because building schemes are used to impose restrictions on all owners of the affected properties, while easements are granted to confer rights to the dominant tenement. Option (3) is incorrect because the restrictive covenants in a building scheme will disallow the buyer from building to their own tastes if these contravene the covenants. Option (4) is incorrect because a building scheme is registered by a Declaration of Creation of a Building Scheme which is separate from any required disclosure statement."
"Question 65: A mortgage broker is arranging a fully amortized mortgage loan with a face value of $240,000. The loan contract is to be written at 8% per annum, compounded semi-annually.

(1)The assignment from B to C must be for the entire amount. 
(2)The assignment from B to C must be in writing. 
(3)The notification from C to A must be in writing. 
(4)The notification from A to B must be in writing.","Answer: 4 Explanation: Option (4) is correct and Options (1), (2), and (3) are incorrect because the three requirements for a statutory assignment are that it is in writing, it is absolute and unconditional, and notice of the assignment is given to the original promissor."

"Question 69: In answer to the ringing of her doorbell, Kim opened the front door of her house to find a door-to-door vacuum salesperson on her doorstep. The salesperson walked into Kim’s house uninvited. Before Kim could stop him, he dumped some dirt onto her carpet for use in a demonstration of the vacuum cleaner he was selling. The dirt stained Kim’s carpet. Her lawyer correctly advises Kim that: 
(1)the salesperson may be liable in negligence for the damage he caused to the carpet. 
(2)the salesperson may be liable to Kim under British Columbia’s Occupiers Liability Act. 
(3)Kim will not recover any damages in a lawsuit against the salesperson because he was a trespasser. 
(4)she will probably succeed in a lawsuit based on the tort of private nuisance.","Answer: 1 Explanation: Option (1) is correct because the salesperson likely has a duty of care towards Kim when coming onto her property and demonstrating something to her. He may be found to have breached the standard of care by failing to take reasonable precautions not to damage her property. Option (2) is incorrect because the salesperson is not an occupier, and the Occupiers Liability Act deals only with liability to an occupier. Option (3) is incorrect because the fact that the salesperson is a trespasser does not bar Kim from recovering damages stemming from his conduct on her property. Option (4) is incorrect because the salesperson’s actions are more akin to trespass than private nuisance. The fact that the salesperson entered onto Kim’s land and placed something upon it and that it was an isolated occurrence point towards trespass rather than private nuisance."

They project that the building’s net operating income for the next five years will be $600,000 per year. Current mortgage terms on office building projects are j1 = 5.5%, amortized over 20 years with quarterly payments. Orca Bank feels that Flower Garden Company is optimistic in their net operating income projections and has therefore set the required debt coverage ratio at 1.4. What is Flower Garden’s maximum allowable loan, rounded to the nearest $1,000?

"Question 73: The position a product or service holds within its consumers’ minds is BEST known as which of the following options? 
(1)Product positioning 
(2)Product mapping 
(3)Product assessment 
(4)Product differentiation","Answer: 1 Explanation: Option (1) is correct because product positioning refers to the position a product or service holds within the minds of its consumers. Options (2), (3), and (4) are incorrect for this reason."
"Question 74: Using the cost approach of appraisal, what will be the market value of a property with a 50,000 square foot building if construction costs new are $48 per square foot, land value is $900,000, and total depreciation on the structure to date is estimated to be 10%? 
(1)$3,105,000 
(2)$3,060,000 
(3)$3,000,000 
(4)$3,300,000","Answer: 2 Explanation: Find the market value using the cost method of appraisal. Site Value: $900,000 + Cost of Improvements = $48  50,000 = $2,400,000  Depreciation $2,400,000  0.10 = $240,000 Market value = $900,000 + $2,400,000  $240,000 = $3,060,000"
"Question 75: Which of the following statements is TRUE when calculating income taxes payable for a corporation? 
(1)Depreciation expense cannot be treated as a deductible expense. 
(2)Capital cost allowance cannot be treated as a deductible expense. 
(3)The computation of taxable income is irrelevant. 
(4)It is necessary to know what the amount of declared dividends will be.","Answer: 1 Explanation: Option (1) is correct because depreciation expense cannot be deducted from taxable income. Instead, the Income Tax Act permits a capital cost allowance deduction from taxable income. Option (2) is therefore incorrect. Option (3) is incorrect because taxable income is used to calculate income taxes payable. Option (4) is incorrect because any declared dividends are important for taxation, as corporations receive special tax treatment for declaring and paying cash dividends."
"Question 76: Gheeta was out walking and saw a “For Sale” sign on the lawn of a house called Green Acres. She decided to ask the owners about the price of the property. Unknown to Gheeta, the owners of Green Acres were away on a long vacation in Jamaica. As Gheeta was walking across the lawn of Green Acres, a long branch from an old tree that grew in a neighbouring yard fell down and hit her. As a result, Gheeta broke her leg and could not return to work for two months. Which of the following statements is TRUE? 
(1)The owners of Green Acres will be held liable to Gheeta for her lost wages only if she can prove they knew of the hazard presented by the old tree. 
(2)The owners of Green Acres will not be held liable to Gheeta because they were not home at the time of the accident. 
(3)Only the owners of the tree are liable to Gheeta for her lost wages. 
(4)The owners of Green Acres may be liable to Gheeta even though they were not home at the time of the accident.","Answer: 4 Explanation: Option (4) is correct because the owners of Green Acres, as “occupiers”, owe a duty to take reasonable care to ensure that persons entering their property will be reasonably safe. Despite being away on vacation, the owners of Green Acres are “occupiers” for the purposes of the Occupiers Liability Act because they maintain responsibility for, and control over, their property even while physically absent. Ensuring the safety of persons entering onto their property may have required the owners of Green Acres to take steps to address the hazard posed by the old, overhanging tree branch. If this is the case, the owners will be liable to Gheeta for her injury. Option (1) is incorrect because the risk of the tree hurting someone who comes onto the property only needs to be reasonably foreseeable, not known by the owners of Green Acres. Option (2) is incorrect because it is irrelevant whether the owners of Green Acres were home or not at the time of the injury. Option (3) is incorrect because Gheeta was injured on Green Acres and those who fall under the definition of an “occupier” of Green Acres under the Occupiers Liability Act, such as the owners of Green Acres, may also be liable to Gheeta for damages."
"Question 77: When a bidder’s ceiling price for a lot is $30,500 and the owner’s floor price is $32,500: 
(1)the parties could negotiate and produce a sale. 
(2)a sale cannot take place. 
(3)the sale price of the lot will be $31,500. 
(4)neither party is behaving reasonably.","Answer: 2 Explanation: Option (2) is correct because if a bidder’s ceiling price is $30,500, then this is the highest he will bid — he’s hit the ceiling. If an owner’s floor price is $32,500, then this is the lowest the owner will go. Therefore, a sale cannot take place because there is no price the bidder is willing pay that the owner will accept. Option (1) is incorrect because the ceiling and floor prices are the highest and lowest that the parties will go, respectively. A sale price cannot be negotiated outside of each party’s price range. Option (3) is incorrect for this reason. Option (4) is incorrect because there is no indication that the parties are behaving unreasonably."
"Question 78: Which one of the following is NOT a requirement to establish misrepresentation in contract law? 
(1)There must be an assertion of fact. 
(2)The assertion must be false. 
(3)The assertion must have been material to the formation of the contract. 
(4)The assertion must be in writing.","Answer: 4 Explanation: Option (4) is correct because a misrepresentation is not required to be in writing. Options (1), (2), and (3) are incorrect because the requirements to establish misrepresentation in contract law are that it must be an assertion of fact, it must be false, and it must have been material to the formation of the contract (i.e., it must have reasonably induced the other party to enter into the contract)."
"Question 79: Which of the following statements pertaining to SEO is TRUE? 
(1)SEO refers to how easily a website can be found in paid results on search engines. 
(2)A website that is incompatible with mobile devices may be penalized in search engine results that originate from mobile devices. 
(3)SEO stands for System Efficiency Operations. 
(4)All of the above statements are true.","Answer: 2 Explanation: Option (2) is correct because a website that is not compatible with mobile devices may be penalized in search engine results that originate from mobile devices. Option (1) is incorrect because SEO refers to how easily a website can be found in unpaid (NOT paid) search results. Option (3) is incorrect because SEO stands for Search Engine Optimization. Since Options (1) and (3) are false, Option (4) is incorrect."
"Question 80: A life tenancy has been granted to Avon “without impeachment for waste”. For which of the following actions would Avon be liable? 
(1)Putting new shingles on the garage roof 
(2)Allowing the tool shed to deteriorate and collapse 
(3)Cutting down some trees on the property 
(4)Avon would not be liable in any of the above situations.","Answer: 4 Explanation: Option (4) is correct because Avon would not be liable in any of the previous scenarios. Option (1) is incorrect because it is an example of ameliorating waste. Avon is not liable for ameliorating waste because his life tenancy has been granted “without impeachment for waste.” Option (2) is also incorrect for this reason, as it is an example of permissive waste. Option (3) is incorrect because it is an example of voluntary waste."
"Question 81: The principle of substitution in the comparative approach of appraisal states that: 
(1)“market value” equals “value to owner”. 
(2)similar properties that have recently sold are comparable. 
(3)properties have to be identical in order to be comparable. 
(4)the market value of land plus the cost of a newly constructed building equals the market value of a property.","Answer: 2 Explanation: Option (2) is correct because the principal of substitution in the comparative approach of appraisal states that a property’s value should not exceed the cost of purchasing an alternate property that can provide similar utility. Therefore, similar properties that have recently sold are comparable. Option (1) is incorrect because the value to owner is highly subjective and likely differs from market value. Option (3) is incorrect because it is impossible to find identical properties; however, it is usually possible to find lots with enough common characteristics to regard them as similar for the purpose of appraisal. Option (4) is incorrect because it describes the cost approach, not the comparative approach of appraisal."
"Question 82: A strata lot in British Columbia in an exclusively residential complex is owned by two persons as joint tenants. At every meeting of the strata corporation, the owners are: 
(1)entitled to a total of one vote. 
(2)entitled to the number of votes that is calculated in proportion to their unit entitlement. 
(3)individually entitled to one vote each. 
(4)entitled to a total of one vote where the matter involves a special resolution, but individually entitled to one vote on all other matters.","Answer: 1 Explanation: Option (1) is correct because each strata lot gets one vote. If two or more persons share one vote because they own the strata lot together, only one of them may vote on a given matter. Option (2) is incorrect because votes are allocated one per strata lot, not by unit entitlement. Option (3) is incorrect because votes are allocated one per strata lot, not by individual owner. Option (4) is incorrect because the strata lot is entitled to one vote, regardless of the type of resolution being made."
"Question 83: Which of the following is NOT an example of a breach of contract? 
(1)Don contracted with Toni to buy his car. The night before Don was supposed to pay the price and take the car, the vehicle was struck by lightning in Toni’s driveway and destroyed. 
(2)After Babs contracted with Quin in May to rent his motorhome for one week in July, Quin telephoned Babs and told her that he was going to be using the home himself that week, and that she would not be able to rent it. 
(3)Fred contracted with Jordan to sell Jordan his collection of hockey cards. One day later, Fred sold them to Andrew, who paid him $15 more than the amount Jordan had agreed to pay. 
(4)Adrian contracted to paint Woodie’s house starting on September 1 for a price of $500. On September 1, Adrian failed to appear and did not reply to any of the messages that Woodie left on Adrian’s answering machine.","Answer: 1 Explanation: Option (1) is correct because it is an example of frustration, rather than a breach of contract. Option (2) is incorrect because it is an example of a breach of contract. After the contract was agreed to, Quin did not fulfil his promise under the contract. Option (3) is incorrect because after the contract was agreed to, Fred did not fulfil his promise under the contract. Option (4) is incorrect because after the contract was agreed to, Adrian did not fulfil his promise under the contract."
"Question 84: Which one of the following would NOT be included in the operating expenses of a commercial property for purposes of determining its market value? 
(1)Reserve for replacement of equipment 
(2)Interest on the mortgage 
(3)Property taxes 
(4)Advertising of vacant suites","Answer: 2 Explanation: Option (2) is correct because interest paid on a mortgage is not considered an operating expense. Options (1), (3), and (4) are incorrect because these are all included in operating expenses, which are paid by the landlord."
"Question 85: Diana leased an apartment from Horst for 12 months commencing January 1. On April 1, Horst conveyed the building to Bing. On April 15, Bing gave Diana a notice of end of the tenancy agreement effective May 15. The reason for the termination was that Bing wanted the apartment for his daughter, who had recently been married. Under the Residential Tenancy Act, what is the earliest date by which Bing can require Diana to leave? 
(1)May 31 
(2)May 15 
(3)December 31 
(4)June 30","Answer: 3 Explanation: Option (3) is correct because a fixed term tenancy cannot be terminated by the landlord before the end of the fixed term (i.e., December 31). The earliest that Bing can require Diana to leave is December 31, by serving Diana with a Two Month Notice to End Tenancy for Landlord’s Use of Property on October 31. Options (1), (2), and (4) are incorrect for this reason."
"Question 86: Which one of the following items is NOT likely to be available to an appraiser valuing a commercial property? 
(1)Current lease conditions at the time of sale of the property 
(2)The amount of any registered mortgages 
(3)The buyer’s expected rent and expense forecasts 
(4)Physical characteristics of the building","Answer: 3 Explanation: Option (3) is correct because an appraiser will not be able to obtain the buyer’s expected rent and expense forecasts, as this is not publicly-accessible data. Options (1), (2), and (4) are incorrect because an appraiser valuing a commercial property can obtain documents, filings, and market data outlining things such as current lease conditions at the time of sale of the property, the amount of any registered mortgages, and the physical characteristics of the building."
"Question 87: A board of variance is: 
(1)a provincial board charged with the responsibility of seeing that actions by municipalities comply with the Local Government Act. 
(2)a board established by municipalities with the power to amend property assessments. 
(3)a board established by municipalities to determine whether a zoning bylaw creates undue hardships on property owners. 
(4)a board established by municipalities to settle boundary line disputes between private parties.","Answer: 3 Explanation: Option (3) is correct because a board of variance is a local government board that determines whether a zoning bylaw creates undue hardships on property owners. It can grant a minor variance, provided it does not conflict with the local government’s policies. Option (1) is incorrect because a board of variance is not a provincial board. Option (2) is incorrect because a board of variance does not have the power to amend property assessments. Option (4) is incorrect because while a board of variance may grant minor variances to zoning bylaws, it does not settle property line disputes between private parties."
"Question 88: If Jeff applies for a mortgage loan with gross income of $3,000 per month, property taxes are estimated at $200 per month, and the lender’s permitted gross debt service ratio is 30%, what can Jeff afford to pay for monthly principal and interest? 
(1)$840 
(2)$750 
(3)$700 
(4)$620","Answer: 3 Explanation: Find his monthly principal and interest payment given Jeff’s income, taxes, and his gross debt service ratio of 30%."
"Question 89: Which one of the following statements regarding appraisal is TRUE? 
(1)In order to appraise real property, one needs a minimum of a real estate trading services licence. 
(2)The complexity of real estate as a product requires the involvement of an expert appraiser. 
(3)Real estate can be classified as a homogeneous commodity. 
(4)Due to the low turnover of real estate, it is easy to collect information regarding recent transactions.","Answer: 2 Explanation: Option (2) is correct because real estate as a product is generally unique and complex, requiring expert skills and knowledge for an accurate appraisal. Option (1) is incorrect because no license is required to conduct an appraisal. Option (3) is incorrect because real estate is unique, and therefore cannot be classified as a homogenous commodity. Option (4) is incorrect because the low turnover of real estate makes it difficult to collect information regarding recent sales."
"Question 90: Mary and John own a piece of real property as joint tenants. Which of the following is FALSE? 
(1)Mary could sever the joint tenancy without John’s knowledge. 
(2)Mary and John each have an undivided interest in the property. 
(3)Mary and John each have a right of survivorship. 
(4)Mary and John can have different interests in the property.","Answer: 4 Explanation: Option (4) is false and is therefore the correct answer. The unity of interest requires that all joint tenants have the same estate or interest in land; the extent, nature, and duration must be identical. Option (1) is incorrect in certain scenarios, a joint tenancy can be severed by one of the joint tenants even if the other joint tenant(s) is unaware of the action of the joint tenant severing the joint tenancy. Option (2) is incorrect because in a joint tenancy, the co-owners each have an undivided share in the property. By definition, joint tenants are co-owners of the same interest, whatever that interest may be. Finally, Option (3) is incorrect because a defining feature of joint tenancy is the right of survivorship. This means that when one joint tenant dies, that joint tenant’s estate automatically vests in the surviving joint tenant(s)."
"Question 91: Which of the following options is a disadvantage of using a central, gas-fired, forced air heating system? 
(1)A lack of air filtration 
(2)A slow response time to temperature changes 
(3)It requires ductwork under the main floor 
(4)Heat transmission is by radiation, which is ineffective","Answer: 3 Explanation: Option (3) is correct because central, gas-fired, forced air heating systems require ductwork under the floor, which makes it difficult and expensive to install after the house is already built. Options (1) and (2) are incorrect because these types of heating systems are advantageous in that they also provide air filtration and have a fast response time to temperature changes. Option (4) is incorrect because these types of heating systems transmit heat through convection."
"Question 92: Which of the following statements is TRUE? 
(1)A listing contract is not a specialized form of agency contract. 
(2)Under the Designated Agency system, while the brokerage contracts with the seller or buyer, an individual licensee is appointed to act as the sole agent of that seller or buyer. 
(3)Real estate brokerages always work on behalf of the seller in respect of a real estate transaction. 
(4)An agent’s authority to bind their principal depends entirely on the express authority given by the principal, and not upon implied, usual, or customary authority.","Answer: 2 Explanation: Option (2) is correct because it is true. Option (1) is false because a listing contract is a specialized form of agency contract. It is a contract between the seller and a real estate brokerage. The brokerage promises to try to find a buyer and the seller promises to pay a stated amount of commission if the brokerage is successful. Option (2) is true. Designated Agency eliminates the conflict that previously arose when two licensees in the same brokerage represented both the seller and the buyer in a transaction. Option (3) is false because real estate brokerages can work on behalf of a seller or a buyer on a real estate transaction. Option (4) is false because an agent’s authority to bind his or her principal can arise: (1) expressly; (2) by implication; (3) as a result of the doctrine of estoppel; or, (4) by ratification by the principal of the agent’s acts done on the principal’s behalf."
"Question 93: An amendment to a contract of purchase and sale: 
(1)is generally not legally binding on the seller and buyer until finalized in writing and signed by all parties to the original contract. 
(2)must be signed by at least the seller and selling licensee who negotiated the original contract. 
(3)automatically terminates the contract of purchase and sale. 
(4)can be made only before a buyer’s offer is accepted by a seller.","Answer: 1 Explanation: Option (1) is correct and Option (2) is incorrect because under section 59 of the Law and Equity Act, a contract for the sale of land must generally be in writing and signed by all parties to the contract. Option (3) is incorrect because an amendment to a contract of purchase and sale will state that it does not terminate the existing contract. Option (4) is incorrect because if a change is made to the contract of purchase and sale before the buyer’s offer is accepted, then there is no contract of purchase and sale. It is simply an amendment to the offer (i.e., a counter-offer)."
"Question 94: A mortgage contract with a face value of $175,000 requires monthly payments of $1,103.21 over a 20-year amortization period. However, the mortgage broker advances only $171,000 after deducting a commission of $2,500, legal fees of $1,000, and an appraisal fee of $500. Calculate the cost of funds advanced for the borrower, expressed as an effective annual rate (j1). 
(1)4.730370% 
(2)4.777233% 
(3)3.972254% 
(4)4.834288%","Answer: 4 Explanation: Option 4 is correct. $175,000 is the face value, the amount that the contract is written for. However, there are legal fees, commissions, and appraisal fees that are deducted; therefore, the actual amount that is applied to the loan is $171,000 (present value).

"Question 95: The transfer by the borrower of the equity of redemption to a subsequent buyer does not always relieve the borrower of the covenant to repay the debt. However, there are circumstances where the borrower may be relieved of liability on the personal covenant. Which one of the following events would NOT relieve the borrower from this liability? 
(1)The borrower has received a release from the lender. 
(2)The borrower has sold the property with the knowledge of the lender. 
(3)The Property Law Act releases the borrower. 
(4)The original contract between the lender and the vendor is replaced by a new contract between a lender and the purchaser.","Answer: 2 Explanation: Option (2) is correct because the lender’s knowledge that the property has been sold will not relieve the borrower from liability on his or her personal covenant. Options (1), (3), and (4) are incorrect because these events will relieve the borrower from this liability."
"Question 96: Veronica has agreed to sell her home to Patty for $75,900. The completion and adjustment date is set at November 14. Veronica paid the current year’s property taxes on the date they were due in the amount of $896. It is NOT a leap year. Patty’s share of the year’s property taxes will appear on the seller’s statement of adjustments as a: 
(1)debit of $115.38. 
(2)credit of $115.38. 
(3)debit of $41.73. 
(4)credit of $117.83.","Answer: 4 Explanation: Option (4) is correct because when taxes are previously paid by the seller, the buyer should reimburse the seller for the portion of the year from the adjustment date onward. The reimbursement will appear as a credit on the seller’s statement and a debit on the buyer’s statement. Patty’s share of the year’s property taxes (Nov. 14 B Dec. 31 = 48 days) is calculated in the following manner: 48/365 × $896 = $117.83. Options (1), (2), and (3) are therefore incorrect."
"Question 97: Vince has agreed to sell his home to Pedro for $75,900. To assist in the purchase, Pedro is borrowing $65,000 from his uncle as a first mortgage loan. Pedro’s loan from his uncle will appear: 
(1)as a debit on Pedro’s statement and a credit on Vince’s statement. 
(2)as a credit on Pedro’s statement and a debit on Vince’s statement. 
(3)only on Pedro’s statement. 
(4)only on Vince’s statement.","Answer: 3 Explanation: Option (3) is correct because when a new loan is received by the buyer from a mortgage company or third party, the amount appears only as a credit on the buyer’s statement of adjustments, as a new loan does not affect the seller’s cash proceeds of sale. The $65,000 loan will only appear on Pedro’s statement, as a credit. Options (1), (2), and (4) are therefore incorrect."
"Question 98: Victor has agreed to sell his home to Pamela for $75,900. The completion and adjustment date is set at November 14. The real estate commission payable by Victor is 7% of the selling price. Pamela has made a deposit of $2,000, which the real estate brokerage has passed to Pamela’s lawyer to be deposited in a trust account until the completion date. Victor has agreed to accept Pamela’s diamond ring as part payment equal to $7,500. Pamela is borrowing $65,000 from the Bank of Dad as a first mortgage loan. Victor paid the current year’s property taxes on the date they were due in the amount of $896. Pamela’s lawyer will charge $600 to cover both legal and registration fees. Victor will be paying out a judgment registered against the title to his house in the amount of $6,225 and the legal fee to remove it will be $85. Victor is relying on Pamela’s lawyer to handle this transaction for him. As no exemptions apply to this transaction, property transfer tax will be payable upon completion. It is NOT a leap year. As well, Pamela is NOT a foreign entity for property transfer tax purposes. The balance due to complete required from Pamela is:

"Question 99: Valerie has agreed to sell her home to Phil for $75,900. The real estate commission payable by Valerie is 7% of the selling price. The real estate commission will appear:

(2)on Valerie’s statement only. 
(3)as a debit on Phil’s statement. 
(4)as a credit on Phil’s statement and a debit on Valerie’s statement.","Answer: 2 Explanation: Option (2) is correct because the real estate commission is payable by Valerie and would appear as a debit only on her statement.

"Question 100: A fee simple owner in British Columbia who is the victim of a fraudulent conveyance of their land will lose the right to have the transfer set aside when: 
(1)the transfer of the property to the dishonest person has been registered in the land title office. 
(2)the title to the property has been transferred to a good faith purchaser for valuable consideration. 
(3)the guilty party has been convicted of fraud by a court. 
(4)they notify the registrar of land titles that fraud has occurred.","Answer: 2 Explanation: Option (2) is correct and Options (1), (3), and (4) are incorrect because the only way a victim of a fraudulent conveyance of his or her land will lose the right to have the transfer set aside is when the title to the property has been transferred to a good faith purchaser for valuable consideration."
"Question 101: The flow of information concerning real property is limited and difficult to collect because: 
(1)the turnover rate for real property is high. 
(2)every parcel of real property is homogeneous. 
(3)real property is short-lived and quick to respond to market pressures. 
(4)real property markets are local, with real estate fixed in location.","Answer: 4 Explanation: Option (4) is correct because it is true. Option (1) is incorrect because the turnover rate for real property is low, meaning there are limited data sources and information available upon which to base an opinion of an value. Option (2) is incorrect because every parcel of real property is distinct, unique, and heterogenous, meaning property values cannot be easily standardized or generalized. Option (3) is incorrect because real property is durable and long-lasting, meaning it may not be quick to respond to market pressures."
"Question 102: In Canada, the power to make laws is divided between the federal and provincial levels of government. Which of the following has NOT been assigned to the federal government? 
(1)Jurisdiction over harbours 
(2)Jurisdiction over matters affecting private property and the power to delegate some provincial authority to a third level of government 
(3)Jurisdiction over postal services 
(4)Jurisdiction over the regulations to protect fisheries","Answer: 2 Explanation: Option (2) is correct because these powers have been assigned to the provincial government under the Constitution Act, 1867. Options (1), (3), and (4) are incorrect because these have been assigned to the federal government under the Constitution Act, 1867."
"Question 103: Which one of the following is NOT a course of action that the British Columbia Financial Services Authority can take following a disciplinary hearing? 
(1)Reprimand the licensee 
(2)Order the cancellation of the licensee’s licence 
(3)Suspend the licensee from participation in the Multiple Listing Service® 
(4)Order the licensee to enroll in and complete a course of studies or training","Answer: 3 Explanation: Option (3) is correct because the British Columbia Financial Services Authority (“BCFSA”) cannot suspend the licensee from participation in the Multiple Listing Service (MLS) following a disciplinary hearing.

(1)Jennifer has 45 days to file a builders lien after the project is substantially completed, ended, or abandoned. 
(2)If Jacob sells his property before Jennifer files a builders lien, then any lien she files will affect Jacob, but will not affect the interests of the purchaser.

(1)The crossing of another person’s property by mistake 
(2)The deliberate crossing of another person’s property 
(3)The throwing of an item upon another person’s property 
(4)All of the above","Answer: 4 Explanation: Option (4) is correct because all of the options are examples of trespass. Trespass consists of wrongfully entering, remaining on, or placing something on another’s land. Trespass requires both a voluntary and a direct action. Option (1) is an example of trespass because even though entering the other property was a mistake, it was still intentional since the person had control over where they were walking. Option (2) is an example of trespass because deliberately crossing another person’s property is both voluntary and direct. Option (3) is an example of trespass because even though the person did not personally step on another person’s land, they intentionally threw the item.

"Question 121: After a borrower has given a mortgage of real property, the borrower’s remaining interest is described at law as: 
(1)a right of foreclosure. 
(2)a common law mortgage. 
(3)the equity of redemption. 
(4)an equitable mortgage.","Answer: 3 Explanation: Option (3) is correct because a mortgagor (i.e., a borrower) who grants a mortgage of real property to a lender retains an interest described as “the equity of redemption”. The equity of redemption protects the borrower’s right to redeem the property upon payment of the mortgage. Option (1) is incorrect because a right of foreclosure arises in favour of a lender where the borrower defaults on the mortgage. Option (2) is incorrect because a mortgage at common law was a conveyance of both title to land and the possession of the land to a lender, not a right retained by the borrower. Option (4) is incorrect because an equitable mortgage refers to a mortgage which is not (and perhaps cannot be) registered on title as a legal mortgage."

(4)still deemed a legal mortgage.","Answer: 2 Explanation: Option (2) is correct because a mortgage that is granted, but for procedural reasons is not registrable, is recognized as an equitable mortgage. Option (1) is ncorrect because this type of mortgage is an equitable mortgage, and is enforceable. Option (3) is incorrect because while a lender should file a caveat to protect its position until the mortgage is in proper registrable form and registered on title, a caveat is not the only protection for an equitable mortgage. An equitable mortgage can also be protected by handing over to the lender the duplicate certificate of title as security for the loan.

The loan has an amortization period of 25 years, a term of 5 years, and calls for monthly payments rounded up to the next higher dollar.

(3)A notice that informs the property owner of the actual value of their property 
(4)A notice of the cost to the property owner of a local improvement project",Answer: 3 Explanation: Option (3) is correct because an assessment notice is a notice informing a property owner of the value of the property as of July 1 of the previous year. Option (1) is incorrect because a separate statement called a “tax notice” is sent to property owners requesting payment of taxes.

(3)A brief appraisal with limited detail may be acceptable if the appraisal is within the client's requested scope of work, and the limitations are explicitly written in the report. 
(4)The appraiser need not know the report’s intended use since the client is the one paying for the report and would know its purpose.",Answer: 4 Explanation: Option (4) is correct because it is false. The appraiser must understand the client’s intended use in order to make the appropriate scope of work decision. Option (1) is incorrect because appraisers do not rely on the client; they use their experience and judgment to establish the information necessary to identify and resolve the problem. Option (2) is incorrect because the appraiser determines the scope of work and level of information necessary to produce a credible appraisal. Option (3) is incorrect because limited detail may be acceptable if it falls within the requested scope of work and limitations are indicated in the report.

The subject property is not adjusted to the comparables nor are the comparables adjusted to each other. Option (1) is incorrect because the correct approach is to determine which comparable is most like the subject property and use that as main evidence for the final market value, not to average the value of the comparable sale prices. Option (2) is incorrect because the comparable properties need not have the same lot size as the subject property.

On the strata plan, the entirety of the building is divided between strata lots and common property. Option (1) is incorrect because a strata plan does not contain the developer’s goals nor does it form part of the disclosure statement. Option (3) is incorrect because cooperative owners possess shares in a non-profit corporation, which in turn holds title to the land. Therefore, there is no need to file a strata plan to divide the property into individual units. Option (4) is incorrect because a strata plan must be filed for any strata development regardless of the number of lots being created."
"Question 136: A lender who is foreclosing may ask the court to appoint a receiver where the property being foreclosed is: 
(1)a large residential apartment building. 
(2)a single-family dwelling with a tenant occupying it. 
(3)a single-family dwelling abandoned by the borrower. 
(4)any one of the above.","Answer: 4 Explanation: Option (4) is correct because Options (1), (2), and (3) all describe situations in which a lender who is foreclosing may ask the court to appoint a receiver. If a mortgaged property has been abandoned (as described in Option (3)) or contains a commercial operation (as described in Options (1) and (2)), the lender may request that the court appoint a receiver to collect the rents, pay the bills, and generally keep the business going."
"Question 137: The “subject of an appraisal” is:

(3)a subjective measure of value by an experienced appraiser. 
(4)the value of the legal rights of ownership vested in a particular piece of real estate.","Answer: 4 Explanation: Option (4) is correct because an appraisal values the legal rights of ownership vested in a particular piece of real estate.

(2)amounts to a trespass. 
(3)interferes with the use and enjoyment of, or causes damage to, the property of another. 
(4)causes physical damage to the person’s own property.","Answer: 3 Explanation: Option (3) is correct because a private nuisance occurs when an owner or occupier of land unreasonably and substantially interferes with the reasonable use and enjoyment of a neighbouring property. Option (1) is incorrect because private nuisance is concerned with the use and enjoyment of property, not the safety or comfort of the public at large. Option (2) is incorrect because an act constituting private nuisance need not involve a trespass (e.g., the wrongful disturbance of an easement may constitute a private nuisance). Option (4) is incorrect because Option (3) is correct."
"Question 139: In British Columbia, before approving a conversion of a rental building to a condominium, the approving authority must consider a number of factors. Which one of the following is NOT a mandatory consideration? 
(1)The priority of rental accommodation over private ownership in the area 
(2)The proposal to relocate existing tenants 
(3)The life expectancy of the building 
(4)The potential increase in real property tax revenue","Answer: 4 Explanation: Option (4) is correct because it is not mandatory to consider the potential increase in real property tax revenue to convert a rental building to a condominium. Options (1), (2), and (3) are all factors the approving authority must consider when deciding whether to approve the conversion."
"Question 140: Which one of the following does NOT result from the immobility of land? 
(1)The need for debt financing 
(2)A vulnerability to outside environmental factors 
(3)An inability to move a listed property to a better resale market 
(4)The necessity for owners to travel in order to take advantage of services provided by different parcels of land","Answer: 1 Explanation: Option (1) is correct because the immobility of land does not affect how a purchase is financed. Options (2), (3), and (4) are incorrect as they result from the immobility of land."

(1)Log 
(2)Concrete block 
(3)Vaulted ceiling 
(4)Post, beam, and plank","Answer: 3 Explanation: Option (3) is correct because a vaulted ceiling is an architectural variation, not a structural method used in housing construction. Options (1), (2), and (4) are incorrect because they describe types of structural methods used in housing construction."
"Question 142: On a straight line principal reduction loan, the monthly payment: 
(1)is a constant amount each month. 
(2)pays interest only. 
(3)pays principal only. 
(4)declines over time.","Answer: 4 Explanation: Option (4) is correct because the monthly payment on a straight line principal reduction loan declines over time. Options (2) and (3) are incorrect because each monthly payment includes a constant amount of the principal, plus the interest that has accrued for the month. Options (1) is incorrect because as the outstanding balance declines over time, the amount of monthly interest declines; therefore, the total payment declines."
"Question 143: Vanessa has agreed to sell her home to Paul for a price of $150,000. Paul has paid a deposit of $15,000 directly to his brokerage.

"Question 146: An investor has the opportunity to invest in one of four alternative mortgages, each with the same degree of risk. The only distinction between these investments is the rate of interest charged to the borrower. These rates are: Loan A: 13.25% per annum, compounded daily Loan B: 13.50% per annum, compounded quarterly.

"Question 147: A local mortgage broker arranged a mortgage in the amount of $210,000. The borrower has agreed to pay a brokerage fee in the amount of $7,200 that is to be added to the loan amount, giving a face value of $217,200 for the loan. The mortgage bears interest at a contract rate of 4.5% per annum, compounded semi-annually. The mortgage has an amortization period and term of 20 years and calls for monthly payments. If the mortgage is sold to an investor for $225,000 immediately after the loan is initiated, the investor will earn the following nominal interest rate, with semi-annual compounding: 
(1)4.083034% 
(2)4.162285%

(1)Former decisions are used as a basis for later decisions. 
(2)The common law system has uniformity. 
(3)Decisions by the Supreme Court of Canada are accorded the most weight in our jurisprudence. 
(4)All of the above result from the doctrine of stare decisis.","Answer: 4 Explanation: Option (4) is correct because the age of the decision does not determine which decision should govern the subsequent decision. Options (1), (2), and (3) each describe a component of the doctrine of stare decisis."
"Question 149: Which of the following statements regarding the income approach of appraisal is TRUE? 
(1)Net operating income is a measure of return on the equity portion of a property’s value. 
(2)Items specific to an owner or investor are included in the calculation of net operating income. 
(3)Net operating income does not consider depreciation, income tax, or debt service. 
(4)The income approach is only used for apartment buildings.","Answer: 3 Explanation: Option (3) is correct because it is true. Option (1) is incorrect because the net operating income represents a return on the entire value of the property; it is not a return only on the equity portion of the property’s value. Option (2) is incorrect because items specific to an owner or investor are NOT included in the calculation of net operating income. Option (4) is incorrect because the income approach can be used in appraising most types of property, although it is more appropriate for properties that produce rental income, e.g., apartment buildings, office buildings, industrial space."
"Question 150: Karen’s neighbour, Jack, is a gas barbecue enthusiast who cooks two meals a day, seven days a week, on his outdoor gas barbecue. As a result, the smoke and fumes are carried onto Karen’s property. The barbecue smoke has discoloured Karen’s dining room curtains and killed her shrubs. Which of the following statements is TRUE? 
(1)Jack may be liable to Karen for private nuisance and Karen may seek an injunction to prevent Jack from continuing the nuisance. 
(2)If Karen chooses to sue Jack for negligence, she must prove that he has breached the duty of care owed to her by a reasonable person in Jack’s situation. 
(3)This scenario reveals a cause of action for interference with the airspace rights of a fee simple owner. 
(4)Karen need not prove that she has suffered any form of damage to succeed in her lawsuit against Jack because her cause of action is considered trespass and “actionable per se” (i.e., without proof of damage).","Answer: 1 Explanation: Option (1) is correct. Karen may have a claim for private nuisance against Jack, as the interference was continuous, the act was done on his land but affected Karen’s land, and it interfered with Karen’s use and enjoyment of her land. An injunction is a possible remedy available under a successful action in private nuisance. Option (2) is false because, if Karen chooses to sue Jack for negligence, she must prove that he has breached the standard of care owed to her by a reasonable person in Jack’s situation, not that he breached the duty of care. Option (3) is false because the interference with airspace rights of a fee simple owner would likely be an action in trespass, and in this case, Jack did not trespass, as the act was done on his land. Option (4) is false because although trespass is actionable per se, Jack did not trespass onto Karen’s property. Trespass requires the direct physical invasion of land by a person or tangible object."
"Question 151: Which of the following is NOT a duty that is owed by a principal to their agent? 
(1)The duty to indemnify the agent 
(2)The duty to remunerate the agent 
(3)The duty to comply with the agency agreement 
(4)The duty to avoid conflicts of interest with the agent","Answer: 4 Explanation: Option (4) is correct because the agent has a duty to avoid conflicts of interest with his or her principal, but the principal does not owe this duty to his or her agent. Options (1), (2), and (3) are incorrect because they are duties that are owed by a principal to his or her agent."
"Question 152: Which one of the following occupiers of real property would NOT be liable, by statute, for the real property taxes? 
(1)The registered owner of a life estate 
(2)The registered holder of a long-term lease, where the lessor is not a tax exempt organization or a public body 
(3)The registered owner of an estate in fee simple 
(4)The registered holder of an agreement for sale","Answer: 2 Explanation: Option (2) is correct because in British Columbia the statutory liability to pay real property taxes is on the owner of the property. This applies even in the context of long term-leases where the lessor is not a tax exempt organization or public body. That said, a lease contract can impose on a lessor a contractual liability to pay property taxes. Option (1), (3), and (4) are incorrect because each of these entities would be statutorily liable for property taxes."
"Question 153: Larry and Theresa orally agree that Theresa will lease 10 acres of farmland owned by Larry for 5 years. As part of the agreement Larry agrees to build a barn, which he does at a cost, to him, of $10,000. Which one of the following statements is TRUE? 
(1)The lease agreement is not enforceable by Larry because it is neither in writing nor signed by Theresa as is required by section 59 of the Law and Equity Act. 
(2)Section 59 of the Law and Equity Act does not apply to lease agreements. 
(3)The lease agreement may be enforceable by Larry because he has altered his position by spending $10,000 on a new barn in reliance on the lease. 
(4)The lease agreement is void because it is not in writing.","Answer: 3 Explanation: Option (3) is correct because Larry may be able to enforce the lease agreement under section 59 of the Law and Equity Act since he has spent $10,000 on a new barn. Generally, contracts respecting land in British Columbia must be in writing to be enforceable, pursuant to section 59 of the Law and Equity Act. However, section 59 allows an exception to this writing requirement in situations where the person seeking to enforce an unwritten contract has changed his or her position such that it would be unfair not to enforce the contract. Option (1) is incorrect because there are exceptions to the writing requirement imposed by section 59. Option (2) is incorrect because section 59 applies to lease agreements for more than 3 years. Option (4) is incorrect because a lease agreement is not automatically void if not in writing (e.g., section 59 does not apply to lease agreements for terms of 3 years or less)."
"Question 154: Which of the following statements is FALSE under the common law of agency? 
(1)An agency relationship is created when two persons agree that one will act on behalf of the other. 
(2)Where the agent does not disclose that they are an agent and enters into a contract with a third party, the principal can have no liability for the contract. 
(3)An agent who would not have capacity to enter a contract themselves may be able to make a valid contract on their principal’s behalf. 
(4)An agency agreement may be either written or oral or partly written and partly oral.","Answer: 2 Explanation: Option (2) is correct because a principal will be bound to a third party by the acts of their agent provided those acts were within the agent’s authority. This means that a principal could be liable to a third party under a contract entered into by their agent where the agent failed to disclose their status as an agent, as long as the agent was acting within their authority. That said, where an agent does not disclose to a third party that he or she is acting as an agent, the agent may also be held liable as a principal. Options (1), (3), and (4) are incorrect because each statement is true of the common law of agency."
"Question 155: There are many reasons why a property might sell for a price that is different from its current appraised value. Which of the following could be a reason? 
(1)The property is in a state of long-term disrepair. 
(2)The property is located beside a fertilizer plant. 
(3)The appraisal was done by the cost approach. 
(4)The property is located next to a school.","Answer: 3 Explanation: Option (3) is the correct answer as the cost approach is most likely to result in an appraisal value that is significantly different from the price a property might sell for. The reason for this is because the replacement cost of a property may not be representative of the value in the market. Options (1), (2), and (4) are incorrect because these factors would likely be accounted for in the appraised value."

(1)the brokerage lists two or more properties for the same seller. 
(2)the seller lists the property with two or more brokerages. 
(3)the seller pays more than one commission. 
(4)the contract requires the listing to be distributed to all members of the real estate board.","Answer: 4 Explanation: Option (4) is correct because a multiple listing agreement is a type of exclusive listing contract which requires that the listing be distributed to all members of the listing licensee’s real estate board. Option (1) is incorrect because the term “multiple” in “multiple listing agreement” does not refer to the number of properties the brokerage lists for the same seller. Options (2) and (3) are incorrect because a multiple listing contract is always an exclusive right to sell, meaning that the property is listed with only one brokerage and the seller pays one commission to that brokerage."
"Question 159: The practice of recognizing expenses as they are incurred, rather than when they are paid for, is a characteristic of which generally accepted accounting principle? 
(1)The cost principle 
(2)The recognition principle 
(3)The matching principle 
(4)The conservation principle","Answer: 3 Explanation: Option (3) is correct because the matching principle states that expenses must be recorded when they are incurred, not when they are paid. Option (1) is incorrect because the cost principle states that assets must be recorded for the purchase price on the date of acquisition. Option (2) is incorrect because the recognition principle is not an accounting principle, although the revenue recognition principle states that revenues must be recorded when they are earned, not when money is received. Option (4) is incorrect because the conservation principle is not a generally accepted accounting principle."
"Question 160: By extending the amortization period of a loan: 
(1)the mortgage loan is paid off faster, which reduces the amount of interest paid by the borrower. 
(2)the size of the required payment will be larger. 
(3)the loan contract period becomes longer and the loan will be classified as a fully amortized loan. 
(4)the repayment of principal is spread over a greater number of payments, making each payment smaller.","Answer: 4 Explanation: Option (4) is incorrect because a longer amortization period will mean that repayment is spread out over a longer period of time, and payments will be smaller. Options (1) is incorrect for this reason. Option (2) is incorrect because the size of the required payment will be smaller. Option (3) is incorrect because extending the loan amortization period does not affect its classification."

(3)Digital signatures are codes built into modems that notify receivers of where a message is coming from. 
(4)Digital signatures are tags in HTML that tell search engines information about a webpage.","Answer: 1 Explanation: Option (1) is correct because digital signatures are codes that are used to authenticate the individual sending the message so as to ensure the integrity of the data. To be effective, digital/e-signatures, such as those used in credit cards, must be unforgeable. Options (2), (3), and (4) are incorrect as they do not describe digital signatures."

(3)The commission only appears on the seller’s statement. 
(4)The commission only appears on the buyer’s statement.","Answer: 3 Explanation: Option (3) is correct because the commission is paid by the seller only.

"Question 164: Which one of the following statements is FALSE?

(3)The Supreme Court of British Columbia may exercise both common law and equitable jurisdiction. 
(4)An appeal by a taxpayer to reduce a tax assessment would fall within the sphere of private law.","Answer: 4 Explanation: Option (4) is correct because tax law falls within the sphere of public law, and is therefore a false statement. Option (1) is incorrect because the doctrine of stare decisis provides uniformity to the common law system by requiring courts to adhere to principles that prior courts have established.

(1)higher value may result through a change of use. 
(2)the existing property should undergo renovation for continued similar use. 
(3)the buyer should have it rezoned.

Given this, the latent value of the property may be realized through a change of use. Option (2) is incorrect because a renovation for continued similar use would not realize the property’s latent value.

(4)A component of a septic waste water system","Answer: 1 Explanation: Option (1) is correct because a dormer is a roof extension that provides extra floor area and windows for the upper level of a home. Options (2), (3), and (4) are incorrect for this reason."
"Question 169: The fact that a joint tenant’s interest does not pass to a personal representative on death is referred to as: 
(1)an estate in inheritance. 
(2)a tenancy in common. 
(3)the right of survivorship. 
(4)a life estate.","Answer: 3 Explanation: Option (3) is correct and Options (1), (2), and (4) are incorrect because the right of survivorship means that when one joint tenant dies, the entire estate automatically vests in the surviving joint tenants."
"Question 170: Meika Jones is being sued for creating a nuisance. Which of the following arguments is a valid defence to the lawsuit? 
(1)The activity involved benefits the public. 
(2)She has not been negligent in carrying out the activity. 
(3)The damage she has created is trifling and of little consequence. 
(4)The activity is authorized by statute but could be carried out without creating a nuisance.",Answer: 3 Explanation: Option (3) is correct because an unreasonable and substantial interference with property is required to establish a claim in nuisance. Trifling and inconsequential damages is insufficient. Option (1) is incorrect because it is no defence to say that the act complained of is beneficial to the public. Option (2) is incorrect because the fact that the activity creating the nuisance has not been performed in a negligent way is no defence to an action in nuisance. Option (4) is incorrect because the mere fact that the activity is authorized by statute does not mean the activity is not a nuisance.

(1)987654321 
(2)R$2c 
(3)83ej9@!h4C 
(4)reale$tate","Answer: 3 Explanation: Option (3) is correct: this password is longer than 8 characters, includes a variety of character types, is not a dictionary word (or combination of dictionary words), and does not include a combination of consecutive keyboard keys. Option (1) is incorrect because it is a sequence of consecutive keyboard combinations. Option (2) incorrect because it is too short. Option (4) is incorrect because it is a combination of dictionary words with an obvious symbol to replace a letter, which can easily be cracked."
"Question 173: Prepayment in a mortgage refers to: 
(1)the right of lenders to demand full repayment of the outstanding principal if the payments fall into arrears. 
(2)the right of the borrower to pay off all (or some) of the outstanding balance during the term of the mortgage. 
(3)the lender’s right to demand full payment of the outstanding balance at the end of the term of a partially amortized mortgage. 
(4)the payment of a finder’s fee to a mortgage broker (as compensation for arranging a mortgage loan), which is made prior to the advancing of mortgage funds.","Answer: 2 Explanation: Option (2) is correct because individual borrowers have the right, under the terms of the Interest Act, to prepay all of the outstanding debt (with additional three months’ interest as a penalty in lieu of notice) at any time after five years from the initiation date of the mortgage. In some instances, mortgage contracts allow for partial or complete prepayment to occur at any point in the contractual term. Options (1), (3), and (4) are incorrect because they do not describe prepayment in a mortgage."
"Question 174: For which one of the following properties would an appraiser be MOST justified in employing the cost approach to determine market value? 
(1)A 40-year-old bungalow that represents the highest and best use 
(2)A newly-constructed church of contemporary design 
(3)A vacant lot that possesses latent value 
(4)A high rise office tower located in an outer suburb","Answer: 2 Explanation: Option (2) is correct. An appraiser who is asked to find the market value of a newly-constructed church would not be able to use the comparative or investment approaches due to the lack of data and would be justified in relying upon the cost approach. In addition, the appraiser can effectively determine the cost of constructing the improvements since the church is newly constructed and has not experienced any depreciation. Option (1) is incorrect because a 40-year old bungalow should be appraised using the direct comparison approach, Option (3) is incorrect because a vacant lot with latent value should be appraised using the residual method. Option (4) is incorrect because a high rise office tower in an outer suburb should be appraised using the income approach."
"Question 175: Which of the following statements regarding profits à prendre is TRUE? 
(1)A profit à prendre must accompany a dominant tenement. 
(2)The right to fish on another’s land is an example of a profit à prendre. 
(3)A profit à prendre is always granted for a definite period of time. 
(4)An owner who wishes to impose restrictions consistent with a general scheme of development would likely charge the land with a profit à prendre.","Answer: 2 Explanation: Option (2) is correct because a profit à prendre is a right to enter onto the land of another person and to take some profit from the land, such as profits from fishing. Options (1) and (3) are incorrect because unlike easements, profits à prendre need not accompany a dominant tenement. They also need not be granted for an indefinite period of time. Option (4) is incorrect because an owner who wishes to impose restrictions consistent with a general scheme of development would likely charge the land with a building scheme."
"Question 176: A commercial “periodic” tenancy is: 
(1)a term lease. 
(2)a lease for a certain period of time. 
(3)a tenancy that automatically renews itself on the last day of the term for a further term of the same length until it is terminated by either party upon proper notice. 
(4)a tenancy that is created in a commercial context after the entering of the lease and prior to the entering of possession by the tenant.","Answer: 3 Explanation: Option (3) is correct because a periodic tenancy automatically renews itself on the last day of the term for a further term of the same duration until terminated by either party. Options (1), (2), and (4) are incorrect because these statements do not describe features of periodic tenancies."
"Question 177: Victor is selling his house to Paula with an adjustment date and a possession date of August 16, and a completion date of August 14. He is concerned about the fact that he just filled his oil tank. Which one of the following is TRUE? 
(1)The conveyancer will give Victor a debit on the statement of adjustments for the oil in the tank. 
(2)Victor will lose the cost of his oil. He should not have filled the tank. 
(3)Victor could arrange to have a reading done on the adjustment date and make an adjustment privately with Paula for the cost of the oil remaining in the tank on that date. 
(4)The cost of oil remaining in the tank must be calculated as at the completion date and Paula must reimburse Victor for that amount.","Answer: 3 Explanation: Option (3) is correct because oil left in the storage tank is an item usually settled between the parties outside of the statements of adjustments. Options (1), (2), and (4) are incorrect for the same reason."
"Question 178: Lenders who are attempting to ration mortgage funds could: 
(1)decrease their gross debt service ratio. 
(2)decrease their interest rate on mortgage loans. 
(3)increase their maximum loan-to-value ratio. 
(4)increase the maximum amortization period available on mortgage loans.","Answer: 1 Explanation: Option (1) is correct because rationing mortgage funds means to reduce the amount given out to mortgage loans. By reducing the gross debt service ratio (PIT/Gross Income), the lender decreases the amount of the loan for a given gross income. Option (2) is incorrect because decreasing their interest rates doesn’t decrease the amount lent out; it just creates a greater demand for loans. Option (3) is incorrect because increasing the maximum loan to-value ratio means for a given market value of the property, the lender is willing to advance a greater amount of a loan. Option (4) is incorrect because increasing the maximum amortization period, all other factors constant, means the present value of the loans will decrease, since borrowers are given more time to pay off the loan."
"Question 179: With fully amortized constant payment mortgages, when payments are rounded up to the next higher cent, the final payment necessary to repay the loan amount will be: 
(1)smaller than the regular payments. 
(2)larger than the regular payments. 
(3)the same as the regular payments. 
(4)impossible to determine.","Answer: 1 Explanation: Option (1) is correct because if the payment is rounded up to the next higher cent, the final payment of a fully amortized mortgage will be smaller than regular payments, because the borrower is “overpaying” a slight amount each period. Options (2), (3), and (4) are incorrect for this reason."
"Question 180: A brokerage must maintain at least one account in a bank, trust company, or credit union designated as a trust account into which the brokerage must put, upon receipt, all monies received for or on behalf of a client. The Real Estate Services Act only permits the brokerage to withdraw money from such an account under certain circumstances. Which one of the following is NOT one of them? 
(1)Money paid to or in accordance with the instructions of the principal to whose credit the money was deposited 
(2)Money intended as remuneration for a licensee and that has been earned in accordance with the Rules 
(3)Money paid into the trust account by mistake 
(4)Money required for payment of a brokerage’s business expenses","Answer: 4 Explanation: Option (4) is correct because a brokerage is not permitted to withdraw money from the trust account to pay business expenses. Options (1), (2), and (3) are incorrect because the Real Estate Services Act allows a brokerage to withdraw money from the trust account in those circumstances."
"Question 181: You have a partially completed appraisal report that you need to fill in. The 2,600 square foot subject property has 4 bathrooms. The house next door is similar in all respects except for the number of bathrooms and square footage. It sold for $234,000 and was adjusted +$5,700 for bathrooms and –$10,000 for square footage. If the market value of a bathroom is $5,700 and above a 1,900 sq. ft. benchmark, each 100 sq. ft. is worth $5,000, it can be concluded that this comparable has: 
(1)3 bathrooms and 2,800 square feet. 
(2)5 bathrooms and 2,400 square feet. 
(3)4 bathrooms and 2,400 square feet. 
(4)3 bathrooms and 2,600 square feet.","Answer: 1 Explanation: Option (1) is correct because in relation to the subject property, this comparable has three bathrooms (one less bathroom) and 2,800 square feet. The square footage adjustment is -$10,000; therefore, since the square footage adjustment is $5,000 per 100 square feet, there is a 200 square foot difference between the comparable and the subject. Since the adjustment is negative, the comparable property is larger (by 200 square feet) than the subject (2,600 + 200). Options (2), (3), and (4) are therefore incorrect."
"Question 182: An option to purchase the mortgaged property given by the borrower to the lender at the time the mortgage is negotiated is: 
(1)enforceable if the borrower has independent legal advice. 
(2)void. 
(3)enforceable in all cases. 
(4)a collateral advantage.","Answer: 2 Explanation: Option (2) is correct and Options (1), (3), and (4) are incorrect because an option to purchase the property provided by the borrower to the lender is considered a clog on the equity of redemption, and is void."
"Question 183: A mortgage contract with a face value of $170,000 requires monthly payments of $1,117.12 over a 20-year period. However, the mortgage broker advances only $166,000 after deducting a commission of $2,500, legal fees of $1,000, and an appraisal fee of $500.

"Question 184: After an order nisi of foreclosure is granted to a petitioner and the respondent borrower fails to pay the amount due as required by the order, the petitioner may apply for: 
(1)an order absolute of foreclosure. 
(2)a judicial sale. 
(3)an equitable charging order. 
(4)either (1) or (2).",Answer: 4 Explanation: Option (4) is correct because the petitioner may apply for either an absolute of foreclosure or a judicial sale after an order nisi is granted and the respondent borrower fails to pay the amount due as required by the order. Options (1) and (2) are incorrect for the same reason. Option (3) is incorrect because an equitable charging order is not an option for petitioners to apply for after the respondent borrower fails to pay the amount due as required by an order nisi.
"Question 185: Which one of the following is NOT a rationale for government regulation of land use? 
(1)Protection of property values 
(2)Public health and safety 
(3)Limiting the power of land developers 
(4)Conservation of natural resources","Answer: 3 Explanation: Option (3) is correct because limiting the power of land developers is not a rationale for government regulation of land use. Options (1), (2), and (4) are correct because they are all rationales for government regulation of land use."
"Question 186: What will be the maximum loan granted on a commercial building with a lending value of $3,500,000 and yielding a net operating income of $360,000 per year, where the lender requires a debt coverage ratio of 1.25 and an 80% loan-to-value ratio? The loan will be amortized over 20 years with annual payments and the interest rate is 7.5% per annum, compounded annually. Round your answer to the nearest $1,000. 
(1)$2,936,000 
(2)$2,800,000 
(3)$3,036,000 
(4)$2,590,000","Answer: 2 Explanation: The maximum loan granted will be the lower amount of the loan-to-value constraint and the DCR constraint. Using DCR constraint, calculate maximum allowable payments."
"Question 187: Which one of the following statements is correct? 
(1)Contracts of purchase and sale can always be assigned. 
(2)Contracts of purchase and sale can never be assigned. 
(3)Contracts of purchase and sale can only be assigned with the permission of the buyer in writing. 
(4)Contracts of purchase and sale can be assigned if the contract includes the standard assignment terms, the assignment does not prejudice the seller, and the contract does not prohibit assignment.","Answer: 4 Explanation: Option (4) is correct because section 8.2 of the Real Estate Services Act requires licensees to include the standard assignment terms in the contract of purchase and sale (unless they have been advised otherwise by their client). If the requirements of section 8.2 are met, assignments are permissible provided that they do not prejudice the rights of the seller and the contract does not prohibit assignment. Option (1) is incorrect because contracts of purchase and sale can only be assigned if certain conditions are met. Option (2) is incorrect because contracts of purchase and sale can be assigned in some circumstances. Option (3) is incorrect because under the standard assignment terms, contracts of purchase and sale can be assigned with the written consent of the seller, not the buyer."
"Question 188: With respect to an insured mortgage loan, which one of the following statements is FALSE? 
(1)Default insurance is paid for by the borrower. 
(2)The borrower can add the premium to the mortgage amount. 
(3)If the borrower defaults, the insurance company will guarantee that the lender will recover all capital invested. 
(4)The lender has only the personal covenant of the borrower and the value of the property for security.","Answer: 4 Explanation: Option (4) is correct because it is false. With an insured mortgage loan, the lender has not only the borrower’s personal covenant, but also the insurance as fallback security in the case the borrower defaults on payments. Options (1), (2), and (3) are true statements and are therefore incorrect."
"Question 189: A seller is willing to sell his house, by way of a take-back mortgage, for $90,000.

"Question 190: A person whom an agent represents is known in law as the: 
(1)buyer. 
(2)principal. 
(3)client. 
(4)seller.","Answer: 2 Explanation: Option (2) is correct because the principal is the person for whom an agent has contracted to act for, and for whose benefit the agent is required to perform and make decisions. Options (1) and (4) are incorrect because while an agent may represent a buyer or seller, the question is asking for the general term for the person that an agent represents, regardless of the side of the transaction. Option (3) is incorrect because “client” is not the legal term for the person whom an agent represents."
"Question 191: In applying the income approach, depreciation is excluded from operating expenses in the calculation of net operating income. Which one of the following statements is an explanation for why depreciation is excluded? 
(1)Depreciation measures a loss in value that occurs despite regular repairs and maintenance. 
(2)Depreciation affects only the building component of the property. 
(3)Depreciation expense is excluded from calculations for income tax purposes. 
(4)The life of a building is primarily determined by economic factors rather than physical condition.","Answer: 4 Explanation: Option (4) is correct because depreciation is excluded in net operating income calculations because the life of a building depends on its economic durability, not its physical durability. The economic life of many buildings is so long that the amount of depreciation taken each year is not an important element in the estimation of value. Option (1), (2), and (3) are incorrect because they do not describe reasons for excluding depreciation from net operating income."
"Question 192: If a property owner considers that the actual value assessment of their property is too high, they must first submit their complaint to: 
(1)a Property Assessment Review Panel. 
(2)the Board of Variance. 
(3)the Municipal Finance Authority. 
(4)the Property Assessment Appeal Board.","Answer: 1 Explanation: Option (1) is the correct answer. A Property Assessment Review Panel is the first level of appeal from a property assessment. Option (2) is incorrect because the Board of Variance deals with exceptions to zoning bylaws. Option (3) is incorrect because the Municipal Finance Authority levies property tax, but does not deal with assessments. Option (4) is incorrect because the Property Assessment Appeal Board is the second level of appeal (i.e., it hears appeals from the Property Assessment Review Panel)."
"Question 193: Which one of the following is NOT essential in order to constitute a restrictive covenant in law? 
(1)It must be positive in nature. 
(2)It must be negative in nature. 
(3)At least two parcels of property must be involved. 
(4)The burden of the restriction must have been intended by the parties to bind the land.","Answer: 1 Explanation: Option (1) is correct because a restrictive covenant must be negative, not positive. Options (2), (3), and (4) are incorrect because being negative in nature, involving two parcels of property and having intention to bind the land are all essential elements of a restrictive covenant."
"Question 194: If payments are rounded up to the next higher dollar, the MOST likely result is: 
(1)an increase in the cost to the borrower. 
(2)a higher yield to the lender. 
(3)a lower final payment. 
(4)an increase in the number of payments.","Answer: 3 Explanation: Option (3) is correct because if payments are rounded up to the next higher dollar, the final payment will likely be smaller because the borrower is “overpaying” a small amount each period. Options (1) and (2) are incorrect because rounding will not increase the cost to the borrower or the yield to the lender. Option (4) is incorrect because the number of payments will remain the same."
"Question 195: There are two ways to surrender a lease under a commercial tenancy. One is by an act of the parties; the other is: 
(1)by operation of law. 
(2)by the order of an arbitrator. 
(3)by the order of the Public Trustee. 
(4)by an order of the Residential Tenancy Board.","Answer: 1 Explanation: Option (1) is correct because surrender of a commercial lease can arise by operation of law where the landlord does some act which is inconsistent with the continuation of the tenancy. Options (2), (3), and (4) are incorrect because an arbitrator, Public Trustee and the Residential Tenancy Board cannot grant orders amounting to surrender of a commercial lease."
"Question 196: A potential buyer is aware of the asking price for a particular house listed for sale. Which of the following statements is normally FALSE? 
(1)The probable sale price will be equal to or above the floor price. 
(2)The probable sale price will be equal to or above the seller’s “value to owner”. 
(3)The ceiling price will be equal to or below the asking price. 
(4)The seller is likely to know the buyer’s ceiling price.","Answer: 4 Explanation: Option (4) is the false statement as it is unlikely that the seller knows the buyer’s ceiling price. Options (1), (2), and (3) are all true statements."

"Question 198: At the end of a profitable year, a business’s ownership has decided to leave all these profits in the business. Which one of the following BEST describes the effect that profitable operations have on the balance sheet of a business? 
(1)Owner’s equity is increased 
(2)Assets are increased 
(3)Cash is increased 
(4)Liabilities are decreased","Answer: 1 Explanation: Option (1) is correct because When a company generates a profit (positive net income), the result is an increase in the owner’s or shareholder’s equity. Option (2) is incorrect because assets may increase or decrease depending on the company’s cash flow and asset purchase/sale activity. Option (3) is incorrect because cash may increase or decrease depending on the company’s cash flow activities. Option (4) is incorrect because liabilities may increase or decrease depending on the company’s borrowing and repayment activities."
"Question 199: John makes the following offer to Mary. “I will pay you $500 to put a new rose bed in my garden.” If Mary accepts, what is the result? 
(1)There is no contract because there is no consideration. 
(2)The promise to pay is past consideration and therefore no contract exists. 
(3)An enforceable contract has been formed if an intention to create a legal relationship exists. 
(4)There is no contract because the contract is not in writing.","Answer: 3 Explanation: Option (3) is correct because assuming John and Mary intend to enter into a legal relationship, the other essentials of a contract are met – offer, acceptance, and consideration. There is no evidence that one of the parties lacks capacity or is lacking genuine consent. Option (1) is incorrect because $500 is valid consideration. Option (2) is incorrect because the promise to pay is future consideration, not past, as Mary does not yet have the money. Option (4) is incorrect because the contract is not required to be in writing."
"Question 200: Under the Environmental Management Act, a mortgage lender may be liable for the remediation of a contaminated site if the lender: 
(1)participates only in purely financial matters related to the site. 
(2)insists on environmental conditions within a security agreement. 
(3)becomes the registered owner of the site. 
(4)appoints a person to inspect a contaminated site to determine future actions to take.","Answer: 3 Explanation: Option (3) is correct because a mortgage lender may attract liability for remediation of a contaminated site if they become the registered owner of the property, for example, as the result of foreclosure. Options (1), (2), and (4) are incorrect because the Environmental Management Act specifically provides that a lender is not liable if they participate only in financial matters, impose requirements that will not cause or increase contamination, or appoint a person to investigate the site."
"Question 201: When a contract is executed under seal, the seal: 
(1)constitutes a written acceptance. 
(2)takes the place of the signature of the offeror and offeree. 
(3)stands in the place of consideration. 
(4)represents intention.","Answer: 3 Explanation: Option (3) is correct because if a contract is executed under seal, the contract will be binding even if no consideration has been given. Option (1) is incorrect because the contract must also be accepted. Option (2) is incorrect because the contract may still need to be signed. Option (4) is incorrect because the seal itself does not show intention, as it is possible that the parties may not know of the legal effects of a seal."
"Question 202: Two identical houses located next to one another in the same neighbourhood sell within one week of each other. Ms. Brown sells hers for $112,000, while Mr. Fisher is only able to sell his for $100,000. Which of the following could account for the difference in selling price? 
(1)The listing brokerage representing Ms. Brown spent an extraordinary amount of money on advertising her property. 
(2)Mr. Fisher supplied a vendor take-back mortgage at 9% while the current market rates were 12%. 
(3)Ms. Brown was promoted to a new position in Edmonton and her expertise was required immediately. 
(4)All of the above factors could account for the difference in selling price.",Answer: 1 Explanation: Option (1) is correct because increased advertising on a particular property will result in more potential buyers that may result in a higher sale price. Option (2) is incorrect because Mr. Fisher is providing beneficial below-market financing that should increase the value of the property and mortgage for sale. Option (3) is incorrect because Ms. Brown’s motivation to sell her home quickly would be more likely to result in a quick sale for a lower price. Option (4) is incorrect because Options (2) and (3) are incorrect.
"Question 203: Which financial institution is currently the largest single source of institutional mortgage funds in Canada? 
(1)Credit unions 
(2)Life insurance companies 
(3)Trust and loan companies

"Question 204: Which of the following lenders are impacted by the stress test borrower qualification rule for uninsured mortgages implemented in January 2018? 
(1)Chartered banks 
(2)Trust companies 
(3)Federally regulated financial institutions

Options (1), (2), and (3) are incorrect as they do not describe all of the impacted lenders."
"Question 205: A voidable contract is: 
(1)one that never existed at all, even if the parties want it to exist. 
(2)a contract that one or both of the parties can cancel. 
(3)unenforceable. 
(4)the result of a void deed.","Answer: 2 Explanation: Option (2) is correct because a voidable contract is one which one of the parties has the option to rescind (meaning cancel) the contract. Option (1) is incorrect because this definition describes a void contract. Option (3) is incorrect because a voidable contract can still be enforceable. If the party with the option to cancel chooses not to cancel the contract, they can enforce it against the other party. Option (4) is incorrect because a deed is a document used to transfer an interest in land, not a contract."

(3)A fee simple interest in the strata lot, and a fee simple interest in the common property as a tenant in common with the other strata lot owners

(3)Sole proprietorships, partnerships, and corporations are identical in terms of taxation of owner’s income. 
(4)A sole proprietorship is a business enterprise owned by a group of individuals.",Answer: 2 Explanation: Option (2) is correct because both sole proprietors and partners need to report their business income on their personal income tax returns. Option (1) is incorrect because it excludes partners from this requirement.

(1)Legal mortgages, but not equitable mortgages, are guaranteed by the principle of indefeasibility in British Columbia. 
(2)The principle of indefeasibility provides that, where a buyer deals with a registered chargeholder, the buyer will acquire good title. 
(3)In British Columbia there are a number of exceptions to the principle of indefeasibility. 
(4)The principle of indefeasibility is consistent with the common law doctrine of the void deed.","Answer: 3 Explanation: Option (3) is correct because section 23 of the Land Title Act contains 10 exceptions to the principle of indefeasibility. Option (1) is incorrect because neither legal nor equitable charges are guaranteed by the principle of indefeasibility. Option (2) is incorrect because the principle of indefeasibility only provides that a good-faith purchaser can rely completely on the ownership shown on the certificate of title, and can acquire good title upon registration, even though there are defects in the vendor’s registered title.

"Question 217: Kent rented his Kerrisdale house to Lisa for a fixed term of three years commencing July 1, 2008 and terminating on June 30, 2011 for an annual rent of $12,000 payable in equal monthly instalments on the first day of each month. On April 12, 2010, Lisa abandoned the premises without giving notice to Kent and without paying the rent for April. The BC Residential Tenancy Act requires Kent to do which of the following? 
(1)Hire a bailiff to distrain Lisa’s goods left on the premises to compensate Kent for the rent in arrears 
(2)Limit his claim against Lisa for arrears of rent to the amount of the security deposit provided by her 
(3)Attempt to re-rent the premises and mitigate his damages 
(4)Sue Lisa for the rent due for the remaining term of the lease without any obligation for Kent to account to Lisa for the security deposit and accrued interest","Answer: 3 Explanation: Option (3) is correct because section 7(2) of the Residential Tenancy Act imposes a duty on residential landlords to mitigate their damages that results from the tenant’s breach of the tenancy agreement. For example, if a tenant wrongfully vacates the premises prior to the expiry of a fixed term residential tenancy agreement (as occurred with Lisa in this question), the landlord must still attempt to re-rent the premises at a reasonably economic rent. Option (1) is incorrect because section 26(3) of the Residential Tenancy Act effectively abolishes the remedy of distress in residential tenancies. Option (2) is incorrect because the Residential Tenancy Act does not limit claims for arrears of rent. The amount claimed for arrears of rent is only limited by the duty to mitigate damages required of the landlord. Option (4) is incorrect because the Residential Tenancy Act does not require the landlord to sue the tenant."

(3)If the taxes are not yet due, no adjustment is made until the tax bill arrives. 
(4)All of the above are correct.","Answer: 1 Explanation: Option (1) is correct because the seller has already paid all of the taxes for the current year and needs to be refunded the amount proportional to the time that the seller is no longer living in the property. Option (2) is incorrect because the seller is responsible for the full amount of any penalty. It is not adjusted because only the seller is liable to pay the taxes and failed to do so in a timely manner.

"Question 220: Which of the following would NOT be included in a statement of profit and loss? 
(1)Depreciation 
(2)Rental revenue 
(3)Current liabilities

Option (1) is incorrect because retained earnings is an equity account on a corporation’s balance sheet. Option (2) is incorrect because the net income is equal to taxable income, plus depreciation expense, less capital cost allowance.

(2)It is a listing of the revenue and expenses of a business enterprise. 
(3)It may include depreciation, revenue, and cost of goods sold. 
(4)It is always determined on an annual basis.","Answer: 4 Explanation: Option (4) is correct because an income statement is not always determined on an annual basis.

(2)Reasonable grounds to suspect 
(3)Belief beyond a reasonable doubt 
(4)A simple suspicion","Answer: 2 Explanation: Option (2) is correct because the required threshold to submit a Suspicious Transaction Report (STR) to FINTRAC is reasonable grounds to suspect. Option (1) is incorrect because reasonable grounds to believe means that there are verified facts supporting a probability that an offence has occurred, and is a higher threshold than reasonable grounds to suspect. Option (3) is incorrect because it is the standard that needs to be met to secure a criminal conviction, and it is higher than reasonable grounds to suspect.

(3)all strata lots are lumped together. 
(4)the common property of a strata corporation is excluded altogether.","Answer: 2 Explanation: Option (2) is correct and Options (1), (3), (4) are incorrect because each strata lot, together with the strata lot owner’s share in the common property, is deemed to be a separate parcel of land and is assessed and taxed individually.

"Question 242: In a particular real estate transaction, taxes for the current year, in the amount of $516, were paid by the seller on July 1. The adjustment, possession, and completion date is July 28. Where would the tax adjustment appear on the statements of adjustments? 
(1)As a credit on the buyer’s statement and a debit on the seller’s statement 
(2)As a credit on the seller’s statement and a debit on the buyer’s statement 
(3)As a credit on both statements 
(4)As a debit on both statements","Answer: 2 Explanation: Option (2) is correct because when taxes are previously paid by the seller, the buyer should reimburse the seller for the portion of the year from the adjustment date onward. The reimbursement will appear as a credit on the seller’s statement and a debit on the buyer’s statement. Options (1), (3), and (4) are incorrect for this reason."
"Question 243: A property is sold for $175,000. Real estate commission is 5% on the first $100,000 and 2.5% on the balance of the sale price. The adjustment, possession, and completion date is July 28. Taxes for the current year, in the amount of $516, were paid by the seller on July 1. The buyer has paid a $20,000 deposit to her brokerage. The legal fees for the conveyance amount to $384. No exemptions apply to this transaction, so property transfer tax is payable upon completion. It is NOT a leap year. As well, the buyer is NOT a foreign entity for property transfer tax purposes. The required balance due to complete from the buyer will be:

(1)$221.95 
(2)$294.05 
(3)$240.54 
(4)$282.45","Answer: 1 Explanation: Option (1) is correct because when taxes are previously paid by the seller, the buyer should reimburse the seller for the portion of the year from the adjustment date onward. The buyer’s share of the year’s property taxes (Jul. 28 to Dec. 31 = 157 days) is calculated in the following manner: 157/365 × $516 = $221.95. This amount will appear as a credit on the seller’s statement and a debit on the buyer’s statement of adjustments. Options (2), (3), and (4) are therefore incorrect."

"Question 246: Which of the following statements is TRUE regarding professional ethics? 
(1)Professional ethics standards are the same as the legal requirements for a licensee. 
(2)Licensees have a professional duty to hold other licensees to the highest professional and ethical standards. 
(3)None of the duties owed to clients under the Real Estate Services Rules are also fiduciary duties. 
(4)Professional ethics only apply to the relationship between a licensee and their client.","Answer: 2 Explanation: Option (2) is correct because licensees have a duty to maintain the integrity of the real estate profession, including holding others in the profession to the highest standards. Option (1) is incorrect because ethical standards are not the same as the legal requirements for a licensee. Professional ethics standards are often higher standards compared to legislative standards. Option (3) is incorrect because the duties of full disclosure, confidentiality, acting in accordance with lawful instruction, and acting in a client’s best interests are all duties under the Rules and fiduciary duties. Option (4) is incorrect because professional ethics apply when dealing with clients, non-clients, and other real estate professionals."
"Question 247: You have a partially completed appraisal report that you need to fill in. The 2,000 square foot subject property has 4 bathrooms. The house next door is similar in all respects except for the number of bathrooms and square footage. The 2,100 square foot comparable sold for $326,500 and has 3 bathrooms. If the market value of a bathroom is $2,700 and above an 1,800 sq. ft. benchmark, each 100 sq. ft. is worth $5,000, this comparable will have to be adjusted for bathrooms and square footage by: 
(1)–$2,700 and +$5,000 respectively. 
(2)+$5,000 and –$2,700 respectively. 
(3)+$2,700 and –$5,000 respectively. 
(4)+$5,400 and +$2,700 respectively.","Answer: 3 Explanation: Option (3) is correct because the comparable will need an adjustment of +$2,700 for 1 bathroom since the subject has one more bathroom than the comparable. In addition, there is a - $5,000 adjustment for the 100 square foot difference in size because the subject is smaller than the comparable. Options (1), (2), and (4) are therefore incorrect."
"Question 248: In the shopping behaviour model, which of the following is NOT a main classification? 
(1)Specialty goods 
(2)Superior goods 
(3)Shopping goods 
(4)Convenience goods","Answer: 2 Explanation: Option (2) is correct because the shopping behaviour model classifies products and services based on the amount of effort that a consumer is willing to go through to obtain that product or service. There is no superior goods classification. Options (1), (3), and (4) are incorrect because this classification system includes convenience goods, shopping goods, specialty goods, and unsought goods."

"Question 251: Any clause contained in a mortgage that clogs the equity of redemption is: 
(1)valid. 
(2)void. 
(3)illegal. 
(4)an unreasonable restraint of trade.","Answer: 2 Explanation: Option (2) is correct because of an implied term required in mortgage law that, upon full repayment of the loan, a borrower has the right to have title reconveyed to him or her in the same state as it was at the time of the making of the mortgage (usually this means title will be free and clear of all encumbrances). Any term which seeks to provide otherwise is considered to be a “clog on the equity of redemption” and will be of no effect, or void. Option (1) is incorrect because any term which is void cannot be valid. Option (3) is incorrect because a term which purports to clog the equity of redemption is not considered to be illegal; rather, it will simply not be enforced by the courts. Option (4) is incorrect because it confuses a clog on the equity of redemption with a stipulation for a collateral advantage. Problems related to collateral advantages are no longer considered a clog on the equity of redemption and are instead debated in terms of unreasonable restraints of trade."
"Question 252: In which of the following situations would bridge financing be the MOST advantageous form of financing for Jonathan? 
(1)Jonathan and his wife recently had a second child and are looking to purchase a larger home. Jonathan and his wife have found the perfect home in North Vancouver but their current home has not yet sold, and they need money for a down payment. 
(2)Jonathan is a first time home buyer looking to buy a townhouse near Burnaby. 
(3)Jonathan has recently retired and is looking for a way to use the equity in his home to finance the purchase of a recreational vehicle. 
(4)Jonathan’s children have moved out of the house and Jonathan wants to downsize to a smaller home that he can finance completely from his savings.","Answer: 1 Explanation: Option (1) is correct because bridge financing is a type of interim financing whereby a borrower will receive a loan and grant a mortgage to a lender for a short period while long-term financing is being pursued. Bridge financing can be used where a borrower has purchased property but has not sold his or her existing property and financing to purchase the new property is required. Option (2) is incorrect as a conventional mortgage would be the most effective financing option for Jonathan in this situation. Option (3) is incorrect as a reverse annuity mortgage would best allow Jonathan to access the equity in his home to make a purchase. Option (4) is incorrect as it would not require any financing, since Jonathan wants to pay completely from his savings."
"Question 253: In applying the cost approach to the valuation of a single-family residence built in 1954, the value of improvements is determined by: 
(1)the actual construction costs, or if unavailable, historic construction cost data. 
(2)the current costs of constructing a modern equivalent of the subject property. 
(3)the current costs of constructing an exact replica of the property being appraised. 
(4)the construction costs for a builder of average efficiency measured in 1954 standards.","Answer: 2 Explanation: Option (2) is correct because when using the cost approach of appraisal, cost of the improvements is normally determined by utilizing the current replacement cost. Replacement cost is the cost of providing a building that would represent the modern equivalent of the house to be appraised in determining the construction cost of a building. Options (1), (3), and (4) are incorrect for this reason."
"Question 254: Consider a building for which a strata plan was filed in August of 2011. In the event that the building is destroyed and the strata corporation passes a resolution not to rebuild, how will the proceeds of any insurance policy be distributed? 
(1)Equally between all owners 
(2)According to the unit entitlement of the individual strata lot owners 
(3)According to the value each strata lot bears to the total value of all lots (values determined at the inception of the project) 
(4)According to a conversion schedule based upon the most recent assessed values of the strata lots","Answer: 4 Explanation: Option (4) is correct because the Strata Property Act applies to strata plans deposited on or after July 1, 2000, replacing the Schedule of Interest on Destruction which was used under previous legislation. Section 273 and 278 of the Act provide for a “conversion schedule” or “interest schedule” that will be employed to determine the distribution of the proceeds in the event that a strata complex is destroyed and the owners decide to take the insurance money instead of rebuilding. Option (1) is incorrect because the value of each strata lot is different and therefore it would be unfair to distribute insurance policy proceeds equally between all owners. Options (2) and (3) are incorrect because they are based on unit entitlement, which is similar to the Schedule of Interest on Destruction, which is only used for strata plans deposited prior to July 1, 2000."
"Question 255: Under which one of the following conditions is the comparative approach of appraisal MOST applicable? 
(1)Where the volume of sales transactions is very low 
(2)Where buyers and sellers are well informed about current sales transactions 
(3)Where the property has redevelopment potential 
(4)Where the property is unique","Answer: 2 Explanation: Option (2) is correct because the comparative approach of appraisal is most appropriate where buyers and sellers are well informed about current sales transactions. Options (1) and (3) are incorrect because the comparative approach of appraisal is applicable when there is sufficient recent sales data of similar properties, and the property does not have redevelopment potential. Option (4) is incorrect because under the comparative approach, a property’s value should not exceed the cost of purchasing an alternative property that can provide similar utility. Therefore, it may not be appropriate if a property is unique."
"Question 256: In a scenario where a licensee is directly or indirectly acquiring an interest in real estate and has complied strictly with the disclosure requirements of the Real Estate Services Rules, which of the following statements is TRUE? 
(1)No conflict of interest and duty could exist. 
(2)The common law may still require further disclosure. 
(3)They may make a secret profit. 
(4)They are safe from any sort of liability arising from that purchase.","Answer: 2 Explanation: Option (2) is correct because, although the Real Estate Services Act outlines certain disclosure requirements in Section 5-10, the common law considers an agent’s duties and responsibilities to the principal to be one of a fiduciary nature and requires a duty of loyalty, which includes both confidentiality and FULL disclosure, above and beyond what is required in Section 5-10. Options (1) and (4) are incorrect because the common law may extend a licensee’s disclosure responsibilities beyond the duty to disclose laid out in Section 5-10. Option (3) is incorrect because making a secret profit would violate the duty of utmost loyalty and full disclosure."
"Question 257: Whose responsibility is it under the Assessment Act to establish actual value? 
(1)The local municipal council 
(2)The British Columbia Financial Services Authority 
(3)The Lieutenant-Governor in Council 
(4)The Assessor","Answer: 4 Explanation: Option (4) is correct because the assessor’s primary purpose under the Assessment Act is to provide actual values on which to apply tax levies. Option (1) is incorrect because the municipal council sets the general tax rate for each class of property in a given territory, but does not determine the actual value of the property. Option (2) is incorrect because the British Columbia Financial Services Authority does not establish actual value of property. Option (3) is incorrect because the Lieutenant-Governor in Council appoints the Property Assessment Appeal board, but is not involved in assessing the actual value of a piece of property."
"Question 258: Which of the following is NOT a characteristic of a mortgage as an investment? 
(1)Illiquid relative to government bonds 
(2)Requires a high degree of administrative work 
(3)Requires a high initial outlay of capital 
(4)Has short repayment terms and amortization periods","Answer: 4 Explanation: Option (4) is the correct answer as a mortgage typically has long terms and amortization periods. Option (1) is incorrect because mortgages do not trade publicly such as bonds and stocks, making them relatively illiquid. Options (2) and (3) are incorrect because mortgage loans also require a high degree of administrative work, and a relatively high initial outlay of capital compared to other investments."
"Question 259: Where two neighbouring landowners contract to prevent one of them from putting their land to a certain use, they are said to have created: 
(1)a licence. 
(2)a limiting caveat. 
(3)a restrictive covenant. 
(4)an easement.","Answer: 3 Explanation: Option (3) is correct because a restrictive covenant is an interest in land which imposes a restriction on the use of one person’s land (the servient tenement) for the benefit of another piece of land (the dominant tenement). Option (1) is incorrect because a licence creates a positive right, not a restriction. Option (2) is incorrect because a caveat is a notice registered against the title to land warning those searching the registrar that someone is claiming an estate or interest in land against the title. Option (4) is incorrect because an easement gives the holder a positive right to use the neighbouring land for his benefit, whereas a restrictive covenant prevents the neighbouring land from being used in a particular way."
"Question 260: Which of the following is a valid mandatory component of the strata plan that a developer must deposit at the land title office to create a strata development? 
(1)Drawings that show the designated street address of each strata lot 
(2)A Schedule of Unit Entitlement 
(3)A copy of the Standard Rules for the strata corporation 
(4)The area of each strata lot indicated in square feet","Answer: 2 Explanation: Option (2) is correct because every strata plan must include a Schedule of Unit Entitlement. Option (1) is incorrect because the required drawings must show the strata lots distinguished by number or letter in consecutive order, but they are not necessarily required to show the street address of each strata lot. Option (3) is incorrect because there are no Standard Rules provided in legislation, and there is no requirement for a strata corporation to create Rules. Rather, there is only a requirement for there to be bylaws in place when the strata plan is filed. Option (4) is incorrect because the area of each strata lot must be indicated in square metres, not square feet."
"Question 261: Which one of the following is the BEST reason for an investor to choose to use debt financing rather than all cash in order to purchase an income-producing property? 
(1)The investor can deduct from taxable income the principal portion of debt repayments, thus lowering taxes payable. 
(2)A one-year term on the debt financing required is readily available. 
(3)The investor can obtain the debt financing at a lower interest rate than the expected yield on the project. 
(4)Property values are expected to decrease.","Answer: 3 Explanation: Option (3) is correct because an investor can typically procure debt financing at a rate lower than the expected yield on investment. This allows the investor to cover the debt payments with the revenue generated from the investment. Option (1) is incorrect because only the interest portion of mortgage payments are tax deductible. Option (2) is incorrect as most terms are typically longer than one term, and this provides no advantage to the investment. Option (4) is incorrect as the change in property values has no influence on the investor’s choice of debt or equity financing."
"Question 262: Shaylena is the listing agent for Dave’s property. The property has a large tree in the backyard, which Dave told Shaylena he will be removing before the property is sold. Dave has a busy week at work and has asked Shaylena not to present any offers to him until the week is over. Shaylena shows the property to Kiyoko, who says that the large tree will make a perfect spot for a tire swing. Shaylena does not mention that the tree will be removed. Kiyoko makes a full-price offer on the property, but Shaylena delays telling Dave about the offer until the week is over. What professional duty has Shaylena breached? 
(1)The duty to act honestly 
(2)The duty to communicate all offers in a timely manner 
(3)The duty to advise her client to seek independent professional advice 
(4)Shaylena has not breached any professional duties.","Answer: 1 Explanation: Option (1) is correct because licensees must act honestly with non-clients, which includes being truthful about the property and the fact that Dave intends to remove the tree before the property is sold. Option (2) is incorrect because an exception to the duty to communicate all offers to the client is if a client specifically instructs their licensee not to communicate offers to them promptly. Option (3) is incorrect because Shaylena has not been asked to give advice outside of her area of expertise. Option (4) is incorrect because Shaylena has breached the duties to act honestly and to act with reasonable care and skill."
"Question 263: Bob and Margaret execute a contract under seal. Which of the following is TRUE? 
(1)Because of the seal, there is no need for written acceptance. 
(2)Because of the seal, neither party needs to sign the contract. 
(3)Because of the seal, they do not need the intention to contract. 
(4)Because of the seal, there is no need for consideration.","Answer: 4 Explanation: Option (4) is correct because a contract made without consideration can still be enforceable if it is made under seal. However, all other elements of a valid contract must still be present. Options (1) and (2) are incorrect because executing a contract under seal does not remove the requirement under section 59 of the Law and Equity Act that, in most cases, contracts affecting land must be in writing and signed in order to be enforceable in court. Option (3) is incorrect because the parties must have intended to create legal obligations in order for a contract to be formed, whether or not it is executed under seal."
"Question 264: Which of the following statements is TRUE? 
(1)The total of the debit column on the seller’s statement must be identical to the total of the credit column on the buyer’s statement. 
(2)The practice is to hold the seller responsible for the taxes on the adjustment date itself. 
(3)On the completion date of the sale of real property, the buyer is usually entitled to the transfer of title. 
(4)The adjustment date and the possession date must be the same day.","Answer: 3 Explanation: Option (3) is correct because on the completion date the seller is obligated to transfer title and the buyer is obligated to pay the purchase price in accordance with the contract for purchase and sale. Option (1) is incorrect because the statements of adjustment of the buyer and seller are treated separately and are not comprised of identical information. Option (2) is incorrect because, although the amount of taxes for the year are apportioned between the parties as of the adjustment date, the party “held responsible” for their share of the taxes will depend on whether the property taxes for the year have been paid already by the seller or will be due in the future to be paid by the buyer. Option (4) is incorrect because, although the adjustment and possession dates are most often the same, they are not required to be so. The adjustment date may coincide with either the completion or possession date or fall in between the two."
"Question 265: Which of the following statements is TRUE regarding GST in a transaction for the sale of real estate? 
(1)GST generally does not apply to the amount of the deposit until the closing date. 
(2)GST will always apply to reimbursements for prepayments. 
(3)Under the Excise Tax Act, the seller is the party who is required to pay the GST. 
(4)All amounts found on the statements of adjustments are subject to GST.","Answer: 1 Explanation: Option (1) is correct because payment of the deposit is generally not subject to GST until closing occurs, at which time the full amount of the sale price (including the deposit) becomes taxable. Option (2) is incorrect because no GST applies to reimbursements for prepayments. Option (3) is incorrect because under section 165(1) of the Excise Tax Act, the buyer (the “recipient”) has the obligation to pay the GST. Option (4) is incorrect because only amounts on the statements of adjustments that are legally components of the purchase price are subject to GST."
"Question 266: S, a seller, offers to sell a property to A for $50,000. The offer is to remain open for acceptance until noon the next day. At 11:00 a.m. (the next day), B offers to buy the same property for $75,000 and S accepts. At 11:30, A accepts the original offer to buy the property for $50,000. Which of the following statements is TRUE? 
(1)S has entered into a contract with both A and B. 
(2)S could have revoked the offer to A and avoided the problem. 
(3)S was entitled to accept B’s offer. 
(4)All of the above three statements are true.","Answer: 4 Explanation: Option (4) is correct because all of the above statements are true. Option (1) is true because a contract is formed when there is unequivocal acceptance of an offer. When S accepted B’s offer to purchase the property for $75,000, a contract between S and B was formed. Then, when A accepted S’s offer to purchase the property for $50,000 within the time period stipulated in the offer, a contract between A and S was formed. Option (2) is true because an offer expires when the offeror communicates revocation before acceptance, so A would no longer have been able to accept S’s offer. Option (3) is true because S is entitled to accept B’s offer, but S will be liable for damages to A because S cannot convey the property as promised and will be in breach of their contract."
"Question 267: An interest only loan has an original loan amount of $15,000, carries an interest rate of 6.5% per annum, compounded semi-annually, and has monthly payments of $80.17. When will this loan be completely repaid? 
(1)670 months 
(2)696.44934 months 
(3)300 months 
(4)Impossible to determine from the information provided","Answer: 4 Explanation: Option (4) is correct because it is impossible to determine when the loan will be completely repaid with the information given. This is an interest only loan, and no payments are made on the principal. The principal of the loan is completely repaid on a date set between the lender and the borrower. Options (1), (2), and (3) are incorrect for this reason."

"Question 270: Which of the following is required in order for a trading services representative to maintain their licence? 
(1)The representative must be employed by an active brokerage at all times. 
(2)The representative must be licensed as a personal real estate corporation. 
(3)Each year, the representative must file a certificate signed by a chartered accountant certifying that the representative’s books and records required by the Real Estate Services Act have been maintained. 
(4)The representative must file at least one real estate transaction with the British Columbia Financial Services Authority each year.","Answer: 1 Explanation: Option (1) is correct because an individual must be licensed to and engaged by a brokerage in order to obtain and maintain a licence as a representative. Option (2) is incorrect because although a licensee may wish to incorporate his or her own Personal Real Estate Corporation, it is not a requirement that they do so as long as they are employed under and licensed to a brokerage. Option (3) is incorrect because ensuring the books and records are properly managed is a duty of the managing broker, not a representative. Option (4) is incorrect because there is no requirement for a representative to file at least one real estate transaction with the British Columbia Financial Services Authority each year."
"Question 271: As one lowers a discount (or expected yield) rate, the present value of a given series of future payments: 
(1)decreases. 
(2)could go up or down depending on the timing of the payments. 
(3)increases. 
(4)remains constant.","Answer: 3 Explanation: Option (3) is correct because the payments of a loan contract are calculated based on a contract yield rate. If the discount, or expected yield rate decreases, the present value of the given contracted payments increases. Options (1), (2), and (4) are incorrect for this reason."
"Question 272: Mary Smith has offered to purchase a house from a seller who is willing to provide partial financing. Her offer is a $75,000 down payment plus a mortgage of $125,000 at 4% per annum, compounded semi-annually. The loan is to be fully amortized with monthly payments of $755.31 over 20 years. If the market rate for similar mortgage loans is 7.5% per annum, compounded semi-annually, what is the market value of this offer, rounded to the nearest dollar? 
(1)$169,579 
(2)$108,618 
(3)$94,579

"Question 273: Earl is the registered fee simple owner of Blackacre. Duke forges and registers a transfer of Blackacre to himself in fee simple. Duke then borrows $50,000 from Royalty Trust Co. The loan is secured against Blackacre by way of a mortgage. Which of the following statements is TRUE? 
(1)Royalty is secure in relying on Duke’s title. 
(2)Earl can recover Blackacre but the title to the property will remain encumbered by Royalty’s mortgage. 
(3)Because of the forgery, Earl can recover Blackacre free of Royalty’s mortgage. 
(4)Royalty may obtain its $50,000 back from the Assurance Fund.","Answer: 3 Explanation: Option (3) is correct because the principle of indefeasibility will not protect a registered owner who is on title as a result of fraud in which he or she participated. Since Duke forged the transfer document, he is not protected by indefeasibility and Earl will be able to recover title to Blackacre from Duke. The property will not remain encumbered by Royalty’s mortgage because a mortgage is registered as a charge, and charges are not granted indefeasibility; rather, registration of a charge only raises a rebuttable presumption that the charge is valid. Options (1) and (2) are incorrect because the holder of a charge cannot rely on a title holder’s indefeasibility and Earl will be able to rebut the presumption of the validity of the mortgage by showing that Duke was registered on title as a result of forgery. Option (4) is incorrect because a claim against the Assurance Fund can only be successful where the operation of the Land Title Act caused the party to lose his or her interest, and Royalty would not have had an interest in the property at common law under the rule of nemo dat."
"Question 274: A borrower has arranged a loan of $32,000 at an interest rate of 7% per annum, compounded semi-annually with payments set at $1,400 per month. What is the amortization period of the loan?

"Question 275: Which answer MOST accurately describes an official community plan? 
(1)An official community plan is a policy statement regarding the planning of a community that, when adopted by bylaw, must be carried out in every detail by the council. 
(2)When a local government officially adopts a community plan, existing zoning bylaws that do not conform are suspended and land owners’ rights are then directly subject to the official community plan. 
(3)An official community plan is a plan that a regional district board has designed and adopted for one of its member municipalities, regardless of the views of the council of the municipality in question. 
(4)An official community plan states the objectives and policies of a local government that guide future decisions on planning and land use management, which represents the longer-term vision for the community.","Answer: 4 Explanation: Option (4) is the correct response because it describes an official community plan. Option (1) is incorrect because a community plan does not require the municipality or regional district to carry out every detail specified in the plan. Rather, it requires that all bylaws enacted, permits issued, and work undertaken after its enactment be consistent with the plan. Option (2) is incorrect because only bylaws enacted subsequent to the enactment of the plan are affected. Option (3) is incorrect because a plan prepared by a regional district may be required to provide the Minister of Municipal Affairs with information regarding public support for the plan, and the minister may require a referendum to determine the degree of public support for the plan."
"Question 276: The risk involved in being a mortgagee (a lender of funds secured by a mortgage) is: 
(1)lower than the risk involved when investing in Canadian government bonds for a similar time period. 
(2)unacceptable to many investors if the interest rate is high enough. 
(3)increased through careful appraisal of the value of the property and the credit rating of the borrower. 
(4)increased due to the greater degree of management time involved.","Answer: 4 Explanation: Option (4) is correct because the risk involved in being a mortgagee is increased due to the greater degree of management time involved. Option (1) is incorrect because mortgage risk is higher than that of Canadian government bonds. Option (2) is incorrect because investors are willing to accept higher risk for higher return; if the interest rate is high enough, investors will accept the risk of lending mortgage funds. Option (3) is incorrect because mortgage risk can also be reduced through careful borrower qualification measures."
"Question 277: On March 7, Allan contracts, in writing, to sell his home to Bob for the price of $100,000. The sale is to complete on March 31. Unknown to either Bob or Allan, the house was destroyed on March 6. Accordingly, there has been: 
(1)a mutual mistake. 
(2)a frustration of the contract. 
(3)a common mistake. 
(4)an anticipatory breach.","Answer: 3 Explanation: Option (3) is correct because a common mistake is one where both parties to a contract have made the same mistake about a fundamental term of the contract. Here, both parties have made the mistake of assuming that the home had not been destroyed at the time they entered into the contract. Option (1) is incorrect because a mutual mistake occurs when each party makes a different fundamental mistake about the contract, and in this case the same mistake was made. Option (2) is incorrect because frustration of a contract happens due to events occurring after the contract was entered into, and here the home was destroyed before the contract was formed. Option (4) is incorrect because an anticipatory breach occurs when one party announces that he or she will not perform before the time of performance arrives, which has not occurred in this scenario."
"Question 278: Lawson has rented his warehouse to Tyler, who runs a moving and storage business. Which one of the following is NOT a remedy available to Lawson if Tyler fails to pay his rent? 
(1)Lawson can re-enter the premises and forfeit the rent payable for the balance of the rental period. 
(2)Lawson may seize the personal property of Tyler and sell it in order to pay the arrears of rent. 
(3)Lawson can sue Tyler for the rent as would any creditor. 
(4)Lawson can apply under the provisions of the Residential Tenancy Act for an arbitrator to be appointed.","Answer: 4 Explanation: Option (4) is correct (i.e., would NOT be available as a remedy to Lawson) because this is a commercial tenancy, and so the Residential Tenancy Act would not apply. Options (1), (2), and (3) are incorrect because each of these remedies WOULD be available to Lawson for non-payment of rent on commercial premises."
"Question 279: Among other factors, the maximum amount that the buyer of a residential property may borrow is NOT affected by: 
(1)the buyer’s income. 
(2)the lending value of the property. 
(3)the prevailing mortgage interest rate. 
(4)the interest adjustment period.","Answer: 4 Explanation: Option (4) is the correct answer as the interest adjustment period of the loan will not affect the maximum amount a borrower may qualify for. Options (1), (2), and (3) are incorrect because with higher income, higher property lending value, and lower mortgage interest rates, a borrower will be able to qualify for a higher maximum loan."

"Question 281: The type of agency relationship that describes the situation where the licensee represents only one party as a client in a given transaction is called a: 
(1)sole agency relationship. 
(2)no agency relationship. 
(3)limited dual agency relationship. 
(4)full agency relationship.","Answer: 1 Explanation: Option (1) is correct because when a licensee represents only one party as a client in a given transaction, it is called a sole agency relationship. Option (2) is incorrect because an agency relationship exists when a licensee represents a client. Option (3) is incorrect because a limited dual agency relationship exists when a brokerage or licensee acts for multiple parties in a single trade in real estate, but because the duty of loyalty cannot be fulfilled to all clients, the clients agree to a limited form of agency relationship. This practice is now prohibited under section 63 of the Rules. Option (4) is incorrect because an agency relationship is not referred to as a “full agency relationship”."
"Question 282: You have a partially completed appraisal report that you need to fill in. The subject property has 4 bedrooms and 4 bathrooms. The house next door is similar in all respects except for the number of bathrooms and the number of bedrooms. The comparable sold for $221,000 and has 3 bedrooms and 3 bathrooms.

(1)$230,700 
(2)$211,300 
(3)$219,300

In this case, the subject property and the comparable are identical except that the subject property has 1 additional bedroom and 1 additional bathroom. The adjusted sale price is: $221,000 + $4,000 +$5,700 = $230,700."

(2)Learned negotiation skills can be used in one’s personal and professional life. 
(3)Reading about negotiation skills is not sufficient to master the skills, as practice is required as well. 
(4)The single best thing that you can do to improve your negotiation effectiveness is to take detailed notes during negotiations.","Answer: 4 Explanation: Option (4) is correct (false) because the single best thing you can do to improve your negotiation effectiveness is to prepare.

"Question 286: A “subject to” clause in a contract of purchase and sale is correctly known as a: 
(1)condition precedent. 
(2)warranty. 
(3)condition subsequent. 
(4)penalty clause.","Answer: 1 Explanation: Option (1) is correct because a condition precedent is a condition in a contract which must be satisfied before the contract is to be performed, and is the formal term for what is usually called a “subject to” clause in the real estate industry. Options (2), (3), and (4) are types of clauses which might be found in a contract that are distinct from “subject to” clauses. Option (2) is incorrect because a warranty is a clause which is not fundamental to the contract and whose breach would not allow a party to terminate the contract, only to sue for damages. Option (3) is incorrect because “subject to” clauses must are conditions precedent (they precede contractual performance) rather than conditions subsequent. Option (4) is incorrect because a penalty clause is a clause which states that a party who breaches the contract must pay a penalty to the innocent party. These clauses will not be enforced by the courts."
"Question 287: Once a licensee has obtained a signed acceptance from Allan of an offer to sell real estate owned by Bob and Carol jointly, the Real Estate Services Act requires the delivery of a copy of the agreement to: 
(1)Allan and Bob. 
(2)Allan, Bob, and Carol. 
(3)Bob. 
(4)Carol.","Answer: 2 Explanation: Option (2) is correct because the Real Estate Services Act requires a signed copy of the acceptance to be delivered to each of the parties to the transaction. Therefore, Allan, Bob, and Carol each require an individual copy as they are all parties to the transaction. Options (1), (3), and (4) are incorrect because they would each result in a party to the transaction not receiving a signed copy of the agreement."
"Question 288: When attempting to determine whether a particular relationship is that of landlord and tenant or licensor and licensee, it is best to: 
(1)look at the formal wording of the document. 
(2)look at the substance of the agreement between the parties. 
(3)consult the Residential Tenancy Act. 
(4)consult the Commercial Tenancies Act.","Answer: 2 Explanation: Option (2) is correct because the test to determine whether an agreement creates a lease or a licence is a matter of intention between the parties, which is determined by examining the agreement, the surrounding circumstances, and the purpose behind the agreement. Option (1) is incorrect because formal wording and inclusion of terms in an agreement such as “lessor/lessee” or “licensor/licensee” will not necessarily be determinative of parties’ intentions. Options (3) and (4) are incorrect because the Residential Tenancy Act and the Commercial Tenancy Act do not apply to the holder of a licence."
"Question 289: The comparative approach of appraisal is based on an analysis of recent sale prices for similar properties. Which of the following BEST defines the word “recent”? 
(1)A period of time during which at least four properties have sold in the subject property’s neighbourhood 
(2)A period of time of no less than one week and no more than six months 
(3)A period of time during which supply and demand conditions have not changed 
(4)A period of time during which the prime interest rate has been stable","Answer: 3 Explanation: Option (3) is correct because in the comparative approach of appraisal, “recent” refers to a time period during which demand and supply conditions in the area are relatively stable or do not change. “Recent” is the period of time, immediately preceding the appraisal date, during which property values in the region have remained stable. Options (1), (2), and (4) are incorrect for this reason."
"Question 290: Mortgage interest rates are sometimes described as being “sticky”; that is, changes in mortgage rates tend to lag behind changes in bond yields. One reason for this “stickiness” is: 
(1)the short-term nature of a mortgage loan contract. 
(2)the weak secondary mortgage market. 
(3)mortgages are highly liquid investments. 
(4)all mortgage investments are identical.","Answer: 2 Explanation: Option (2) is correct because a weak secondary market for mortgages means that there are not a large amount of buyers and sellers of mortgages that already exist. Due to this, the investors’ funds are “locked in” to the interest rate written in their original contracts, and they cannot achieve the current rate until the end of the term, or until they recover enough capital to initiate a new mortgage at the new rate. Options (1), (3), and (4) are incorrect because they do not describe reasons for mortgage rates’ “stickiness”."
"Question 291: Hurston, an employee of XYZ Preservatives Ltd., is in the habit of venting a cloud of highly toxic gas into the air at dusk every evening. Once it escapes, the cloud usually drifts over Ralph’s apple orchard. Hurston’s actions are strictly against company policy but by venting the gas Hurston saves time. Hurston is aware that the gas is highly toxic. Ralph has discovered that the emissions have destroyed his apple crop. Which one of the following statements is TRUE? 
(1)XYZ will not be liable for Hurston’s acts because Hurston was acting contrary to XYZ’s rules. 
(2)Ralph may be successful in a claim against XYZ based on the principle of private nuisance. 
(3)While Ralph will probably succeed in a claim against XYZ based on negligence, he will not have any remedy against Hurston. 
(4)Ralph would probably have a successful claim against XYZ based on the provisions of the Occupiers Liability Act.","Answer: 2 Explanation: Option (2) is correct because private nuisance occurs when an owner or occupier of land unreasonably and substantially interferes with the reasonable use and enjoyment of a neighbouring property, which includes activities which product noxious fumes. Hurston’s venting highly toxic gas over Ralph’s apple orchard, destroying his crop, would classify as an unreasonable and substantial interference with Ralph’s ability to use and enjoy his land. Option (1) is incorrect because XYZ could be vicariously liable for Hurston’s activities as their employee or negligent for failing to prevent Hurston from creating the nuisance. Option (3) is incorrect because Ralph would have a remedy against Hurston, as the person who created the nuisance is liable for doing so. Option (4) is incorrect because the Occupiers Liability Act would only apply if Ralph and/or his property had been harmed while on XYZ’s property."
"Question 292: A borrower would prefer a straight line principal reduction plan to a constant payment plan if the borrower: 
(1)wishes to delay repayment as long as possible. 
(2)foresees their income decreasing. 
(3)foresees their income increasing. 
(4)wishes to keep their initial payments as low as possible.","Answer: 2 Explanation: Option (2) is correct because a characteristic of a straight line principal reduction loan is that payments will decrease over time. This is favourable to a borrower that expects his or her income to decrease in the future. Option (1) is incorrect because a straight line principal reduction plan does not permit a borrower to delay repayment, as it provides for higher initial payments. Option (3) is incorrect because a borrower who foresees his or her income increasing would prefer to make higher payments in the future, rather than immediately. Option (4) is incorrect because initial payments will be higher than future payments."
"Question 293: Which of the following situations involves a breach of a duty owed by a licensee to a client? 
(1)Julio, a licensee, discovers the property his client Emma is interested in contains asbestos. He immediately discloses this information to Emma. 
(2)Gabriel, a licensee, is asked a complex question about mortgages by his client Koshi. Gabriel, unsure if he has the required expertise to answer the question, refers Koshi to a competent mortgage broker. 
(3)Billy receives an offer from Asuna to purchase his client Joel’s property. Asuna tells Billy she wants to demolish the existing house, and asks him not to tell Joel. Billy does not tell Joel the plans for the property, as Asuna asked him not to. 
(4)Simon receives six offers to purchase the house of his clients, the Garfunkels. Although two offers are significantly lower than the rest, he presents every offer to his clients.","Answer: 3 Explanation: Option (3) is correct because the duty of full disclosure requires Billy to disclose all known material information to his client, including the buyer’s intentions for the property. Option (1) is incorrect because Julio has followed his professional obligations and satisfied the duty of full disclosure. Option (2) is incorrect because Gabriel has fulfilled his duty to advise his client to seek independent professional advice on matters outside of his expertise. Option (4) is incorrect because Simon has communicated all of the offers he received to his client and fulfilled his professional obligations."
"Question 294: Which of the following would appear as a debit on the seller’s statement of adjustment? 
(1)The amount of a mortgage that the buyer will assume 
(2)The legal fees involved in discharging a judgment from the seller’s title 
(3)The amount of a penalty owing for overdue taxes 
(4)All of the above would appear as a debit on the seller’s statement","Answer: 4 Explanation: Option (4) is correct because all of the statements would appear as debits on the seller’s statement. Option (1) would appear as a debit on the seller’s statement of adjustments because an existing mortgage on title which will be assumed by the buyer on completion of the sale reduces the amount of cash that the buyer will owe to the seller. For Option (2), the seller is responsible for clearing the title of any encumbrances and any fees for this are the responsibility of the seller, which would reduce the amount of cash due to him or her and would be shown as a debit to the seller. For Option (3), the seller is liable to pay overdue taxes and any penalty owing as a result of late payment. This reduces the amount of cash owed to the seller and would appear as a debit on their statement of adjustments."
"Question 295: As a general principle, which one of the following is the proper method of communicating acceptance of an offer? 
(1)In writing 
(2)In the same form as the offer 
(3)By registered mail 
(4)By telephone","Answer: 2 Explanation: Option (2) is correct because the offeree should generally communicate acceptance using the same method as the offer was made, if the offer does not specify otherwise. Options (1), (3), and (4) are incorrect because they do not generally describe the proper means of communicating acceptance. Rather, they are methods of communication that are potentially acceptable, depending on the way in which the offer was communicated and the terms of the offer."
"Question 296: Which one of the following transactions does NOT affect the amount of owner’s equity? 
(1)Investments by the owner 
(2)Personal withdrawals from the business 
(3)Net income earned 
(4)Purchase of assets by the business","Answer: 4 Explanation: Option (4) is correct because purchasing assets will not affect owner’s equity. The purchase of the assets will either be funded by cash that will result in no net change in assets, or it will be funded by debt, which will increase both assets and liabilities. Option (1) is incorrect because Investment by the owner will increase the amount of equity. Option (2) is incorrect because personal withdrawals from the business will decrease the amount of equity. Option (3) is incorrect because earning net income will also increase the amount of equity."
"Question 297: Where a landlord refuses to allow a commercial tenant to take possession of the demised premises, the tenant may: 
(1)get an order for specific performance. 
(2)maintain an action for breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment. 
(3)sue the landlord for damages. 
(4)do none of the above.","Answer: 3 Explanation: Option (3) is correct because there is an implied covenant on the part of a commercial landlord to let the tenant into possession of the leased premises and, if they do not do so, they will be liable for damages. Option (1) is incorrect because a commercial tenant cannot get an order for specific performance in these circumstances due to the common law doctrine of interesse termini, which provides that no estate in land passes until the tenant takes possession. Option (2) is incorrect because quiet enjoyment relates to the tenant’s ability to use and enjoy the premises for all usual purposes without interference or unreasonable disturbance from the landlord, which would apply once the tenant is already in possession of the premises. Option (4) is incorrect because the tenant would be entitled to sue the landlord for damages."
"Question 298: Which one of the following does NOT form part of the definition of market value? 
(1)Value is a price that is reasonably expected to prevail. 
(2)Value is based on the personal opinion of the value to the owner. 
(3)Value is determined at a particular point in time. 
(4)The buyer and seller must be bargaining at arm’s length.","Answer: 2 Explanation: Option (2) is the correct answer because this option represents the subjective value to the owner. Market value should be an objective value at a specific point in time. Options (1), (3), and (4) all form part of the definition of market value."
"Question 299: Who may claim a home owner grant? 
(1)Anybody whose name appears on the assessment roll 
(2)The tenant of a property, if they have a lease exceeding three years 
(3)The owner of a property, whether they live there or not 
(4)The owner-occupier of a property","Answer: 4 Explanation: Option (4) is correct because the basic criteria to qualify for a home owner grant is that the person claiming the grant must be the owner of the property and must occupy it as a principal residence. Option (1) is incorrect because an owner’s name may appear on the assessment roll, but they would not qualify for a home owner grant if they were not occupying the property. Option (2) is incorrect because a tenant is not an owner of the property. Option (3) is incorrect because an owner must live at the property in order to claim a home owner grant."
"Question 300: To qualify for a managing broker’s licence, a person must possess which one of the following qualifications? 
(1)Have at least five years’ experience as a representative in British Columbia 
(2)Be a Canadian citizen 
(3)Be at least 19 years of age 
(4)None of the above are qualifications for a managing broker’s licence.","Answer: 3 Explanation: Option (3) is correct because, in addition to the educational and experience requirements, the Real Estate Services Act (RESA) requires that an applicant must be at least 19 years of age. Option (1) is incorrect because qualification for a managing broker’s licence requires a licensee to have been providing real estate services in a Canadian province or the Yukon for at least two years during the five years before the date of the application. Option (2) is incorrect because Canadian citizenship is not required to qualify for a managing broker’s licence. Option (4) is incorrect because a minimum of 19 years of age is required under RESA."
"Question 301: If a licensee falls into the narrow exception in the Rules for the practice of dual agency, they must ensure that which of the following agreements is entered into before providing services within the dual agency relationship? 
(1)An Agreement Regarding Conflict of Interest Between Clients 
(2)A written agreement of dual agency 
(3)A Disclosure of Interest in Trade form 
(4)A Disclosure of Risks to Unrepresented Parties form","Answer: 2 Explanation: Option (2) is correct because a licensee must obtain a written agreement of dual agency by both clients before providing services within the dual agency relationship. Option (1) is incorrect because an Agreement Regarding Conflict of Interest Between Clients is entered into when a licensee faces a conflict of interest when acting for multiple clients, and obtains written consent by all clients to continue to represent only one client. Option (3) is incorrect because a Disclosure of Interest in Trade form is required when a licensee or an associate of a licensee (being provided real estate services by the licensee) is to directly or indirectly acquire or dispose of real estate. Option (4) is incorrect because a Disclosure of Risks to Unrepresented Parties form is required when a licensee makes a disclosure under section 54 of the Rules to an unrepresented party while also representing a client to that trade in real estate."
"Question 302: It is a violation of the Real Estate Services Rules for a licensee to promise an owner that, if the owner enters into a listing agreement with the licensee’s brokerage, then the licensee will sell the owner’s property within a certain time, UNLESS: 
(1)full disclosure is made to both seller and buyer. 
(2)a signed statement setting forth the details of the promise is given to the person to whom the promise is made when the promise is made. 
(3)a copy of such promise is sent to the British Columbia Financial Services Authority. 
(4)a statement under oath acknowledging the promise (but lacking details of the promise) is provided to the person to whom the promise is made.","Answer: 2 Explanation: Option (2) is correct because under sections 49 and 50 of the Rules, licensees are prohibited from making promises to others in an attempt to induce them to enter into service agreements or enter into real estate transactions UNLESS the licensee delivers a signed statement setting out the details of the promise to the person to whom the promise is made. Options (1), (3), and (4) are incorrect because making full disclosure to both the seller and the buyer, sending a copy of such a promise to the British Columbia Financial Services Authority, and providing a statement under oath without details of the promise will not be enough to prevent a violation of the rule if the signed statement containing details is not given to the promisee."

(2)A strata corporation for a residential condominium complex that passes a bylaw severely restricting the number of lots that may be leased may restrict any renewals of existing leases until the total number of leased lots in the complex complies with the bylaw. 
(3)A bylaw that is passed by a strata corporation cannot be enforced against a strata lot owner unless or until it has been filed in the appropriate land title office. 
(4)The owners of the strata lots that are on the top floor of a residential condominium complex also own the airspace above their individual lots; however, the Strata Property Act restricts the use of the airspace to only those uses that are approved by a special resolution of the strata corporation.","Answer: 3 Explanation: Option (3) is correct because a strata corporation may amend the Standard Bylaws in the Strata Property Act by creating a new custom-made bylaw, but they may not enforce such a bylaw until it has been filed at the land title office. Option (1) is incorrect because a vote’s decision making value is not determined by the lot’s unit entitlement – rather, one vote per lot is given regardless of the size of the lot. Option (2) is incorrect because rental restriction bylaws do not apply to strata units for one full year following their passage or, if there is a tenant in a strata lot on the day the new bylaw is passed, the one-year grace period only begins on the day the tenant vacates the strata lot. Option (4) is incorrect because the strata lot is restricted to its description in the strata plan, and everything outside of that parcel is considered to be common property."
"Question 305: With respect to bylaws in a strata development, which of the following statements is TRUE? 
(1)Bylaws are passed by special resolution of the strata council. 
(2)Bylaws may limit an owner’s right to lease a strata lot if it is a commercial condominium complex. 
(3)Bylaws provide for the control and management of the strata lots and common property. 
(4)All of the above statements are true.","Answer: 3 Explanation: Option (3) is correct because bylaws govern owners’ obligations as well as their use of the strata lots and the common property and common assets. Option (1) is incorrect because bylaws are passed by the strata corporation, not just the council. Option (2) is incorrect because a strata corporation may only restrict the rental of a strata lot by a bylaw that prohibits the rental of residential strata lots, not commercial. Option (4) is incorrect because Options (1) and (2) are both incorrect."

(3)The best time to fly a drone is at night, when it is less likely to cause disruptions. 
(4)A Special Flight Operations Certificate is required to operate a drone weighing over 25 kilograms.","Answer: 4 Explanation: Option (4) is correct because Transport Canada requires a Special Flight Operations Certificate for drones weighing over 25 kilograms that are used for commercial purposes such as real estate marketing. Option (1) is incorrect because drones are less, not more, expensive than helicopters. Option (2) is incorrect because a drone used for real estate marketing must be insured. Option (3) is incorrect because a drone is generally flown during daylight hours."

"Question 309: Steve Johnson purchased a home two years ago, at which time he arranged for a mortgage in the amount of $175,000 amortized over 20 years with a 5-year term and monthly payments. The interest rate on the mortgage was 7% per annum, compounded monthly, calling for monthly payments of $1,356.78 and an outstanding balance of $150,948.60 due at the end of the 5-year term. Steve has just received an offer on his house from Linda. Linda’s offer consists of $45,000 cash and assumption of the existing mortgage for the remainder of the term. If current market rates for 3-year term mortgages are 5% per annum, compounded monthly, what is the market value of Linda’s offer?

(2)The easement must accommodate the dominant tenement. 
(3)The dominant and servient tenements must be owned by different parties. 
(4)The easement must be capable of forming the subject matter of a grant.","Answer: 3 Explanation: Option (3) is correct because there is no requirement for the dominant and servient tenements to be owned by different parties in order for an easement to be valid. Options (1), (2), and (4) are incorrect because an easement requires that there be a dominant and servient tenement, that the easement accommodate the dominant tenement, and that the easement be capable of forming the subject matter of a grant in order to be valid."
"Question 311: In British Columbia’s real property taxation system, the actual value of a property is: 
(1)the value at which the property last sold. 
(2)the amount of the tax burden. 
(3)the assessor’s estimate of lending value. 
(4)the value shown on the assessment notice.","Answer: 4 Explanation: Option (4) is correct because the Assessment Notice indicates the actual value of a property as determined by the assessor. Options (1), (2), and (3) are incorrect because they refer to concepts which do not determine the actual value of a property."
"Question 312: Corey has offered $431,000 for a house, providing he is able to obtain acceptable financing. The house lists for $442,000, but the lender has determined the lending value is $440,000. The lender requires a loan-to-value ratio of 80% and a gross debt service ratio of 32%. Property taxes are $2,750 per year and Corey’s annual gross income is $75,000.

(2)The ability to expropriate land and add it to the agricultural land reserve 
(3)The ability to pass regulations affecting agricultural reserve land 
(4)The ability to allow subdivision of agricultural reserve land","Answer: 2 Explanation: Option (2) is correct because expropriating land for the purpose of adding it to the agricultural land reserve is not included in the powers of the Agricultural Land Commission.

"Question 315: Which of the following is a liability on a financial statement? 
(1)Depreciation expense 
(2)Accumulated depreciation 
(3)Salaries payable 
(4)Interest expense","Answer: 3 Explanation: Option (3) is correct because salaries payable is a liability account because it represents money that is owed to another party. Options (1), (2), and (4) are incorrect because depreciation expense, accumulated depreciation, and interest expense accounts are not classified as a liability because they do not represent a future obligation to pay a third party."
"Question 316: A lease of real property is a contract by which the landlord conveys: 
(1)an easement to the tenant. 
(2)exclusive possession to the tenant. 
(3)a licence to occupy to the tenant. 
(4)a right of survivorship to the tenant.","Answer: 2 Explanation: Option (2) is correct because a lease grants exclusive possession of land to another (the tenant) for a specified term. Option (1) is incorrect because an easement is a separate type of interest in land which does not grant exclusive possession, but gives a landowner a limited right to use another’s land for the benefit of his or her land. Option (3) is incorrect because a license creates a privilege for the person who holds it to enter onto property for a certain purpose, but does not confer upon the licensee a lease or any other interest in the property. Option (4) is incorrect because a right of survivorship is a characteristic of a joint tenancy co-ownership whereby the estate automatically vests in surviving joint tenants on the death of a joint tenant."
"Question 317: Which of the following statements is FALSE regarding the seller’s obligations surrounding GST in a transaction for the sale of real estate? 
(1)Sellers are generally required to collect GST from the buyer as an agent for the government. 
(2)Where a seller fails to collect GST from the buyer, the seller becomes equally liable to the government for the amount of the tax. 
(3)When the seller collects GST from the buyer, it is deemed to be held in trust for the government until it is remitted. 
(4)If the seller receives an assessment from the Canada Revenue Agency for the amount of the GST after failing to collect it from the buyer, the seller has lost their ability to pursue the buyer for the amount of the tax and will be held fully liable for the amount.","Answer: 4 Explanation: Option (4) is correct (false) because where the Canada Revenue Agency sends an assessment to the seller for uncollected GST, the seller has a right to pursue the buyer for the amount of the GST. Options (1), (2), and (3) are incorrect because they are all true statements."
"Question 318: A borrower approaches a bank for a mortgage loan that has an 80% loan-to-value ratio. The contract rate is 3.9% per annum, compounded semi-annually and the government-specified qualifying rate is 5.25% per annum, compounded semi-annually. At what rate will the borrower have to qualify to fulfil the stress test borrower qualification rule for uninsured mortgages? 
(1)j2 = 5.9% 
(2)j2 = 7.5% 
(3)j2 = 5.5% 
(4)j2 = 3.9%","Answer: 1 Explanation: Option (1) is correct because the mortgage qualifying rate is based on the greater of the government-specified qualifying rate (5.25% as of June 2021) and 2% above the mortgage’s negotiated contract rate. In this case, you would apply a rate of j2 = 5.9% (2% + 3.9%), which is greater than the government-specified rate of j2 = 5.25%."
"Question 319: When Joan was viewing the apartment in a converted house that she was contemplating renting from Zack, she noticed that the steps and the handrail in the back staircase appeared to be in a state of disrepair. When Joan moved in after signing the lease, she discovered that she could not use the back stairs because the bottom three stairs were rotten and the handrail was not bolted down. Which of the following statements is TRUE? 
(1)Unless the lease provides that Zack will repair the premises, he has no responsibility to make any repairs. 
(2)Zack is only obligated to make any necessary repairs that are brought to his attention in writing at the time the parties enter the lease. 
(3)Joan is obligated to do the repairs if she wants them to be done, because she entered the lease aware of the condition of the premises. 
(4)Zack is obliged by law to maintain the premises in a state of repair that complies with safety standards, irrespective of the condition of the premises at the time the lease was entered.","Answer: 4 Explanation: Option (4) is correct because the landlord’s duty to repair requires that the landlord repair all types of residential premises under section 32 of the Residential Tenancy Act, even if they were in disrepair when the tenancy agreement was made. Options (1), (2), and (3) are incorrect because they are overruled by section 32 of the Act."
"Question 320: The essential distinction between a defect and a stigma is that: 
(1)a stigma increases the value of a property, whereas a defect decreases the value of a property. 
(2)a stigma must always be disclosed to the buyer, whereas a defect need not be disclosed to the buyer. 
(3)a stigma cannot be discovered by conducting a reasonable inspection and making reasonable inquiries, whereas a defect is visible upon reasonable examination. 
(4)a stigma’s effect on property value depends on an individual’s subjective considerations, whereas a defect’s impact can be objectively determined.","Answer: 4 Explanation: Option (4) is correct because while a defect’s impact on a property’s value can be objectively determined, a stigma’s effect depends on an individual buyer’s subjective considerations. Some may view the stigma as a liability, while others may not. Option (1) is incorrect because although stigmas can increase the value of a property, they can also decrease its value, depending on the individual buyer’s subjective preferences. Option (2) is incorrect because sellers are generally not required to disclose stigmas unknown to the buyer. Additionally, unlike stigmas, some defects must be disclosed by the seller. Option (3) is incorrect because whether or not the stigma can be discovered through reasonable inspection and inquiries is not a distinguishing feature of a stigma. Further, only certain defects are discoverable upon a reasonable examination."

(4)To suggest that unrepresented parties withdraw from a particular transaction if they do not find a licensee to represent them in that transaction","Answer: 1 Explanation: Option (1) is correct because a key purpose of the Disclosure of Risks to Unrepresented Parties form is to encourage unrepresented parties to obtain independent professional advice in respect of the trade in real estate. Option (2) is incorrect because it does not describe a purpose of the form, as a licensee is permitted to provide unrepresented parties with limited trading services, provided the licensee adheres to the Rules.

(1)Buyers and sellers do not necessarily attempt to achieve the greatest profit. 
(2)Each property is unique. 
(3)There is a more abundant flow of market information relating to current prices. 
(4)There are a small number of buyers and sellers relative to the total number of properties.","Answer: 3 Explanation: Option (3) is correct because the sub-market for single-family residences experiences many sales transactions so there is a more abundant flow of market information relating to current prices.

(2)Restrictions as to land use 
(3)The schedules outlining the regulations applicable to each particular zoning district

(3)the buyer will be responsible to pay their share of the property taxes to the seller on closing. 
(4)the seller’s share of the property taxes will be credited on their statement of adjustments.","Answer: 2 Explanation: Option (2) is correct because the seller’s share of the property taxes will reduce the cash proceeds due to him/her, and thus will be debited on his/her statement of adjustments. Option (1) is incorrect because taxes are apportioned between the parties as of the adjustment date and this is reflected on the statements of adjustments. Option (3) is incorrect because taxes may be paid out of the proceeds where taxes are due but have not yet been paid, whereas in this situation the taxes are not yet due.

Option (1) is incorrect because an open listing authorizes a real estate brokerage through its Designated Agent to sell the property; however, it does not prevent the seller from employing a number of other brokerages to also represent the seller through their Designated Agents. Option (2) is incorrect because a general listing is another name for an open listing. Option (4) is incorrect because a restricted listing is not a type of real estate agency listing contract."

The document states that: “I, John, grant to Mary and her heirs, assigns, executors, and administrators, a right of way for persons and vehicles along and upon the easterly 30 feet of the southerly 64 feet of Lot 1, Plan 910, in order to give access to Mary’s property, Lot 2, Plan 910.” The interest granted is: 
(1)a restrictive covenant. 
(2)a lease. 
(3)a licence. 
(4)an easement.","Answer: 4 Explanation: Option (4) is correct because the document grants a right of way, which is a form of easement, to Mary for the benefit of her land (the dominant tenement) over John’s land (the servient tenement). Option (1) is incorrect because a restrictive covenant imposes a restriction on the use of one person’s land for the benefit of another, and this document grants a positive right to use the land rather than a restriction. Option (2) is incorrect because a lease grants a right to possession for a certain amount of time, whereas this interest does not have an end date attached to it and it does not grant exclusive possession to the property. Option (3) is incorrect because a license is a privilege to enter onto premises for a certain purpose that is a personal right (i.e. can only be exercised by the person to whom it was granted) whereas this right is an interest which runs with the property rather than to Mary exclusively."
"Question 336: In using the cost approach, the MAJOR difficulty is experienced in calculating: 
(1)curable physical depreciation. 
(2)curable functional depreciation. 
(3)incurable physical depreciation. 
(4)replacement cost of the building as new.","Answer: 3 Explanation: Option (3) is correct because in using the cost approach of appraisal, the major difficulty is experienced in calculating incurable physical depreciation. The cause of the difficulty lies in determining the economic life of the building. Options (1), (2), and (4) are incorrect for this reason."
"Question 337: You are to appraise a single-family dwelling in an ordinary neighbourhood. If supply and demand factors have remained relatively stable for the last three months, a good comparable property is a similar property that: 
(1)has just been sold at a below-market price through a court ordered sale. 
(2)after two months’ exposure to the market, was sold one week ago. 
(3)is currently listed for sale as $125,000. 
(4)was sold at an above-market price four months ago.","Answer: 2 Explanation: Option (2) is correct because if supply and demand factors have remained relatively stable for the last 3 months, a good comparable property is a similar property that sold one week ago, after two months exposure to the market. This is the best comparable because the comparative approach is built on the premise that the market value of the subject property will be equal to the prices recently paid for similar properties. Options (1) and (4) are incorrect because they do not represent the market value of similar properties. Option (3) is incorrect because this similar property has not sold."
"Question 338: You have a partially completed appraisal report that you need to fill in. The 2,300 square foot subject property has 4 bedrooms. The house next door is similar in all respects except for the number of bedrooms and square footage. The 2,200 square foot comparable sold for $321,000 and has 3 bedrooms. If the market value of a bedroom is $3,200 and above an 1,800 sq. ft. benchmark, each 100 sq. ft. is worth $5,000, the adjusted sale price for this comparable is: 
(1)$329,200 
(2)$312,800 
(3)$323,700 
(4)$318,300","Answer: 1 Explanation: Option (1) is correct because to find the adjusted sale price of the comparable, take the sum of the listed sale price with its adjustments to the subject property. In this case, the subject property and the comparable are identical except that the subject property has 1 additional bedroom and is 100 square feet larger. The adjusted sale price is: $321,000 + $3,200 + $5,000 = $329,200."
"Question 339: “Reproduction cost” is best defined as: 
(1)the current construction cost of a building that would provide the same utility as the subject property. 
(2)the current cost of moving the building to a site where the building would represent the highest and best use of that site. 
(3)the current cost of constructing an exact replica of the subject property. 
(4)the original cost of construction, adjusted for inflation.","Answer: 3 Explanation: Option (3) is correct because reproduction cost is the current cost of constructing an exact replica of the subject property. Options (1), (2), and (4) are incorrect for this reason."
"Question 340: Which one of the following statements is FALSE? 
(1)A deposit is held by the brokerage as a stakeholder until the real estate transaction is completed. 
(2)Unless a deposit is paid when an offer to purchase is made, there is no binding contract for purchase and sale. 
(3)If a deposit is made by uncertified cheque, the brokerage should only issue a cheque on its trust account when the brokerage knows that the deposit cheque has been honoured. 
(4)Once an offer has been accepted, the brokerage may only return the deposit if all parties to the contract consent in writing to the release of the deposit.","Answer: 2 Explanation: Option (2) is correct (FALSE) because a binding contract of purchase and sale can be created if there is an offer, acceptance, and consideration. The exchange of promises to convey title to the property in return for the purchase price is valid consideration, even without a deposit. Options (1), (3), and (4) are incorrect because they are TRUE statements."
"Question 341: Which one of the following real properties must be assessed at market value for purposes of real property taxation? 
(1)A small house, surrounded by warehouse properties, owned continuously by one owner since January, 1946 
(2)Shell Oil pipelines 
(3)Residences owned by elected government officials 
(4)Land in the agricultural land reserve, which is also classified as farmland under the Assessment Act","Answer: 3 Explanation: Option (3) is correct because an ordinary residential property is assessed at market (actual) value. Option (1) is incorrect because it would qualify as a special residential property and could be assessed according to the value based solely on the current residential use. Option (2) is incorrect because pipelines are classified under Major Industry property and are assessed on a separate basis due to difficulty in determining actual value. Option (4) is incorrect because for real estate classified as farm land, the assessor must consider only the value of the property as a farm and exclude value attributable to any other potential uses (i.e. value in use is considered rather than actual value)."
"Question 342: On an interest accruing mortgage, which one of the following interest rates would result in the highest outstanding balance?

"Question 344: Given that all other factors are identical, the longer the term of the contract on a bonused, partially amortized mortgage (where the bonus is paid by the borrower): 
(1)the lower the effective interest rate paid by the borrower. 
(2)the higher the effective interest rate paid by the borrower. 
(3)the higher the required monthly payment. 
(4)the higher the outstanding balance at the term’s end.","Answer: 1 Explanation: Option (1) is correct because all things being equal, a longer term on a bonused partially amortized loan will result in a lower effective interest rate paid by the borrower. This is because the value of the bonus is paid off over a longer term, thus decreasing the annual cost of borrowing. Options (2), (3), and (4) are incorrect for this reason."
"Question 345: Sam and Sally recently negotiated a second mortgage in the amount of $25,000 at an interest rate of 9% per annum, compounded semi-annually. The loan is to be amortized over 20 years by monthly payments. As a result of a $3,000 brokerage fee, assume that only $22,000 of the loan’s $25,000 face value is advanced to Sam and Sally. The effective annual rate of interest charged on the funds advanced will be: 
(1)less than the effective annual equivalent of the contract interest rate.

"Question 346: Which of the following options is the generally accepted accounting principle that holds that all accounting information should be reported on objectively determined and verifiable data? 
(1)Consistency principle 
(2)Verification principle 
(3)Materiality principle 
(4)Objectivity principle","Answer: 4 Explanation: Option (4) is correct because the objectivity principle states that all accounting information needs to be objectively determined, as well as verifiable. Option (1) is incorrect because the consistency principle states that once an accounting policy is adopted, the company must continue to use the same policy in the future. Option (2) is incorrect because the verification principle is not a generally accepted accounting principle. Option (3) is incorrect because the materiality principle is not studied in this course."
"Question 347: Which of the following is NOT a procedure commonly used by a large institutional lender in order to reduce the risk associated with a particular mortgage loan? 
(1)Reduction of the loan-to-value ratio 
(2)Increase in the interest rate charged 
(3)Reduction in the gross debt service ratio 
(4)Reduction in the total debt service ratio","Answer: 2 Explanation: Option (2) is correct because increasing the interest rate is a way to accommodate increased risk by providing increased return for the lender, but this does not reduce the risk. In fact, a higher interest rate will result in a higher payment, making the risk of default even greater. Options (1), (3), and (4) are incorrect because they represent ways that a lender can reduce risk."
"Question 348: Where an offer has been made by post, an acceptance by post will be effective: 
(1)when posted. 
(2)when received. 
(3)when received, provided it is not lost in the mail. 
(4)when posted, provided it is not lost in the mail.","Answer: 1 Explanation: Option (1) is correct because where acceptance is intended to be by non-instantaneous means, which includes by post, the acceptance is effective when it is put in the mail rather than when it is actually received. If the acceptance is lost in the mail, there is still a binding contract as long as the offeree can prove the acceptance was actually mailed. For these reasons, Options (2), (3), and (4) are incorrect."
"Question 349: Which of the following is NOT a requirement of the Real Estate Development Marketing Act to protect the public? 
(1)Developers must meet any preliminary requirements or approvals applicable to the type of property being marketed. 
(2)Developers must assure the buyer's title upon purchase. 
(3)Developers must prepare and file a disclosure statement in the form required. 
(4)Developers must consult with members of the public over any proposed developments.","Answer: 4 Explanation: Option (4) is correct because there is no requirement for developers to consult with the public over proposed developments under the Real Estate Development Marketing Act (REDMA). Options (1), (2), and (3) are incorrect because developers are required to do each of these things under REDMA. Its purpose is to protect purchasers by requiring developers who market or intend to market development units in development properties to: meet any preliminary requirements or approvals applicable to the type of property to be marketed; ensure appropriate steps are taken to pay the cost of utilities or other related services and to assure the purchaser’s title (or other interest) upon purchase; and prepare and file a disclosure option in the form required by the BC Financial Services Authority."
"Question 350: Which one of the following is NOT a remedy available to the owner of a strata lot who is dissatisfied with certain actions of the strata corporation? 
(1)The owner may obtain a mandatory injunction against the strata corporation. 
(2)The owner may file a lien against the strata corporation. 
(3)The owner may have an arbitrator appointed. 
(4)The owner may apply to the Supreme Court of British Columbia for an order requiring the strata corporation to comply with the Strata Property Act.","Answer: 2 Explanation: Option (2) is correct because an owner cannot file a lien against the strata corporation because they are dissatisfied with the corporation’s actions. However, if an owner sues a strata corporation and succeeds, they may receive a judgment against the strata corporation. Options (1), (3), and (4) are incorrect because they are all remedies available under the Strata Property Act to an owner who is dissatisfied with acts of the strata corporation."
"Question 351: After determining that there are reasonable grounds to suspect that a transaction is related to a money laundering or terrorist financing offence, when must a licensee file a Suspicious Transaction Report? 
(1)After receiving approval from the licensee’s managing broker 
(2)When directed to file by a local law enforcement agency 
(3)As soon as practicable 
(4)Within 15 days of receiving any funds from the client","Answer: 3 Explanation: Option (3) is correct because a licensee is required to file a Suspicious Transaction Report (STR) as soon as practicable. Option (1) is incorrect because individual licensees have an obligation under the Proceeds of Crime (Money Laundering) and Terrorist Financing Act to file STRs, whether or not the managing broker approves. Option (2) is incorrect because law enforcement direction is not required to file an STR. Option (4) is incorrect because it is the requirement for filing a Large Cash Transaction Report. There is no specified number of days required for filing an STR, because the requirement is that it be filed as soon as practicable."
"Question 352: Which of the following statements is TRUE under the Torrens system in British Columbia? 
(1)A person whose fee simple title was transferred by a void deed can always recover title upon proving that they were the rightful owner. 
(2)The indefeasibility principle expresses the fundamental tenet that one cannot give what one does not have. 
(3)A void deed has no legal effect and is not capable of transferring any title in the land from the vendor to the purchaser. 
(4)Registered fee simple owners enjoy the guarantee of indefeasibility but registered chargeholders do not.","Answer: 4 Explanation: Option (4) is correct because in British Columbia, only fee simple owners are protected by the guarantee of indefeasibility. In Gill v. Bucholtz (2009) the British Columbia Court of Appeal confirmed that the Land Tile Act preserves the common law principle that “one cannot give another person that property which one does not have” with respect to registered charges. Options (1) and (3) are incorrect because under British Columbia’s Torrens system, the indefeasibility principle provides that when a person is named on a certificate of title as the owner of the fee simple estate in land, that is conclusive proof that he or she is entitled to that fee simple estate. Therefore, a fee simple owner cannot recover title from a good faith purchaser who acquires fee simple title by way of a void deed. Option (2) is incorrect because nemo dat quod non habet is the fundamental common law tenet that one cannot give what one does not have, which would protect the rightful owner. The indefeasibility principle protects the registered fee simple owner."
"Question 353: In conducting an appraisal, a market analysis is undertaken covering a range of factors. Which of the following is NOT a reason for including a market analysis in an appraisal report? 
(1)To indicate the current status of the subject property in relation to trends in property values 
(2)To confirm that comparable properties have been selected from the same market as the subject property and are subject to the same market forces 
(3)To provide the client with an appreciation of the socio-economic determinants of supply and demand 
(4)To reconcile the market value","Answer: 4 Explanation: Option (4) is the correct answer as reconciling the market value of the subject property is not a reason to include a market analysis in the appraisal report. Options (1), (2) and (3) are incorrect because they are valid reasons to include the market analysis in the appraisal report."
"Question 354: When an agent acting within the scope of their authority and having disclosed that they are acting as an agent enters into a contract with a third party, the parties to that contract are: 
(1)the agent and the principal. 
(2)the principal and the third party. 
(3)the third party and the agent. 
(4)the principal, the agent, and the third party.","Answer: 2 Explanation: Option (2) is correct because an agent is a person authorized to act on behalf of another person, the principal, so that they represent the principal in dealings with third parties. Therefore, while the agent is acting within the scope of his authority as an agent and after having disclosed that he is an agent for the principal, the contract will be between the principal for whom the agent is acting and the third party. Option (1) is incorrect because, although there would be a contract between the agent and the principal in order to establish the agency relationship, in this case the contract is with a third party. Options (3) and (4) are incorrect because the agent is acting on behalf of the principal as if he were stepping into the principal’s shoes rather than contracting for himself; therefore, the agent is not party to the agreement."
"Question 355: A lease granted by a tenant for a term that is less than the whole of their remaining interest granted in the original lease is referred to as: 
(1)an assignment. 
(2)a tenancy by sufferance. 
(3)a sub-lease. 
(4)a tenancy at will.","Answer: 3 Explanation: Option (3) is correct because a sub-lease is a lease by the original tenant (the sub-landlord) to a third party for less than the total remainder of the sub-landlord’s original lease term. Option (1) is incorrect because an assignment is the transfer by a party of all of the party’s interest in a property, i.e. for the total remainder of the lease term rather than a portion of it. Option (2) is incorrect because a tenancy by sufferance occurs when there is no tenancy because no lease exists. For example, if a tenant does not move out of the leased premises upon the expiration of the term of the lease. Option (4) is incorrect because a tenancy at will is where the tenant, with the consent of the landlord, occupies land as a tenant for a term which can be terminated by either party at any time."
"Question 356: Benson has purchased a home from Vanessa. The sale is completed on April 15 and the property taxes are adjusted on the completion date. Property taxes are due on July 1. In this case: 
(1)Vanessa will have to pay Benson for the share of the taxes from January 1 through April 14. 
(2)Vanessa and Benson will each pay ½ of the current year’s taxes on July 1 when they are due. 
(3)Benson will have to pay Vanessa for his share of the year’s taxes after she pays them on July 1. 
(4)Neither Vanessa nor Benson will have to pay any taxes on July 1 because the sale completed on April 15.","Answer: 1 Explanation: Option (1) is correct because where property taxes are to be paid in the future by the buyer, the seller owes the share of taxes from January 1 up to the adjustment date, in this case, up to April 14 as the adjustment date is April 15. Option (2) is incorrect because taxes are split according to the proportion of the year that each party has ownership of the property rather than an equal split. Option (3) is incorrect because Benson is responsible for paying taxes on July 1. Vanessa will have to pay Benson for her share of taxes from January 1 through April 14. Option (4) is incorrect because the property taxes will have to be paid regardless of when the sale completes."
"Question 357: A statement of profit and loss measures which of the following? 
(1)Assets acquired during a certain period of time 
(2)Revenues and expenses for a certain period of time 
(3)Revenues accrued at a single point in time 
(4)Assets and liabilities held at a single point in time","Answer: 2 Explanation: Option (2) is correct because the statement of profit and loss, also known as the income statement, measures revenues and expenses for a certain time period. Option (1) is incorrect because there is no financial statement that reflects the acquisition of assets of a certain period of time. Option (3) is incorrect because there is no financial statement that measures the revenues accrued at a single point in time. Option (4) is incorrect because the balance sheet is the financial statement that measures the assets and liabilities held at a single point in time."
"Question 358: The greatest bundle of rights and responsibilities that an individual can hold with respect to land is: 
(1)a fee simple interest. 
(2)a 99-year lease. 
(3)an easement. 
(4)a life estate pur autre vie.","Answer: 1 Explanation: Option (1) is correct because the estate in fee simple is the greatest estate in Canadian law, equivalent to what we ordinarily think of as outright ownership of real property, where the owner has rights to the land for so long as he or she has heirs. This includes the right to freely use and enjoy it, sell it, rent or lease it, grant mortgages or easements or other interests in land, and to dispose of it under the terms of a will. Options (2) and (4) are incorrect because leasehold estates and estates pur autre vie are estates in land less than fee simple since the interests have a prescribed end date and other conditions or obligations attached to the use and enjoyment of the land. Option (3) is incorrect because an easement is an interest in land less than an estate as it is a limited right to use another’s land rather than a full right to possession of the property."
"Question 359: With respect to the valuation of real property, value to the owner is most often required to be estimated in the context of: 
(1)churches and heritage buildings. 
(2)investment analysis. 
(3)a stable, unchanged market. 
(4)mortgage lending practice.","Answer: 2 Explanation: Option (2) is the correct answer because the value to owner cannot be used in appraisal, but may be used in investment analysis. Options (1), (3), and (4) are incorrect for this reason."
"Question 360: Which of the following correctly lists goods from the LEAST amount of shopping effort required to the MOST amount of shopping effort required? 
(1)Convenience goods, shopping goods, specialty goods, unsought goods 
(2)Shopping goods, convenience goods, unsought goods, specialty goods 
(3)Unsought goods, convenience goods, shopping goods, specialty goods 
(4)Convenience goods, unsought goods, specialty goods, shopping goods","Answer: 3 Explanation: Option (3) is correct because the shopping behaviour model classifies products and services based on the amount of effort that a consumer is willing to go through to obtain that product or service. In order of the amount of effort required by the consumer, from the least effort to the most effort, the goods are unsought goods, convenience goods, shopping goods, and specialty goods. Options (1), (2), and (4) are incorrect for this reason."
"Question 361: Which marketing effort focuses on a relatively small, but active and growing, target market? 
(1)Undifferentiated marketing 
(2)Differentiated marketing 
(3)Specialty marketing 
(4)Niche marketing",Answer: 4 Explanation: Option (4) is correct because niche marketing focuses on a relatively small but active and growing target market. Option (1) is incorrect because undifferentiated marketing is when a single product or service is marketed to all potential consumers with a single marketing program. Option (2) is incorrect because differentiated marketing refers to numerous similar products being marketed to different market segments using different marketing programs. Option (3) is incorrect because specialty marketing is a term not used in this course.

"Question 363: When completing a listing contract, a licensee should: 
(1)rely on all of the information provided by the seller. 
(2)only rely on the seller’s information if the seller says they have checked it. 
(3)independently check information with the appropriate authority where possible. 
(4)use the seller’s information, but advise all buyers that it is unreliable.","Answer: 3 Explanation: Option (3) is correct because a listing licensee has a duty to verify information for the listing and may be liable if they fail to do so and the buyers incur damages as a result. Options (1), (2), and (4) are incorrect because they would not meet the licensee’s duty to independently check the information provided to them by the seller where possible."
"Question 364: An assignment of a commercial lease may be made by a tenant to a third party: 
(1)only if there is an express provision in the lease allowing the tenant to do so. 
(2)only if the tenant has a licence to do so from the landlord. 
(3)only if the landlord’s consent can be implied from the course of dealings leading up to the execution of the lease. 
(4)unless the tenant is specifically prevented from doing so by a covenant in the lease.","Answer: 4 Explanation: Option (4) is correct because a tenant under a commercial lease may assign without the consent of the landlord unless there is an express prohibition in the lease. Options (1), (2), and (3) are incorrect because the presumption is that assignment is allowed unless otherwise specified in the lease, and none of the situations in these options are required for the presumption to prevail."
"Question 365: A developer of land not located in a municipality filed the necessary disclosure statement with the British Columbia Financial Services Authority with respect to his 20 lot subdivision. After foreclosure proceedings, the developer’s bank became the owner of the subdivision. The bank wishes to sell the lots on an individual basis. Which one of the following statements is TRUE? 
(1)Because the bank is selling more than five lots, it should file a disclosure statement with the British Columbia Financial Services Authority. 
(2)A further disclosure statement is not necessary. 
(3)The disclosure statement filed by the developer will satisfactorily protect people who purchase lots from the bank. 
(4)Because there has been a foreclosure, the bank is obligated to file a prospectus rather than a disclosure statement.","Answer: 1 Explanation: Option (1) is correct because under the Real Estate Development Marketing Act, a new disclosure statement is required when the identity of the developer changes. A developer is defined as a person who, directly or indirectly owns, leases or has a right to acquire or dispose of development property, subject to exclusion by regulation. Therefore, the bank would be considered a new developer and would have to file a new disclosure statement. For this reason, Options (2) and (3) are incorrect. Option (4) is incorrect because there is no requirement to file a prospectus rather than a disclosure statement in the event of a foreclosure."
"Question 366: Which one of the following statements is FALSE? 
(1)Given that the net operating income remains constant, the market value of a property falls as the required yield rises. 
(2)The market value of an income-producing property is best determined by averaging the sale prices of any three other income producing properties that have recently sold. 
(3)In the determination of an income-producing property’s market value, an appraiser should not confuse gross realized income with net operating income. 
(4)The capitalization rate applied to the net operating income of an investment property is related to the yield on comparable investment properties.","Answer: 2 Explanation: Option (2) is correct because, in the income approach of appraisal, the market value for any particular real estate property is determined by the yields that prospective purchasers reasonably expect to earn. Options (1), (3), and (4) are true and are therefore incorrect."
"Question 367: Which of the following is NOT a Personal Information Protection Act (PIPA) privacy principle? 
(1)Provide recourse 
(2)Obtain consent 
(3)Identify the proposal 
(4)Limit use, disclosure, and retention","Answer: 3 Explanation: Option (3) is correct because “identify the proposal” is not one of the 10 privacy principles provided for under the Personal Information Protection Act (PIPA). Option (1) is incorrect because Principle 10 is to provide recourse. Option (2) is incorrect because Principle 2 is to obtain consent. Option (4) is incorrect because Principle 5 provides for limiting use, disclosure, and retention."
"Question 368: In commercial mortgage underwriting, the factor calculated by dividing the annual net operating income by the annual sum of monthly mortgage payments is referred to as the: 
(1)safety margin factor. 
(2)mortgage ratio. 
(3)debt coverage ratio. 
(4)annual mortgage constant.","Answer: 3 Explanation: Option (3) is correct because the debt coverage ratio is calculated by dividing the annual net operating income by the annual sum of mortgage payments. Options (1), (2), and (4) are incorrect for this reason."
"Question 369: A counter-offer has the effect in law of: 
(1)leaving the original offer open for acceptance if the counter-offer is refused. 
(2)terminating the original offer so that later it cannot be accepted. 
(3)terminating all negotiations at that time. 
(4)accepting the original offer.","Answer: 2 Explanation: Option (2) is correct because a counter-offer terminates the original offer to become the new offer. Option (1) is incorrect because if the counteroffer is not accepted, the offeree cannot accept the first offer because it has already terminated. Option (3) is incorrect because a counter-offer does not terminate all negotiations, just the original offer. Option (4) is incorrect because a counter-offer does not have the effect of accepting the original offer but rather suggests new terms."
"Question 370: Which of the following events will terminate an agency relationship? 
(1)Revocation of the agency by the principal 
(2)Frustration 
(3)Performance 
(4)All of the above","Answer: 4 Explanation: Option (4) is correct because Options (1), (2), and (3) all constitute events which will end an agency relationship. If a principal revokes the authority of the agent orally or by conduct, the agency will be terminated. An event which frustrates the continuation of the agency contract would also terminate the relationship. Finally, once an agent has performed the actions for which he or she was given authority in the agency contract, the agency relationship will be over as an agent cannot act outside his or her scope of authority."
"Question 371: A property listed for sale has a net operating income of $15,763 per annum that is assumed to be perpetual and constant. The market capitalization rate is 9.5% per annum. What is the maximum price a prudent investor should pay for this property?

"Question 372: Charlie Brown and his sister, Sally, moved in next door to the house owned by Lucy VanPelt. Every afternoon, Lucy’s friend and tenant, Schroeder, a concert pianist, would practise on the VanPelt grand piano. Unfortunately, Sally, who worked the night shift, was a very light sleeper and was unable to sleep during Schroeder’s rehearsals. At Sally’s request, Charlie explained to his new neighbour that the piano playing caused the Brown house to vibrate, and Sally could not sleep. Lucy just replied, “Too bad,” and slammed the door on Charlie’s face. Which of the following statements is TRUE? 
(1)Lucy could successfully defend an action in private nuisance brought by the Browns for the piano vibrations by pleading volenti non fit injuriae, that is, that the Browns moved to the nuisance. 
(2)Sally’s condition of being a light sleeper would be a relevant factor in measuring the reasonableness of the noise, and Lucy will have to consider Sally’s condition in assessing her own conduct. 
(3)In order to be successful in a private nuisance suit, Charlie and Sally must prove that they have either suffered some interference with the use and enjoyment of, or physical damage to, their property. 
(4)If Charlie and Sally brought an action, only Lucy, as the landlord and occupier of the land would be liable for the nuisance.","Answer: 3 Explanation: Option (3) is correct because the two types of damages recognized in the case of a private nuisance are unreasonable interference with another occupier’s use and enjoyment of property, and interference which causes physical damage to the property. Option (1) is incorrect because the courts have held that it is no defence to a nuisance action to say that the plaintiff came to the nuisance. Option (2) is incorrect because the standard against which reasonableness is measured is that of the average reasonable person, and it is not relevant that a plaintiff happens to be unusually sensitive unless the defendant seeks to take advantage of that fact. Option (4) is incorrect because the person who creates the nuisance (in this case, Schroeder) is liable for creating it, and in a landlord and tenant situation, the tenant occupier is primarily liable for nuisances created on the property."
"Question 373: Which of the following is the main reason that interest accruing loans are normally written for short terms? 
(1)For long terms, borrowers generally prefer to make periodic payments. 
(2)Total payments decline over the term of an interest accruing loan, so the sooner the loan is refinanced, the higher the potential return to the lender. 
(3)The lender’s return and original investment are at risk for the entire term of an interest accruing loan. 
(4)The outstanding balance of an interest accruing loan declines over the term of the loan, so it is prudent for the lender to keep the term short.","Answer: 3 Explanation: Option (3) is correct because an interest accruing loan poses a high risk to the lender, since the entire amount of principal and interest is outstanding for the entire length of the term. Due to this, these loans are typically written for short terms. Option (1) is incorrect because although it is a true statement, it is not the reason interest accruing loans are written for short terms. Options (2) and (4) are incorrect because they are false statements."
"Question 374: Sue purchased a townhouse in December 20X2 for $145,000. Five years later, it was appraised at $260,000. Seven years after the townhouse was purchased, Sue sold the townhouse for $190,000. What was the pre-tax yield on her investment expressed as an effective annual rate?

"Question 375: Where a condition precedent is inserted in a contract of purchase and sale, a licensee might also include a “time clause”. Which of the following definitions accurately describes such a clause? 
(1)The clause requires the removal of the condition precedent within a reasonable time. 
(2)The clause states specifically the date by which the condition precedent must be removed. 
(3)The clause permits the seller to require the removal of the condition precedent within a specified time, if a better offer is received. 
(4)None of the above three statements accurately describes a “time clause”.","Answer: 3 Explanation: Option (3) is correct because a time clause in a contract for purchase and sale of land allows a party to invoke a time period in which a condition precedent must be removed, where the right to invoke the clause arises on the vendor receiving another offer after entering the original contract of purchase and sale. Option (1) is incorrect because it must be for a specified time period, not just a “reasonable time.” Option (2) is incorrect because the date by which the condition precedent must be removed depends on the vendor receiving another offer, and so the time period is set out in the contract during which the condition must be removed rather than a specified date. Option (4) is incorrect because Option (3) correctly describes a time clause."

"Question 377: Listed below is one of the most important powers given to municipal councils in regulating the subdivision of land. Identify it. 
(1)They may require that all lots within the proposed subdivision be capable of being served by cable television. 
(2)They may require that all residential units within the proposed subdivision be in excess of a certain construction value specified in the bylaw. 
(3)They may require that not more than one lot in the proposed subdivision be sold to any given buyer in order to discourage speculation in building lots. 
(4)They may require that highways of a prescribed standard be provided as well as street lighting and underground wiring.","Answer: 4 Explanation: Option (4) is correct because the Local Government Act provides that subdivision bylaws created by municipal councils may regulate the location, width, alignment and grade of highways and may also require that the subdivider provide street lighting and underground (as well as wiring, water, sewer and drainage systems, fire hydrants, and roads) within the subdivision. Options (1), (2), and (3) are incorrect because they are outside of the scope of what bylaws created by municipal council are permitted to regulate with regard to the subdivision of land."
"Question 378: From the point of view of the lender, the interest charged on a mortgage does NOT represent: 
(1)a payment for a portion of the general overhead and operating costs of the lender. 
(2)the cost of financing the lender’s debt. 
(3)an incentive to accept uncertainty or risk. 
(4)a return on capital invested.","Answer: 2 Explanation: Option (2) is the correct answer as it is the only option that is not represented by interest received by a lender. Interest due or paid represents the cost of financing debt, not interest received. Options (1), (3), and (4) all represent interest charged on a mortgage and are therefore incorrect."
"Question 379: The relationship between a brokerage and its related licensees is recognized and reinforced by certain provisions of the Real Estate Services Act (“RESA”). According to RESA: 
(1)when a licensee advertises real estate on behalf of a client, the brokerage’s name must be displayed in a prominent way. 
(2)a licensee is entitled to advertise real estate on behalf of a client without the name of the listing brokerage appearing in the advertisement, providing the licensee’s name is displayed in a prominent way. 
(3)when a property is listed by the seller’s brokerage and the buyer is represented by a different brokerage, both the seller’s agent and the buyer’s agent are paid their commission directly from the seller’s brokerage. 
(4)real estate brokerages that charge only desk fees and pay 100% of the commission to their representatives are not responsible for the actions of the representatives.","Answer: 1 Explanation: Option (1) is correct because under section 40 of the Rules, when a licensee advertises real estate, the name of the brokerage must be displayed in a prominent and easily readable way. Options (2), (3), and (4) are not provided for under the Real Estate Services Act and are therefore incorrect."
"Question 380: Which one of the following items is deducted from gross realized income to arrive at net operating income when preparing an appraisal using the income approach? 
(1)Income tax 
(2)Interest on the mortgage 
(3)Real property taxes 
(4)Depreciation expense","Answer: 3 Explanation: Option (3) is correct because real property taxes are a component of operating expenses, which are deducted from gross realized income to arrive at net operating income when preparing an appraisal using the income approach. Options (1), (2), and (4) are incorrect because income tax, interest on a mortgage, and depreciation expense are not included in operating expenses and do not factor into the calculation of net operating income."
"Question 381: A tenancy that automatically renews itself on the last day of the term for a further term of the same duration until terminated by either party with proper notice is called a: 
(1)tenancy at will. 
(2)tenancy at sufferance. 
(3)periodic tenancy. 
(4)term fixed tenancy.","Answer: 3 Explanation: Option (3) is correct because a periodic tenancy is one which automatically renews itself on the last day of the term for a further term of the same length until it is terminated by either party with proper notice. Option (1) is incorrect because a tenancy at will is a tenancy where a tenant, with the consent of the landlord, occupies land for a term which can be terminated by either party at any time. Option (2) is incorrect because a tenancy at sufferance occurs when there is no tenancy because no lease exists, for example, if a tenant does not move out of the leased premises upon the expiration of the term of the lease. Option (4) is incorrect because a fixed term tenancy has a predetermined date at which the tenancy expires."

"Question 384: When a judge “distinguishes” a case on its facts, this means: 
(1)the judge decides that facts crucial to a former decision are not present in the case at hand, and does not follow the former decision. 
(2)the judge formally reports the case before them because it is a crucial decision. 
(3)the judge follows a former decision because the same facts exist in the case that is being decided. 
(4)the judge refers the case to an appeal court because of its difficulty.","Answer: 1 Explanation: Option (1) is correct (and therefore Options (2), (3), and (4) are incorrect) because distinguishing a case occurs when a judge decides the factual circumstance of the case at hand is not similar enough to the former decision to warrant following the judgment, and therefore the decision will not be binding on the judge."
"Question 385: Which of the following could appear as a charge on a Certificate of Title? 
(1)A notation that the property is held in a trust for a specified beneficiary 
(2)An easement in favour of a local telecommunications company 
(3)An indication that the property is held in the name of an executor for the estate of a deceased person 
(4)A notice that the duplicate certificate of title has been taken out of the land title office","Answer: 2 Explanation: A charge is any interest in land less than a fee simple. Rights of way, liens, mortgages, and easements are all examples of charges. Option (2) is correct because an easement is a type of interest in land less than a fee simple that can be registered under the Land Title Act and thus may appear on a Certificate of Title as a charge. Options (1), (3) and (4) are incorrect because while indications of all of these circumstances may appear on a Certificate of Title, none of them necessarily indicate an estate or interest in land, and so they do not constitute a charge."

(1)$208,373 
(2)$180,000 
(3)$209,943 
(4)Impossible to calculate with the information provided","Answer: 2 Explanation: Option (2) is correct because land is never depreciated, so the purchase price is $180,000. Options (1), (3), and (4) are therefore incorrect."
"Question 387: Which of the following would generally NOT be found in the current liabilities section of a balance sheet? 
(1)Current portion of long-term debt 
(2)Property taxes payable 
(3)Income taxes payable 
(4)Rent receivable","Answer: 4 Explanation: Option (4) is correct because rent receivable is the only option that would not be found in the current liabilities section. Current liabilities are those debts that are expected to be repaid within the next year, and rent receivable is not a debt that is payable, it is an asset that is receivable. Options (1), (2), and (3) are incorrect because they are all current liabilities."
"Question 388: In establishing the actual value of a residential property for tax assessment purposes the Assessor may consider:

(3)the rental value of the property. 
(4)a comprehensive list of factors including all of those mentioned above.","Answer: 4 Explanation: Option (4) is correct (and Options (1), (2), and (3) are incorrect) because the Assessment Act states that factors which the assessor may consider in determining actual value include: present use, location, original cost, replacement cost, revenue or rental value, selling price of the land and improvements and comparable land improvements, economic and functional obsolescence, and any other circumstances affecting value."
"Question 389: Where a buyer under a standard contract of purchase and sale refuses to perform, the seller will NOT have which of the following remedies? 
(1)Specific performance 
(2)Damages for loss of bargain 
(3)Damages relating to the costs of preparing necessary documents 
(4)The forfeiture of a deposit, representing fifty percent of the purchase price, as liquidated damages","Answer: 4 Explanation: Option (4) is correct because deposits for real estate transactions are 5-10% of the total purchase price, so a deposit of 50% as liquidated damages will likely not be enforced by the courts since it would not be a reasonable pre-estimate of damages. Option (1) is incorrect because the courts will award specific performance to the seller if damages are considered to be an inadequate remedy. Options (2) and (3) are incorrect because the court will award damages to any party who can prove that he or she has suffered loss as a result of a breach of contract so as to return them to the position they would have been in had the contract been performed as promised."
"Question 390: Which of the following is the British Columbia Financial Services Authority NOT explicitly empowered to investigate under the Real Estate Services Act? 
(1)Wrongful taking or deceptive dealing 
(2)Breaches of the REALTOR Code 
(3)Breaches of the Act 
(4)Incompetence as a licensee","Answer: 2 Explanation: Option (2) is correct because the Real Estate Services Act does not give the British Columbia Financial Services Authority (BFCSA) the power to investigate breaches of the REALTOR Code. The REALTOR Code is a professional ethical code that has been developed by the Canadian Real Estate Association and is enforced by local real estate boards, not BCFSA. Options (1), (3), and (4) are incorrect because section the Real Estate Services Act empowers BCFSA to conduct an investigation to determine whether a licensee has committed professional misconduct, and wrongful taking or deceptive dealing; contravention of the Act, the Regulations or Rules; and incompetence in performing any activity for which a license is required all amount to professional misconduct under section 35 of the Real Estate Services Act."
"Question 391: A term of the mortgage provides that the full outstanding balance will become due and payable in the event of default by the borrower in making any payment. This term is known as: 
(1)the repayment clause. 
(2)the personal covenant. 
(3)the omnibus clause. 
(4)the acceleration clause.","Answer: 4 Explanation: Option (4) is correct because the acceleration clause is a term in the contract which brings the maturity date of the loan forward if the borrower defaults, so that the outstanding balance is immediately due and payable. Option (1) is incorrect because the repayment clause states that the full amount outstanding is due and payable on a fixed date after the loan is made (i.e. it sets the maturity date, which can be brought forward by the acceleration clause in the case of default). Option (2) is incorrect because the personal covenant is the personal contractual promise made by the mortgagor to pay the mortgage money and interest of the mortgage. Option (3) is incorrect because the omnibus clause gives the lender an alternative to accelerating the loan if the borrower defaults."
"Question 392: Which of the following statements is TRUE? 
(1)Taxes always appear as a credit on the seller’s statement of adjustments and as a debit on the buyer’s statement of adjustments. 
(2)Where the licensee acts only for the seller, real estate commission always appears as a debit on the seller’s statement of adjustments and does not appear on the buyer’s statement of adjustments. 
(3)Conveyancing fees always appear as a debit on the buyer’s statement of adjustments and as a credit on the seller’s statement of adjustments. 
(4)None of the above","Answer: 2 Explanation: Option (2) is correct because the commission is paid by the seller only, and so it would appear as a debit to the seller (reducing the amount of cash proceeds of sale due to the seller) and the buyer’s statement would not be affected. Because of this, Option (4) is incorrect. Option (1) is incorrect because taxes will appear as a credit on the buyer’s statement of adjustments and a debit on the seller’s statement of adjustments in the case that taxes are to be paid in the future by the buyer. Option (3) is incorrect because, although it is true that conveyancing fees would appear on the buyer’s statement of adjustments as a debit, the fees would not be included in the seller’s statement of adjustments."

(1)The quarterly payment will be $49,701. 
(2)The outstanding balance at the end of the term will be less than $1,123,500. 
(3)Under the terms of the federal Interest Act, the total outstanding balance on this loan can be prepaid at any time after five years from the initiation date of the mortgage. 
(4)The lender has no right to demand payment of the total outstanding balance at any time prior to the end of the contractual term provided the borrower meets all contractual obligations.","Answer: 3 Explanation: Option (3) is false. Individual borrowers, not corporations, have the right, under the terms of the Interest Act, to prepay all of the outstanding balance at any time after five years from the initiation date of the mortgage.

(1)In an entirely residential condominium complex, a bylaw must be amended by a ¾ vote of the strata corporation. 
(2)If a rule conflicts with a bylaw, the bylaw prevails. 
(3)Subject to some exemptions, a bylaw may prohibit the rental of strata lots in the condominium complex. 
(4)Assuming the standard bylaws have not been amended, the strata council may pass rules with respect to the safety and cleanliness of individually owned strata lots.","Answer: 4 Explanation: Option (4) is correct (false) because the standard bylaws do not allow the strata council to pass rules with respect to the safety and cleanliness of individually owned strata lots – they can only do so with respect to the common property. Options (1), (2), and (3) are all incorrect because they are true statements."
"Question 396: Which one of the following will NOT be found on the balance sheet of a corporation? 
(1)Number of shares issued 
(2)Original cost of the property owned by the corporation 
(3)Names of the corporation’s shareholders 
(4)Retained earnings to date","Answer: 3 Explanation: Option (3) is correct because the names of individual shareholders are not included on a corporation’s balance sheet because this could represent anywhere from one shareholder to millions of shareholders. Option (1) is incorrect because the shareholders’ equity section of the balance sheet does list the number of shares issued and outstanding. Option (2) is incorrect because the original cost of property owned by the corporation (i.e., its assets) is listed on the balance sheet. Option (4) is incorrect because retained earnings to date are also listed on the balance sheet."
"Question 397: Which of the following describes a method of identifying an individual that meets a licensee’s “Know Your Client” obligations under the Proceeds of Crime (Money Laundering) and Terrorist Financing Act? 
(1)Viewing a client’s government-issued photo identification during a videoconferencing call 
(2)Matching personal information provided by the client to a Canadian credit file that has been in existence for at least three years 
(3)Reviewing a client’s provincial driver’s licence that has been expired for less than 6 months 
(4)Referring to information from an offshore financial entity that confirms that the client holds a deposit account with that entity","Answer: 2 Explanation: Option (2) is correct because it correctly describes a method that a licensee can use to identify an individual. Option (1) is incorrect because when using government-issued photo identification to identify an individual, the licensee must either examine the document in person, or virtually through sophisticated software that will analyze its security features. Videoconferencing will not meet this requirement. Option (3) is incorrect because the government-issued photo identification must be valid and current, and an expired driver’s licence, even if it has only been expired for a short period of time, will not meet this requirement. Option (4) is incorrect because an offshore financial entity is not considered a reliable source for the purposes of the dual process method of identification."
"Question 398: In which of the following situations will a contract with an infant be enforceable against the infant? 
(1)The contract is affirmed by the infant after they reach 19 years of age. 
(2)The infant performs or partly performs the contract after reaching their 19th birthday. 
(3)The infant does not repudiate the contract within a year after reaching their 19th birthday. 
(4)The contract is enforceable against the infant in all of the above situations.","Answer: 4 Explanation: Option (4) is correct (and Options (1), (2), and (3) are incorrect) because section 19(1) of the Infants Act provides that a contract entered into by an infant will be unenforceable against the infant unless another statute provides that the contract is enforceable, the infant affirms the contract after turning 19, the infant performs or partially performs the contract after turning 19, or the infant does not repudiate the contract within one year of turning 19."

(4)apartment buildings.","Answer: 2 Explanation: Option (2) is correct because the income approach is generally only used to for income-generating investment properties. Single-family residences are generally not income-generating investment properties, and are more frequently owner occupied. Options (1), (3), (4) are incorrect because the income approach is more often used for warehouses, leasehold interests, and apartment buildings."
"Question 400: Where a principal of an agent has acted in such a manner as to lead third parties to believe that their agent has authority to perform certain acts on their behalf, and the third party, when dealing with the agent, reasonably believes that the agent has the authority that they represent, the agent is said to have: 
(1)actual authority. 
(2)express authority. 
(3)legal authority. 
(4)apparent authority.","Answer: 4 Explanation: Option (4) is correct because apparent authority results where a reasonable third party would consider, from the conduct or statements of the principal and agent, that the agent did, in fact, possess authority. Option (1) is incorrect because actual authority refers to the authority given to the agent by the principal in their agency agreement and includes express authority, implied authority, and customary authority. Option (2) is incorrect because express authority is the authority created by the terms of the agency contract and does not need to be implied by acts of the parties. Option (3) is incorrect because legal authority is not a recognized category of agency (although the terms of the agency agreement could include giving the agent authority to make legal decisions)."
"Question 401: Who owns the common property of a strata corporation? 
(1)The owner-developer of a strata project, as a trustee for the individual strata lot owners 
(2)The strata corporation 
(3)Each individual strata lot owner owns a share of the common property of a strata corporation in the proportions set out in the Schedule of Unit Entitlement 
(4)None of the above","Answer: 3 Explanation: Option (3) is correct because each strata owner jointly owns the common property of the strata development, and the Schedule of Unit Entitlement determines each owner’s proportionate, undivided ownership share as a tenant in common of the common property in the strata plan. Option (4) is incorrect for the same reason. Option (1) is incorrect because the owner-developer is not a trustee for the individual strata lot owners. Option (2) is incorrect because, although the strata corporation exercises exclusive control over the common property, it is still owned jointly by the individual strata lot owners."
"Question 402: At the time a transaction is completed, which one of the following items will be the responsibility of the buyer? 
(1)Tax penalty with respect to overdue taxes 
(2)Costs of preparing a first mortgage 
(3)Unpaid taxes to possession date 
(4)Commission",Answer: 2 Explanation: Option (2) is correct because a borrower is normally charged the costs of preparing and registering a new first mortgage. Option (1) is incorrect because the seller is responsible for the full amount of any penalty; it is not adjusted because only the seller was liable to pay and failed to do so in a timely manner. Option (3) is incorrect because taxes up until the possession date are owed by the seller; the buyer is only responsible for taxes from the possession date until December 31. Option (4) is incorrect because the commission is normally paid by the seller.
"Question 403: Where a licensee intends to purchase property, which of the following details must they disclose to the seller? 
(1)The fact that they hold a real estate licence 
(2)Any details that have been arranged for the resale of the property 
(3)The fact that they will be sharing in the commission on the sale 
(4)All of the above information must be disclosed.","Answer: 4 Explanation: Option (4) is correct (and Options (1), (2), and (3) are incorrect) because under section 53 of the Rules, where a licensee is acquiring real estate, disclosure must be made to the other party before the agreement is entered into by providing them with the Disclosure of Interest in Trade form, which includes an indication that the licensee is licensed under RESA, the terms under which the real estate is to be resold (where applicable), and the amount of remuneration or other money that is anticipated to be received by the licensee."
"Question 404: When using the cost approach of appraisal to estimate the value of a building that currently contains urea formaldehyde foam insulation (UFFI), insulation should be considered in your calculation as: 
(1)a part of the land value. 
(2)only a deduction for depreciation. 
(3)part of the overall replacement costs and a deduction for depreciation. 
(4)a component of site value.","Answer: 3 Explanation: Option (3) is correct because when using the cost approach of appraisal to estimate the value of a building that contains urea formaldehyde foam insulation (UFFI), insulation should be considered in your calculation as part of the overall replacement costs and as a deduction for depreciation. Option (3) is incorrect for this reason. Options (1) and (4) are incorrect because insulation would not be a part of the land/site value."
"Question 405: An investor has decided to establish a bank account in order to accumulate sufficient capital at the end of seven years to purchase a boat. If the account pays interest at 3% per annum, compounded annually and the investor makes deposits of $8,000 at the end of each year, how much capital will he have accumulated at the end of 7 years?

"Question 406: A contract between a seller and a buyer whereby the seller agrees to sell its interest in certain property to the buyer for a price payable by instalments and then to convey legal title to the buyer after payment of the purchase price in the manner agreed, is called: 
(1)a mortgage. 
(2)an agreement of purchase and sale. 
(3)an equity of redemption. 
(4)an agreement for sale.","Answer: 4 Explanation: Option (4) is correct because an agreement for sale is a purchase agreement whereby the purchaser agrees to pay the purchase price of the property (usually with a down payment plus monthly payments of principal and interest) directly to the seller. Option (1) is incorrect because under a mortgage the title is registered to the purchaser and the vendor’s mortgage is registered as a charge, while in an agreement for sale the vendor remains on the title as registered owner and promises to execute a transfer as soon as the final payment is made. Option (2) is incorrect because an agreement of purchase and sale is a contract for the purchase of land which contains the obligations of the vendor and purchaser with respect to the transaction. Option (3) is incorrect because the equity of redemption is the mortgagor’s right to repay the mortgage and regain title even after the contractual date for repayment has passed."
"Question 407: Given a nominal rate of interest of 5%, the greater the frequency of compounding: 
(1)the lower the effective annual rate. 
(2)the higher the rate per compounding period. 
(3)the higher the yield to the lender. 
(4)the lower the payments to the borrower.","Answer: 3 Explanation: Option (3) is correct and can be illustrated by way of example. A loan with an interest rate of 5% compounded annually will yield a $5 return at the end of the year for a $100 investment. If it was a nominal rate of 5%, compounded semi-annually, the yield would be $5.06025 (a 5.06025% effective rate). Therefore, increasing the compounding period increases the yield to the lender. Options (1), (2), and (4) are incorrect for this reason."
"Question 408: The remuneration figures contained in the Disclosure of Expected Remuneration (Payment) form: 
(1)can be disclosed as a percentage or a dollar amount. 
(2)must be expressed as a dollar amount if the remuneration is to be received as money. 
(3)must be expressed in the same way that they are expressed in the listing contract. 
(4)can be expressed in any way that is most transparent to the seller.","Answer: 2 Explanation: Option (2) is correct as remuneration that is to be received as money must be expressed as a dollar amount in the Disclosure of Expected Remuneration (Payment) form. Options (1), (3), and (4) are incorrect for this reason."
"Question 409: Which one of the following BEST describes shareholders’ equity? 
(1)Share capital plus retained earnings 
(2)Retained earnings plus dividends 
(3)Share capital plus retained earnings plus dividends 
(4)Net income less dividends",Answer: 1 Explanation: Option (1) is correct because the shareholders’ equity section on a corporation’s balance sheet is made up of two accounts: share capital and retained earnings. Options (2) and (3) are incorrect because this section does not include dividends. Option (4) is incorrect because net income is already accounted for within the retained earnings account.
"Question 410: ABC Inc. paid $155,000 for an asset on which the Income Tax Act allows capital cost allowance (CCA). The asset was purchased five years ago and will be disposed at the end of this year. How much CCA will be claimed by ABC Inc. at the end of this year? 
(1)$7,750 
(2)$5,997 
(3)$0 
(4)$2,500","Answer: 3 Explanation: Option (3) is correct because according to the capital cost allowance rules set out by the Canada Revenue Agency, in the year an asset is disposed of, no CCA deduction is allowed on that asset. In the case of ABC Inc., no CCA may be claimed at the end of the current year. Options (1), (2), and (4) are therefore incorrect."
"Question 411: Which statute requires that a brokerage keep at least one trust account in a savings institution in British Columbia? 
(1)The Real Estate Services Act 
(2)The British Columbia Property Manager’s Act 
(3)The Bonding Act 
(4)The Bank Act","Answer: 1 Explanation: Option (1) is correct (and Options (2), (3), and (4) are incorrect) because section 25 of the Real Estate Services Act requires a brokerage to maintain one or more interest bearing trust accounts in British Columbia."
"Question 412: A seller refuses to sign a subject removal form to strike out a condition precedent from a contract of purchase and sale. Assuming that the condition was made exclusively for the benefit of the buyer, the agreement is: 
(1)binding. 
(2)unenforceable. 
(3)voidable at the option of the seller. 
(4)void.","Answer: 1 Explanation: Option (1) is correct because where a condition is for the sole benefit of the buyer, the buyer may waive it and thus the agreement would be binding. Because a binding agreement can be enforced and is not void, Options (2) and (4) are incorrect. Option (3) is incorrect because the condition was made for the benefit of the buyer, so it would only be voidable at the option of the buyer, not the seller."
"Question 413: Before valuing a house, an appraiser should assume that: 
(1)the registered owner is not the ultimate source of data on the property. 
(2)the registered owner has a fee simple interest in the land. 
(3)“value to owner” equals “market value”. 
(4)the property is unencumbered.","Answer: 1 Explanation: Option (1) is correct because an appraisal should not rely on the registered owner as the ultimate source of data on the property. Instead, the appraiser is often expected to perform his or her own research an analysis. An appraiser should not make assumptions represented in Options (2), (3), or (4)."
"Question 414: A borrower has arranged a $159,000 mortgage at j2 = 12% with a 20-year amortization, 5-year term, and monthly payments. If all payments are paid when due, how much principal was paid off during the 5-year term?

(1)No time limit is specified in the offer but a reasonable time has passed without acceptance by the offeree. 
(2)The offeror dies or becomes insane before the offeree accepts the offer. 
(3)The offer is revoked by the offeror and the revocation is communicated to the offeree before acceptance. 
(4)The offeror decides to revoke their oral offer and mails a written revocation to the offeree, which the offeree has not yet received.","Answer: 4 Explanation: Option (4) is correct because the revocation of an offer must be actually communicated to be effective (the postal acceptance rule does not apply to revocation). Therefore, the offer is still valid and can be accepted until the revocation reaches the offeree. Options (1), (2), and (3) are incorrect because the offer is released or expired in each of those scenarios."
"Question 416: A mortgage for $300,000 is written at 6.5% per annum, compounded monthly. The mortgage calls for monthly payments rounded to the next higher dollar, a 5-year term, and a 25-year amortization. The mortgage contract permits the borrower to prepay the full amount of the loan at any time subject to the payment of an interest rate differential penalty. At the time of prepayment, the current comparable interest rate is 4.5% per annum, compounded monthly. If the borrower wishes to prepay this loan at the end of the second year (with the 24th payment), calculate the amount of the interest rate differential penalty.

"Question 417: Functional depreciation can be defined as: 
(1)the loss in value caused by an outmoded or inadequate design. 
(2)the loss in value caused by changing market conditions, which reduce demand for the property. 
(3)the loss in value caused by physical wear. 
(4)a loss in value that can always be corrected economically.","Answer: 1 Explanation: Option (1) is correct because functional depreciation can be defined as the loss in value caused by an outmoded or inadequate design. Options (2), (3), and (4) are incorrect for this reason."
"Question 418: Where an agent, with express authority, enters into a contract with a third party on behalf of their principal and the third party knows they are an agent, who will the law recognize as parties to that contract? 
(1)The agent and the third party 
(2)The agent, the principal, and the third party 
(3)The principal and the third party 
(4)None of the above","Answer: 3 Explanation: Option (3) is correct because an agent is a person authorized to act on behalf of the principal, so that they represent the principal in dealings with third parties. Therefore, while the agent is acting within the scope of his authority as an agent and after having disclosed that he is an agent for the principal, the contract will be between the principal for whom the agent is acting and the third party. Option (4) is incorrect for the same reason. Options (1) and (2) are incorrect because the agent is acting on behalf of the principal as if he were stepping into the principal’s shoes rather than contracting for himself; therefore, the agent is not party to the agreement."
"Question 419: Ownership of land includes not only the surface of the land, but also which of the following options? 
(1)The column of airspace above it insofar as the owner can make effective use of it 
(2)The branches of any of the neighbour’s trees that hang over the owner’s property 
(3)Anything that comes over the boundary line 
(4)All of the above are included in ownership of land",Answer: 1 Explanation: Option (1) is correct because a landowner owns or has rights in the airspace above his or her property to the extent that he or she can effectively use it. Options (2) and (3) are incorrect (and Option (4) is therefore also incorrect) because the fact that an object has entered the boundaries of your property does not give you ownership rights over it.
"Question 420: Which one of the following is NOT a remedy available for a private nuisance? 
(1)Abatement 
(2)Damages 
(3)Specific performance 
(4)Injunction","Answer: 3 Explanation: Option (3) is correct because specific performance involves the court ordering a party to carry out a specific action, which the courts will not grant as a remedy for nuisance – they will only make an order for a party to stop doing a particular act (i.e. an injunction). Options (1), (2), and (4) are each incorrect because injunctions, damages, and abatement are all remedies which are potentially available for a private nuisance."
"Question 421: Question 421 SKIPPED due to format 
(1)Abatement 
(2)Damages 
(3)Specific performance 
(4)Injunction","Answer: 3 Explanation: Option (3) is correct because this financial statement is known as the balance sheet. A balance sheet, or statement of financial position, shows all of the company’s assets, liabilities, and the equity of the shareholders at a single point in time. Options (1) and (2) are incorrect because the statement of profit and loss, also known as the income statement, shows the company’s revenues and expenses. Option (4) is incorrect because there is no financial statement known as a corporate statement of holdings."
"Question 422: Where a deposit is paid directly to a seller on account of the purchase price: 
(1)the amount of the deposit will appear only on the buyer’s statement of adjustments. 
(2)the amount of the deposit will appear on both the buyer’s and the seller’s statement of adjustments. 
(3)the deposit will only appear on the seller’s statement of adjustments. 
(4)the deposit will not appear on either statement of adjustment.","Answer: 2 Explanation: Option (2) is correct because a deposit which is paid directly to a seller (rather than to the brokerage) will appear as a credit to the buyer and a debit to the seller, because it will reduce the cash proceeds to be received by the seller upon completion. Because of this, Options (1), (3), and (4) are incorrect. Although a deposit which is paid to the buyer’s brokerage will only appear on the buyer’s statement of adjustments and not the seller’s, this is not the case where the deposit is paid directly to a seller."
"Question 423: You have a partially completed appraisal report that you need to fill in. The subject property has 4 bedrooms and 4 bathrooms. The house next door is similar in all respects except for the number of bedrooms and bathrooms. The comparable has a sale price of $281,000, a –$3,200 adjustment for bedrooms, and a +$2,700 adjustment for bathrooms. If the market value of a bedroom is $3,200 and the market value of a bathroom is $2,700, it can be concluded that this comparable has: 
(1)5 bedrooms and 2 bathrooms. 
(2)3 bedrooms and 3 bathrooms. 
(3)4 bedrooms and 3 bathrooms. 
(4)5 bedrooms and 3 bathrooms.","Answer: 4 Explanation: Option (4) is correct because in relation to the subject property, this comparable has one more bedroom and one less bathroom. Options (1), (2), and (3) are therefore incorrect."
"Question 424: Two mortgages requiring constant blended payments are identical in all respects except that one has a five-year term and the other has a two-year term. The monthly payments on the five-year term mortgage would be: 
(1)higher than those required on the two-year term mortgage. 
(2)lower than those required on the two-year term mortgage. 
(3)the same as those required on the two-year term mortgage. 
(4)impossible to compare given the information presented.","Answer: 3 Explanation: Option (3) is correct because the difference in term has no impact on the monthly payments. Since the loan amount, interest rate, and amortization period are all the same, the monthly payments will be the same. Options (1), (2), and (4) are incorrect for this reason."
"Question 425: Which one of the following is NOT a required provision in a lease? 
(1)The amount of rent and method of payment 
(2)The commencement and term of the lease 
(3)The signatures of the parties 
(4)The previous address of the lessee","Answer: 4 Explanation: Option (4) is correct because there is no requirement, statutory or common law, that the previous address of the lessee be included as an essential term of the lease agreement. Options (1), (2), and (3) are incorrect because the Residential Tenancy Act requires the rent and the date on which the tenancy starts to be included in every tenancy agreement, and also requires that the agreement be in writing and signed and dated by both the landlord and tenant."
"Question 426: A young executive has applied to her bank for a mortgage loan to enable her to purchase a house. Her income is $45,000 per year.

"Question 427: If there is no listing contract in existence but the agent effects a sale of the principal’s property at the request of the principal, the courts will: 
(1)not imply an undertaking to pay the agent remuneration. 
(2)imply a promise to pay the agent remuneration. 
(3)allow the agent to collect only their out of pocket expenses. 
(4)hold the agent liable for any default of the buyer.","Answer: 2 Explanation: Option (2) is correct because in the case where there is no listing contract but the agent effects a sale of the seller’s property at the request of the seller, the courts can apply the principle of quantum meruit to imply a promise to pay a reasonable amount for the professional services provided. Option (1) is incorrect for the same reason. Option (3) is incorrect because the courts will give a reasonable remuneration based on what the service provided was worth, not just out of pocket expenses. Option (4) is incorrect because, even if there was a listing contract between the agent and the principal in this case, the agent is working on behalf of the seller and so they would not be held liable for the buyer’s default."
"Question 428: Suppose XYZ Ltd. is located in a building that was purchased two years ago for $1,000,000. The building has an economic life of 10 years with no salvage value. Annual depreciation is calculated using the straight-line method.

"Question 429: A licensee wants to add a new client to her electronic mailing list. Which of the following statements is FALSE? 
(1)The client must be provided with an option to unsubscribe. 
(2)The licensee may not send email marketing materials without first obtaining consent from the new client. 
(3)If a client provides consent to being added to the mailing list, they cannot be removed from it within the following 12 months. 
(4)The licensee should ensure that the client’s email address is up to date.","Answer: 3 Explanation: Option (3) is false and is the correct answer. A client must provide consent when being added to a mailing list [Option (2)], but even after consent is obtained, the sender must be provided with a way to request to be removed from the mailing list [Option (1)] and any such requests must be honoured immediately. Option (4) is incorrect because an email database needs to be maintained regularly and if the client’s correct email address is not being used, then they will not receive the messages."
"Question 430: Which of the following options is a current asset on the balance sheet? 
(1)The owner’s initial investment 
(2)Rent payable 
(3)Real property at its historic cost 
(4)Rent receivable","Answer: 4 Explanation: Option (4) is correct because rent receivable is considered a current asset. A current asset is something that the company owns, and will use up within the next year. Option (1) is incorrect because the owner’s initial investment will be listed as owner’s equity. Option (2) is incorrect because rent payable will be listed as a current liability. Option (3) is incorrect because real property will be recorded as a fixed or long-term asset, and will be recorded at its historic cost."
"Question 431: Susan Seller discovered a secret arrangement between her agent and Bella Buyer where Susan’s agent would give some of the commission payable by Susan to her agent directly to Bella. Based on this situation, which of the following statements is TRUE? 
(1)Because there was no detriment to Susan, the agent did not breach any duties owed to her. 
(2)The agent breached her duty to disclose material facts to Susan, but this does not amount to a breach of fiduciary duty. 
(3)The agent breached her fiduciary duty owed to Bella; therefore, the contract of purchase and sale between Susan and Bella is void. 
(4)The agent’s non-disclosure is a breach of her fiduciary duty to Susan, and as a consequence, the agent may not be entitled to the commission claimed.","Answer: 4 Explanation: Option (4) is correct because the agent’s duty of disclosure includes everything known to the licensee respecting the transaction and is not limited to situations where there is a detriment to the seller. Failure to make full disclosure amounts to a breach of the fiduciary duty and where this duty is breached, the seller may not be required to pay the licensee a commission on closing. Options (1) and (2) are incorrect for the same reason. Option (3) is incorrect because the agent is acting on behalf of the seller, and thus her fiduciary duty is to Susan, not to Bella."
"Question 432: Which of the following security measures would BEST prevent unauthorized internet users from accessing your computer when connected to the internet? 
(1)Firewalls 
(2)Passwords 
(3)Spam 
(4)Protecting hardware","Answer: 1 Explanation: Option (1) is correct because firewalls are hardware and software boundaries frequently used to prevent unauthorized users from accessing private computers or networks connected to the internet. All data attempting to pass through the firewall is blocked unless it meets a certain criteria of authorization needed to pass through. Options (2), (3), and (4) are therefore incorrect."
"Question 433: Under the British Columbia land title system, a mortgage is registered as a charge against the property of which the mortgagor is: 
(1)the first registered charge holder. 
(2)the last registered charge holder. 
(3)the registered owner. 
(4)not registered.","Answer: 3 Explanation: Option (3) is correct because under the Torrens system in place in British Columbia, all mortgages are registered as charges against the title and the title will continue to show the borrower (mortgagor) as the registered owner, not as a charge holder. Option (1), (2), and (4) are incorrect for the same reason."
"Question 434: Operating expenses for appraisal purposes include: 
(1)income taxes. 
(2)property taxes. 
(3)mortgage payments. 
(4)capital cost allowance.","Answer: 2 Explanation: Option (2) is correct because property taxes are an expense included in operating expenses for appraisal purposes.

"Question 435: Given that all other factors are identical, the shorter the term of the contract on a bonused, partially amortized mortgage (where the bonus is paid by the borrower): 
(1)the lower the effective interest rate paid by the borrower. 
(2)the higher the effective interest rate paid by the borrower. 
(3)the higher the required monthly payment. 
(4)the lower the outstanding balance at the term’s end.","Answer: 2 Explanation: Option (2) is correct because all things being equal, a shorter term on a bonused partially amortized loan will result in a higher effective interest rate paid by the borrower. This is because the value of the bonus is paid off over a shorter term, thus increasing the annual cost of borrowing. Options (1), (3), and (4) are incorrect."

(1)Exterior brick veneer 
(2)Interior wood panelling on perimeter walls

(1)Anton dies. 
(2)Bentley dies. 
(3)Charles dies. 
(4)all three men die.","Answer: 2 Explanation: Option (2) is correct because an estate pur autre vie ends when the person whose life upon which it is based dies, in this case, Bentley. Option (1) is incorrect because Anton’s interest is dependent on Bentley’s life, not his own. Option (3) is incorrect because Anton’s interest is not terminated when Charles dies, rather, Charles (or his heirs, if Charles dies before Bentley) will receive the interest that Anton currently holds once Bentley dies, ending Anton’s interest.

(1)If Patricia cannot sell her home by December 31, there is no contract and Velma retains the deposit. 
(2)Patricia must complete even if she cannot sell her home. 
(3)Patricia may waive this requirement at any time before completion.

Option (1) is incorrect because in a standard form contract of purchase and sale, unless each condition is waived or declared fulfilled, the Contract will be terminated and the deposit would be returned (i.e., Velma would not retain the deposit). Option (2) is incorrect because the contract will be cancelled if Patricia does not fulfill the subject clause by selling her home and she does not waive it, so Patricia will not be forced to complete. Option (3) is incorrect because Patricia must waive the requirement on or before the date specified in the clause (December 31) rather than any time before completion."

(1)The mortgage qualifying rate is always based on an additional 2% above the mortgage’s negotiated contract rate.

"Question 446: Duress, in law, consists of: 
(1)actual or threatened violence or imprisonment. 
(2)difficulty of performance. 
(3)undue influence. 
(4)a misrepresentation made knowingly or recklessly, not caring whether it be true or false.","Answer: 1 Explanation: Option (1) is correct because common law duress occurs where a person is forced to enter into a contract against his or her will by the threat of imprisonment either to himself or his family, or the threat of actual physical violence. Option (2) is incorrect because difficulty of performance would arise after a contract was entered into, whereas duress relates to the party being robbed of the free will to enter into the contract. Option (3) is incorrect because undue influence is a separate concept from duress. Although it also relates to the loss of free will to contract, it is as a result of a person in a superior or dominant position in relation to another using their position to induce the other to enter a contract which he or she would not have otherwise made rather than as a result of a threat. Option (4) is incorrect because it describes negligent misrepresentation rather than duress."

(1)January 1-September 20. 
(2)September 20-December 31. 
(3)September 21-December 31. 
(4)July 2-December 31.","Answer: 2 Explanation: Option (2) is correct because where taxes have previously been paid by the seller, the buyer will reimburse them for the portion of the year starting from and including the adjustment date, (i.e., the portion of the year that they have ownership of the property.) In this case, this includes September 20 to December 31. Options (1), (3), and (4) are incorrect for this reason."
"Question 449: The cost approach of appraisal is NOT generally used to value: 
(1)airport hangars. 
(2)vacant lots. 
(3)condominiums. 
(4)single-family residences.","Answer: 2 Explanation: Option (2) is correct because the cost approach of appraisal is generally used for unique properties that do not have any comparable sales data, relying on a land value estimate from direct comparison, then valuing the improvements on the land with the cost approach. Since vacant land has no improvements the cost approach cannot be used on vacant land. Options (1), (3), and (4) could be valued using the cost approach in certain circumstances."
"Question 450: A gain or reward received by an agent from a third party in connection with their agency relationship with the principal, if it not disclosed to the principal, is known in agency law as: 
(1)a secret profit. 
(2)a taxable gain. 
(3)permitted third party remuneration. 
(4)a latent defect.","Answer: 1 Explanation: Option (1) is correct because a gain or reward received by an agent from a third party in connection with his or her agency relationship with the principal, if not disclosed to the principal, is known as a secret profit. Options (2), (3), and (4) are incorrect for this reason."
"Question 451: An agent’s authority can be created retroactively by their principal by an action called: 
(1)rectification. 
(2)ratification. 
(3)rescission. 
(4)revocation.","Answer: 2 Explanation: Option (2) is correct because an agent’s authority can be granted retroactively through ratification where an agent enters into a contract on behalf of the principal that is beyond the agent’s authority, but the principal later consents to be bound by the unauthorized acts of the agent. Option (1) is incorrect because rectification occurs when a court corrects an error made by the parties in a contract (or other document) in order to reflect the parties’ true intentions. Options (3) and (4) are incorrect because rescission and revocation are concepts to do with offer and acceptance in contract law rather than agency."

(1)The name of the parties 
(2)A description of the premises being leased 
(3)The rent 
(4)The addresses and occupations of the parties","Answer: 4 Explanation: Option (4) is correct because it is not an essential term of the lease (whether commercial or residential) to include the occupations of the parties.

(1)Frank and Joe have formed a binding and enforceable contract. 
(2)Because the requirement of writing contained in section 59 of the Law and Equity Act has not been complied with, a contract has not been formed. 
(3)There has not been a valid offer and acceptance and therefore a contract has not been formed. 
(4)Both (2) and (3) are true.","Answer: 3 Explanation: Option (3) is correct, because in order for a valid contract to be formed, there must be acceptance of an offer. In this case, although both parties have made identical offers, neither offer has been accepted by the other party. Joe has not accepted Frank’s offer because he did not have notice of the offer before sending the email to Frank; rather, he has make a separate offer. Option (1) is incorrect for the same reason. Option (2) is incorrect because section 59 of the Law and Equity Act requires most contracts affecting land to be in writing, and since this is not a contract respecting land, section 59 would not apply. Therefore, Option (4) is also incorrect."
"Question 454: The Law and Equity Act contains provisions for the unilateral waiver by a party of a condition precedent. Which one of the following is NOT one of the requirements? 
(1)The condition precedent has been satisfied. 
(2)The condition precedent benefits only that party to the contract. 
(3)The contract is capable of being performed without fulfillment of the condition precedent. 
(4)Where a time is stipulated for fulfillment of the condition precedent, the waiver is made before the time stipulated.","Answer: 1 Explanation: Option (1) is correct because satisfying the condition precedent is not a requirement for waiver under the Law and Equity Act. Options (2), (3), and (4) are incorrect because section 54 of the Law and Equity Act requires that, in order to waive a condition precedent, the condition precedent must benefit only the party waiving it, the contract must be capable of being performed without fulfillment of the condition precedent, and the waiver must be made before the time stipulated for the condition’s fulfillment (or within a reasonable time if not specified)."

(1)Revocation 
(2)Rectification 
(3)Rescission 
(4)None of the above",Answer: 1 Explanation: Option (1) is correct because revocation refers to the cancellation of an offer communicated by the offeror to the offeree prior to acceptance. Option (2) is incorrect because rectification occurs when a court corrects an error made by the parties in the contract (or other document) in order to reflect the parties’ true intentions. Option (3) is incorrect because rescission refers to the cancellation of a contract. Option (4) is incorrect because Option (1) is correct.
"Question 456: When borrowers increase their maximum allowable loan by accepting a shorter term and a lower interest rate, the borrowers have: 
(1)an increased degree of risk regarding changes in the interest rate over time. 
(2)the security of never having to incur another set of transaction costs (legal, appraisal) when arranging a new loan with another lender. 
(3)a decreased degree of risk regarding changes in the interest rate over time. 
(4)committed to paying more interest during the shorter term loan than the longer term loan.","Answer: 1 Explanation: Option (1) is correct because if borrower agrees to a shorter term in order to increase the maximum allowable loan, they are exposing themselves to greater risk of change in interest rates. The borrower may have to refinance the loan at a higher interest rate in the future, which may cause financial distress to the borrower. Option (2) is incorrect because a a borrower, with a higher maximum allowable loan, may still opt to arrange a new loan with another lender in the future. Option (3) is incorrect because a loan with shorter term and higher maximum allowable loan would expose the borrower to a greater risk of change in interest rates. Option (4) is incorrect because the lower interest rate would mean less interest is paid."
"Question 457: Which of the following statements regarding financial covenants of the mortgagor (borrower) is FALSE? 
(1)The three main financial obligations of the borrower in addition to repayment of the loan amount include payment of property taxes, property insurance, and property maintenance. 
(2)Lenders always make the property tax payments for the borrower to ensure that the property taxes do not fall into arrears. 
(3)The mortgage loan agreement should contain a covenant by the borrower to insure the property against fire and other specified hazards to the full insurable value of the security. 
(4)The borrower should maintain the property in a manner that will preserve the value of the security in order to reduce the capital risk.","Answer: 2 Explanation: Option (2) is false. Many, but not all lenders, will set up a separate tax account that the borrower will pay into every periodic payment. This provides security to the lender that their mortgage is the highest priority charge, as well as relieves the borrower from having to make a lump sum payment for property taxes. This strategy requires additional administration by the lender, so typically smaller or private lenders will leave the property tax payments to the borrower. Option (1) is incorrect because borrowers have the obligation to include payment of property taxes, insurance, and maintenance. Option (3) is incorrect because there should be a covenant included in the mortgage loan agreement to insure against fire and other hazards for the property. Option (4) is incorrect because borrowers should be maintaining the property condition as to not reduce the value of the property. This is necessary to reduce capital risk."
"Question 458: Mary and John own a piece of real property as joint tenants. Which of the following is TRUE? 
(1)Mary cannot sell or mortgage her interest without John’s consent. 
(2)Mary and John must each have an undivided interest in the whole of the property. 
(3)Because Mary and John are married, they were required by law to register their co-ownership as joint tenants. 
(4)All of the above","Answer: 2 Explanation: Option (2) is correct because in a joint tenancy, each co-owner owns an undivided interest in the whole of the estate. Option (1) is incorrect, because, Mary may still sell or mortgage her interest without John’s consent as a joint tenant (although doing so will convert the co-ownership to a tenancy in common by severing the unity of title). Option (3) is incorrect because, although married people or people in close relationships often use joint tenancies for tax planning purposes, there is no requirement for married couples who are co-owners of a property to register as joint tenants in, and they are free to co-own as tenants in common if they prefer to do so."
"Question 459: With respect to commercial tenancies, the covenant of quiet enjoyment is BEST described as which of the following? 
(1)An implied covenant that the landlord will refrain and will cause others to refrain from making noise such that it would interfere with the conduct of the tenant’s business 
(2)An assurance that the tenant will conduct their business in such a manner as to obey all noise bylaws 
(3)An assurance that all unfurnished premises be fit for human habitation 
(4)An assurance to the tenant against the consequences of a defective title involving the landlord or those lawfully claiming under the landlord","Answer: 4 Explanation: Option (4) is correct because quiet enjoyment is an assurance to the tenant against the consequences of a defective title, i.e., it assures the tenant of the use and enjoyment of the premises for all usual purposes without physical interference or unreasonable disturbance from the landlord. Option (1) is incorrect because the implied covenant of quiet enjoyment does not concern noise that interferes specifically with the tenant’s business. Option (2) is incorrect because the implied covenant of quiet enjoyment is an implied promise given by the landlord to the tenant, and does not restrict the tenant’s own conduct on the property. Option (3) is incorrect because the implied covenant of quiet enjoyment does not concern the premise’s fitness for habitation."
"Question 460: Which of the following is NOT a reason why an investor would use borrowed funds instead of an all cash offer for a real estate investment?

(3)To reduce overall risk by using only part of the borrower’s total funds for any one investment

Options (1), (2), and (3) are all reasons to use borrowed funds in a real estate investment."
"Question 461: Which of the following statements pertaining to British Columbia’s Electronic Transactions Act is TRUE? 
(1)An offer or acceptance communicated through electronic means is never legally binding. 
(2)Listing agreements are not covered by the Electronic Transactions Act. 
(3)Documents that create an interest in land and require registration to be effective against third parties are covered by the Electronic Transactions Act. 
(4)When a British Columbia statute references a written document, it does not exclude electronic documents merely because they are in electronic form.","Answer: 4 Explanation: Option (4) is true and is the correct answer: when a BC statute makes references to “written” documents or signatures, it will not exclude electronic documents and signatures merely because they are in electronic form. Option (1) is false because a legally binding contract may be formed by an offer or acceptance communicated through electronic means, but only if the parties so intend. Option (2) is false because certain documents that relate to land or land transactions, including listing agreements, are covered by the Act. Option (3) is false because documents that create or transfer interest in land and that require registration to be effective against third parties are specifically excluded from the Act."

"Question 463: In a binding contract, a condition precedent can BEST be described as: 
(1)a “subject to” clause that gives a party sole discretion over whether or not to proceed with a sale. 
(2)a condition or event, the occurrence of which will discharge the principal obligations of a party to the contract. 
(3)a condition allowing a seller to terminate the contract when a buyer defaults on deposit obligations. 
(4)a condition that must occur before a party is liable to perform their principal obligations under the contract.","Answer: 4 Explanation: Option (4) is correct because a condition precedent is the legal term for a “subject to” clause. It calls for the happening of some event or the performance of some act before the contract is binding upon the parties. Option (1) is incorrect because a binding contract does not exist when a “subject to” clause gives one party sole discretion over whether or not to proceed with a sale. When a subject clause is wholly subjective, the court may view the arrangement, in law, as nothing more than an offer. Option (2) is incorrect because it describes a condition subsequent, not a condition precedent. While a condition subsequent is an event that will discharge the principal obligations of a party to the contract, a condition precedent is an event that must occur before the parties are bound to the contract. Option (3) is incorrect because it provides an example of a condition subsequent."
"Question 464: Which of the following is an example of an equitable mortgage? 
(1)Mortgage of the equity of redemption 
(2)Agreement to execute a legal mortgage 
(3)Mortgage by way of deposit of the duplicate certificate of title 
(4)All of the above","Answer: 4 Explanation: Option (4) is correct because a mortgage of the equity of redemption, an agreement to execute a legal mortgage, and a mortgage by way of deposit of the duplicate certificate of title are all examples of ways to create equitable mortgages. A mortgage of the equity of redemption is a mortgage of the equitable interest in the land that the borrower retains after granting a legal mortgage. An agreement to grant a mortgage in the future is recognized as a present equitable mortgage. A mortgage by way of deposit of the duplicate certificate of title occurs when a bank requires the duplicate certificate as collateral security for a demand loan."
"Question 465: Where a seller sells a unit of subdivided land in British Columbia and the subdivision is a development property:

(2)the unit of subdivided land is called a subdivision unit. 
(3)the buyer has the right to rescind the purchase agreement at any time by providing appropriate notice, if the seller has not provided a disclosure statement to the buyer. 
(4)None of the above are correct.","Answer: 3 Explanation: Option (3) is correct because a purchaser has a right to rescind the purchase agreement if the developer fails to deliver a disclosure statement to the purchaser by serving a written notice of rescission on the developer under the Real Estate Development Marketing Act (REDMA). Option (1) is incorrect because REDMA applies to the marketing of development units in a development property, and subdivisions are included as development properties. Option (2) is incorrect because the a subdivided lot in a development property is called a development unit."

(3)Miss Jones receives an urgent message stating that she has been accepted as a teacher to children in Nigeria. In the course of one week, she arranges the sale of her condominium and leaves for Africa. 
(4)ABC Corporation sold its office building to its subsidiary company as a part of a corporate restructuring.",Answer: 2 Explanation: Option (2) is the best evidence of market value because of the similarity and recent nature of the sale of the homes. Option (1) is incorrect because the subject property has unique characteristics that was sold to a special purchaser. Option (3) is incorrect because the urgency of Miss Jones’ sale will likely have an unpredictable influence on the sale price. Option (4) is incorrect because this is an example of a sale between related parties (a special relationship) where the sale price may be discounted to less than market value.

(1)Risks willingly accepted by a person as their own risks 
(2)The condition of the premises 
(3)Activities on the premises 
(4)The conduct of third parties on the premises","Answer: 1 Explanation: Option (1) is correct because under section 3(3) of the Occupiers Liability Act, an occupier has no duty of care to a person in respect of risks willingly assumed by that person (other than a duty not to create a danger with intent to do harm to the person or damage or the person’s property, or to act with reckless disregard to the safety of the person or the integrity of the person’s property). Options (2), (3), and (4) are incorrect because under section 3(2) of the Occupiers Liability Act, the duty of care owed by an occupier applies in relation to the condition of the premises, the activities on the premises, or the conduct of third parties on the premises."
"Question 469: In which one of the following situations is the residual method of appraisal the MOST suitable method to use? 
(1)Where the market supply and demand forces are fairly constant 
(2)Where there is a large volume of available market data and the subject property represents the highest and best use of the site 
(3)Where the value to be measured is market value expressed as an income flow 
(4)Where the subject property possesses development potential","Answer: 4 Explanation: Option (4) is correct because the residual method is most appropriate for properties with latent value or (re)development potential. Options (1), (2), and (3) are incorrect."
"Question 470: A $170,000 mortgage loan, written at a nominal rate of 7% per annum, compounded semi-annually, has a two-year contractual term. Payments are made monthly and are based on a 20-year amortization period. Payments are rounded to the next higher dollar. What is the size of the required payments?

"Question 471: The selling price of a property is $175,000. The buyer has applied to a lender for mortgage funds and been told that the maximum loan he can obtain is $122,500. The lender’s appraiser feels that a long-term conservative estimate of the property’s value is $153,125. Which one of the following statements is TRUE? 
(1)The lending value of this property is $122,500. 
(2)The lending value of this property is $175,000. 
(3)The loan-to-value ratio on this loan is 70%. 
(4)The loan-to-value ratio on this loan is 80%.","Answer: 4 Explanation: From the information given, calculate the loan-to-value ratio. This will be the maximum loan divided by the lending value. $122,500 ÷ $153,125 = 0.8 Option (4) is true; therefore, Option (3) must be false. The lending value of the property is what the appraiser estimates the property value to be. In this case, the lending value is $153,125. Therefore, Options (1) and (2) are false."
"Question 472: Sally contracted to purchase sewing machines wholesale at $100.00 each, with a delivery date of November 30. The wholesaler did not deliver the machines until December 31. Sally had a buyer on November 30 willing to pay $250 each for the machines but by December 31 the value had dropped to only $75.00 each. Which is Sally’s BEST remedy against the wholesaler? 
(1)Quantum meruit 
(2)Specific performance 
(3)Damages 
(4)Injunction","Answer: 3 Explanation: Option (3) is correct because a damage award would put Sally in the position she would have been in if the contract had been performed as promised, so she would be able to recover the money she lost from the value of the sewing machines dropping as a result of the wholesaler’s breach. Option (1) is incorrect because quantum meruit would only be awarded when the price was not fixed in the contract (and so the court implies a promise to pay a reasonable sum). In this case, the price was stipulated in the contract. Options (2) and (4) are incorrect because the court will refuse to grant equitable remedies (such as specific performance and injunction) when damages are an adequate remedy, as they are in this case."

"Question 474: An individual is planning to purchase a property that has a list price of $69,000. The proposed purchase price will be $67,000 and the lender will apply a lending value of $66,000. How large will the down payment be if the lender insists on a maximum loan-to-value ratio of 80%? 
(1)$14,200 
(2)$16,500 
(3)$50,250 
(4)$52,800","Answer: 1 Explanation: Max loan = Lending value × Loan-to-value Max loan = $66,000 × 0.80 Max loan = $52,800 This is the amount of their mortgage. The question asks for the down payment. If the purchase price is $67,000, and the mortgage is $52,800, then the down payment is equal to the difference of $14,200 ($67,000  $52,800)."
"Question 475: Where a buyer makes an offer to purchase land, and does NOT pay a deposit: 
(1)acceptance by the seller will not form a contract. 
(2)the licensee should personally pay $1.00 of their own money into the brokerage’s trust account. 
(3)a contract will be formed on acceptance without existence of a deposit. 
(4)the “offer” is actually just an invitation to treat.","Answer: 3 Explanation: Option (3) is correct because a contract is formed where there is offer, acceptance, and consideration. In the case of a contract to purchase land, the consideration is the promise to convey title to the purchaser in exchange for the purchase price – the deposit is not required as consideration in order for a valid contract to be formed. Option (1) is incorrect for the same reason. Option (2) is incorrect because there is no requirement for the licensee to pay his or her own money into the brokerage’s trust account where a buyer makes an offer to purchase land without a deposit. Option (4) is incorrect because the offer is treated as an offer so long as it is capable of being unequivocally accepted, regardless of whether or not a deposit is paid."
"Question 476: In addition to carrying out the functions of a trading services representative, a validly licensed representative is entitled to: 
(1)carry out trading services for an unlicensed real estate brokerage. 
(2)be the managing broker of their own proprietorship. 
(3)carry out trading services for close personal friends and business associates although not employed by a brokerage. 
(4)do none of the above.","Answer: 4 Explanation: Option (4) is correct because, under the Real Estate Services Act, a licensed representative is not entitled to carry out trading services for an unlicensed brokerage, to be the managing broker of their own proprietorship, or to carry out trading services without being employed by a brokerage."
"Question 477: Which of the following statements about Duplicate Certificates of Title is TRUE? 
(1)Duplicate certificates of title cannot be issued if the property is subject to a mortgage. 
(2)Certain documents, including easements and builders liens, cannot be registered if a duplicate certificate of title has been taken out of the Land Title Office. 
(3)A duplicate certificate of title is automatically issued to each registered owner at the time when title is transferred. 
(4)The deposit of a duplicate title is considered to be the most preferable measure of security that a borrower can provide to a lender because it completely prevents the conveyance of a property.","Answer: 1 Explanation: Option (1) is correct because duplicate certificates of title cannot be issued if title is subject to a mortgage or an agreement for sale. Option (2) is incorrect because while transfers, mortgages, and long-term leases cannot be registered if a duplicate title is out of the land title office, some specific documents, including easements and builders liens, can still be registered. Option (3) is incorrect because a duplicate title will only be issued upon a written request of the registered owner. Option (4) is incorrect because most lenders prefer a registered mortgage as security."
"Question 478: A Court has power to re-open a mortgage transaction where, having regard to the risk and to all the circumstances, it is of the opinion that the cost of borrowing is excessive or harsh and unconscionable. In which one of the following statutes is this power contained? 
(1)Interest Act 
(2)Mortgage Brokers Act 
(3)Real Estate Services Act 
(4)Business Practices and Consumer Protection Act","Answer: 4 Explanation: Option (4) is correct because the Business Practices and Consumer Protection Act allows the court to intervene and effectively rewrite the transaction where it considers the cost of the loan to be excessive or the transaction is harsh and unconscionable. Options (1), (2), and (3) are incorrect because the Interest Act, the Mortgage Brokers Act, and the Real Estate Services Act do not confer this power on the courts."

(1)Paula should be given a credit for the estimated taxes between May 1 and December 31. 
(2)Vince should be charged the estimated taxes from January 1 to April 30. 
(3)There is no way to attempt a tax adjustment until the actual bill arrives. 
(4)The taxes will appear as a debit on Paula’s statement of adjustment and a credit on Vince’s statement of adjustment.","Answer: 2 Explanation: Option (2) is correct because in the case that taxes are to be paid in the future by the buyer, the seller’s share from January 1 to the adjustment date will be a debit on the seller’s statement of adjustments and will reduce the cash proceeds due to him. Option (1) is incorrect because Paula should be given a credit for the estimated taxes between January 1 and April 30 (i.e., the time that Vince owned the property), not from May 1 to December 31. Option (3) is incorrect because of the amount of taxes is not yet known, it will be calculated based on estimates. Option (4) is incorrect because the taxes will appear as a credit on Paula’s statement and a debit on Vince’s statement."

(1)A licensee must always act in the best interests of both their clients and non-clients. 
(2)A licensee must act with reasonable care and skill to both clients and non-clients. 
(3)A licensee owes an ethical duty of loyalty to non-clients. 
(4)A licensee who breaches an ethical duty to a client can still be acting ethically.","Answer: 2 Explanation: Option (2) is correct because licensees owe a duty to act with reasonable care and skill to all parties, including both clients and non-clients. Option (1) is incorrect because a licensee must act in the best interests of their client in a transaction. They do not have a duty to act in the best interests of non-clients.

"Question 484: Marissa owns a 45-year-old apartment building. All six suites are rented out at below-market rents and the current leases are not up for renewal for another two years. The apartment building is situated in a block in which all of the other apartment buildings have been torn down and replaced with office buildings. In addition, the apartment is situated on land zoned for commercial purposes. Which of the following statements is TRUE about the state of Marissa’s investment? 
(1)Marissa’s apartment is not “ripe for re-development”. 
(2)The tenants’ rents will now increase. 
(3)Marissa’s apartment possesses latent value. 
(4)Marissa’s apartment is currently at highest and best use.","Answer: 3 Explanation: Option (3) is true because the apartment is in an area that is zoned for commercial use and surrounding developments are all office buildings. Given this, the apartment possesses latent value. Therefore, Option (1) is incorrect as the property is “ripe for re-development”. Option (2) is incorrect because the tenants’ rent cannot increase until the lease renewal in two years. Option (4) is incorrect because the apartment is not at its highest and best use if it possesses latent value."
"Question 485: Which of the following statements comparing cooperatives and condominiums is TRUE? 
(1)Both condominiums and cooperatives are created by filing a plan in the land title office. 
(2)Buyers of both condominiums and cooperatives acquire a fee simple interest in the real property on which the purchased unit is situated. 
(3)Buyers of condominiums will generally find it easier to finance their purchase than will buyers of cooperatives. 
(4)Both owners of condominiums and owners of cooperatives are equally free to sell their units to whomever they wish.","Answer: 3 Explanation: Option (3) is correct because, since the cooperative owner is a tenant of the cooperative corporation and they do not own an estate in land, financing of a cooperative purchase may be more difficult as a buyer can only grant the lender a security interest in his or her shares under the Personal Property Security Act and, if not prohibited by the corporation, a mortgage of his or her leasehold interest. Banks and lending institutions are less willing to lend on this form of security. Option (1) is incorrect because, while a fee simple strata property is created by a strata plan which is filed in the land title office, a cooperative is created by the incorporation of a company or a cooperative association. Option (2) is incorrect because cooperative ownership does not bestow an individual fee simple title to the cooperative owner’s unit; rather, the owner in a cooperative possesses shares in a non-profit corporation which in turn holds title to the land. Option (4) is incorrect because strata lot owners are generally not restricted in any way as to whom he/she wishes to sell the strata lot to, whereas a cooperative owner typically must have the buyer approved by the cooperative association’s board of directors."

(1)It is another name for capital cost allowance. 
(2)It is an accounting concept that attempts to allocate the cost of an asset over its useful life. 
(3)It is usually calculated on land by the straight-line method. 
(4)It is never permitted on a single-family residence.",Answer: 2 Explanation: Option (2) is correct; depreciation expense is an attempt to allocate the cost of the asset over its useful life. Option (1) is incorrect; depreciation expense is not another name for capital cost allowance (CCA) because CCA is a method of calculating depreciation for income tax purposes. Option (3) is incorrect; land is not considered to be a depreciable asset thus depreciation expense is never taken on land.

(1)Tax law 
(2)Criminal law 
(3)Agency law 
(4)Constitutional law","Answer: 3 Explanation: Option (3) is correct because agency law is concerned with matters between two (or more) individuals, and so it would fall within the body of private law rather than public law.

(1)Increase the capitalization rate 
(2)Deduct the amount of the repair in the year it is expected to be incurred 
(3)Apportion the amount of the repair to an annual allowance 
(4)Reduce the eventual sale price of the property to reflect depreciation","Answer: 3 Explanation: Option (3) is correct because when using the income approach, an appropriate annual allowance or reserve should be made to cover the total cost of periodic repairs. For example, to cover the cost of painting every three years, one-third of the total painting cost could be allocated as an expense each year. Options (1), (2), and (4) are therefore incorrect."

(3)Family trusts allow a parent to deposit assets with a trustee and distribute the income to other members of the family. 
(4)Mortgage trusts and equity trusts are two types of REITs.","Answer: 2 Explanation: Option (2) is correct because income earned by a family trust will be taxed separately for each beneficiary, at each of their own personal tax rates.

(3)Newsletters should include several large, high quality photos. 
(4)Newsletters should include an option for subscribers to opt out of receiving future communications.","Answer: 4 Explanation: Option (4) is correct because it is true. Option (1) is incorrect because newsletters should not be sent more frequently than once a week. Option (2) is incorrect because a newsletter should provide compelling content, such as market news, local events, real estate-related tips, and information on new housing developments. Option (3) is incorrect because even though pictures can enhance the look of the newsletter, one must remember to keep the file size of the newsletter small so the message is easily received."

(1)for the seller. 
(2)for the buyer. 
(3)as agent for both.

"Question 497: Which of the following statements about the law in British Columbia governing occupiers’ liability is FALSE? 
(1)Under the statute, there can be more than one occupier of land at the same time. 
(2)An occupier’s liability does not extend to risks willingly assumed by a visitor at their own risks. 
(3)The language of the Occupiers Liability Act expressly preserves the common law distinction between the different types of visitors. 
(4)The language of the Occupiers Liability Act would probably allow for the imposition of a lesser standard of care to be owed to a trespasser than to a person with permission to be on the premises.","Answer: 3 Explanation: Option (3) is correct because the Occupiers Liability Act (OLA) has removed the common law distinction between different types of visitors. Option (1) is incorrect because section 1 of the OLA specifies that there may be more than one occupier of the same premises. Option (2) is incorrect because section 3 of the OLA states that an occupier has no duty of care in respect of risks willingly assumed by a visitor, other than a duty not to create a danger with intent to do harm to the person or damage to the person’s property, or to act with reckless disregard to the safety of the person or the integrity of the person’s property. Option (4) is incorrect because the legislation specifies that the duty of care imposed on an occupier is to take such care as is reasonable in the circumstances, so it is likely that the standard owed in the circumstances of someone trespassing on the property would be lower than that owed to an invited guest."
"Question 498: You have a partially completed appraisal report that you need to fill in.

This 2,300 square foot comparable sold for $250,000, has 4 bedrooms, and was adjusted +$4,200 for bedrooms and +$15,000 for square footage. If the market value of a bedroom is $4,200 and above a 1,900 sq. ft. benchmark, each 100 sq. ft. is worth $5,000, it can be concluded that the subject property has: 
(1)5 bedrooms and 2,300 square feet. 
(2)4 bedrooms and 2,000 square feet. 
(3)3 bedrooms and 2,200 square feet. 
(4)5 bedrooms and 2,600 square feet.","Answer: 4 Explanation: Option (4) is correct because the square foot adjustment for the property is +$15,000. We know that each additional 100 square feet is worth $5,000, so $15,000 ÷ $5,000 = 300 sq ft bigger than the comparable property. Therefore, the total square footage of the subject property is 2,300 + 300 = 2,600. Since the comparable has 4 bedrooms and was adjusted +$4,200, the comparable has one more bedroom than the subject (5 bedrooms in subject). Options (1), (2), and (3) are therefore incorrect."

(4)The regulation of short term rental accommodations","Answer: 3 Explanation: Option (3) is correct because the development and operation of airports is an exclusively federal matter.

(3)If a mortgage document calls for interest without specifying the rate, then the rate of interest specified by law is 5% per annum. 
(4)The interest rate on arrears under a mortgage may not exceed the rate payable on the principal monies not in arrears.","Answer: 1 Explanation: Option (1) is correct because the Interest Act imposes no limit on the rate of interest which can be charged in a mortgage transaction (however, a rate of interest can be challenged under other legislation, such as the Criminal Code). Option (2) is incorrect because section 6 of the Interest Act requires that, where a mortgage requires blended payments, the mortgage document must contain a statement of the interest rate calculated either “yearly or half-yearly not in advance.” Option (3) is incorrect because under section 3 of the Interest Act, if a document requires interest to be paid but the rate is not set out, then the rate allocated by law is 5% per annum. Option (4) is incorrect because section 8 of the Interest Act states that the interest rate on arrears cannot be greater than the regular rate payable on the principal."
